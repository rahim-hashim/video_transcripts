# The Trial Mark Zuckerberg Couldn’t Prevent
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=5.04s)]
*  Testimonies began this week in one of the most aggressive cases the government has ever [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=15.92s)]
*  brought against a big tech company. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=19.740000000000002s)]
*  And over the next eight weeks, the Federal Trade Commission will argue that Metta, the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=22.44s)]
*  company founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his college dorm room, should be broken up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=27.28s)]
*  Today, my colleague Cecilia Kang on the strange and contentious relationship between Zuckerberg [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=32.36s)]
*  and President Trump that has led to this moment, and what the case means for both of them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=38.56s)]
*  It's Thursday, April 17th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=47.0s)]
*  Cecilia, you are talking to me from your car, I believe. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=51.68s)]
*  Why are you talking to me from your car? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I had to run to my car because I'm on a lunch break during an antitrust trial where [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to break up Metta. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=68.48s)]
*  And this is a really high stakes case for Metta and for Mark Zuckerberg because this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=72.8s)]
*  case really threatens the company's entire existence. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=78.74s)]
*  It's existential because the government is trying to break up this company that he co-founded [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=82.7s)]
*  two decades ago. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=89.58s)]
*  And I have just spent the first half of this week watching Zuckerberg testify as the first [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=91.5s)]
*  and star witness in the government's case against Metta. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  And when I go back, he will finish up and then we will have the former chief operating [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=102.24s)]
*  officer, Sheryl Sandberg, testify. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=107.38s)]
*  What's the first week been like? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=110.42s)]
*  It's been pretty crazy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  Long lines to get into the courtroom. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=113.88s)]
*  The courtroom itself is full of Metta's many, many lawyers, as well as the FTC's lawyers [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=117.42s)]
*  and media and a lot of just people from the public. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  And it's interesting because up until really the minutes before the trial began, I wasn't [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=127.92s)]
*  even sure that it was going to happen. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=133.48s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=136.16s)]
*  In recent weeks, senior Facebook officials have been trying to get the White House to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=137.16s)]
*  stop this case from going to trial. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=143.68s)]
*  And recently, as we reported, Mark Zuckerberg was at the White House himself meeting with [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=147.24s)]
*  the president and his top aides, trying to get the president to drop this case before [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=151.36s)]
*  it could go to trial. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=157.12s)]
*  And so this case, which has huge implications, can be seen as a reflection of this ongoing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=158.8s)]
*  and strange relationship between these two men, Zuckerberg and President Trump. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=165.24s)]
*  It's sort of surprising to hear what you're saying because we've talked on the show about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=170.9s)]
*  how the big tech giants have been increasingly cozying up to President Trump. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=174.84s)]
*  I think a lot of people, myself included, saw photos of Zuckerberg at the inauguration. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  I sort of had the impression that these two men were at least a little bit warm toward [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  each other. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=188.06s)]
*  So maybe you could just unpack this a little bit. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=189.06s)]
*  What exactly is their relationship and how has it affected this case? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=191.1s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=196.56s)]
*  The story of Zuckerberg and Trump really goes back almost a decade, and their relationship [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  has really changed and evolved over those years. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=203.7s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that what started as a story of two very powerful, but very [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=206.98s)]
*  different and maybe even opposing figures has turned into something quite different. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=212.38s)]
*  Lately, Zuckerberg has been very positive about Trump. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=218.26s)]
*  He's really tried to get into Trump's inner circle. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=221.94s)]
*  But Trump at this point has not returned the same sort of interest nor affection. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=226.92s)]
*  I would say that the relationship is pretty one-sided at this point. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=233.88s)]
*  Zuckerberg, for most of Facebook's history, has never been overtly political. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  It's actually sort of a mystery as to how he votes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=244.48s)]
*  He donates to both parties. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=246.96s)]
*  He's not particularly vocal about politics generally. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=248.96s)]
*  Things get a little bit more complicated when it comes to Trump's first election victory [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=257.76s)]
*  That was a huge deal for Facebook, but not necessarily in a positive way. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=259.72s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  Facebook was really widely seen as one of the reasons that Trump won the election. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=270.76s)]
*  The left blamed Facebook for Trump's victory. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=271.76s)]
*  They say that there was a surge of political misinformation that really helped Trump in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=275.44s)]
*  winning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=280.92s)]
*  And Zuckerberg reacts to these concerns by creating new policies and new changes to the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=282.08s)]
*  platform, instituting things like fact checking, all with the purpose of trying to slow the [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=288.82s)]
*  spread of misinformation on the site. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=294.2s)]
*  And the right hates this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=296.76s)]
*  They say that these actions are essentially censorship and censorship of conservatives. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=298.62s)]
*  They say that the company's leaders and their employees are liberal and they have a bias [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=304.56s)]
*  that's against conservatives in Trump. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=310.16s)]
*  And Trump comes out for the first time as anti-Facebook. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=313.32s)]
*  It sounds like hating Facebook basically becomes like a bipartisan issue at this point. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=317.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=321.32s)]
*  At this point, we're starting to see Facebook getting caught in between both political parties. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=322.32s)]
*  And eventually, the Federal Trade Commission under the Trump administration decides to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=327.62s)]
*  sue in December 2020, which was right before they leave office. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=332.08s)]
*  That lawsuit leads to the trial that I've been covering this week. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  And then on January 6, we know what happens. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=343.52s)]
*  Trump's supporters storm the Capitol. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=348.36s)]
*  And at first, he is urging the crowds. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=350.84s)]
*  And while his supporters are in the Capitol building and police are trying to take control [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=355.08s)]
*  the situation, Trump addresses his supporters in a video. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=359.2s)]
*  I know you're pain. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  I know you're hurt. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=364.2s)]
*  We had an election that was stolen from us. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=365.96s)]
*  It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=369.59999999999997s)]
*  That video is posted across social media, including Facebook and Instagram. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  People in law and order, we don't want anybody hurt. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=379.12s)]
*  It's a very tough period of time. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=382.24s)]
*  There's never been a time like this where. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=384.52s)]
*  Employees of the company as well as the public are very concerned with Trump's speech. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=387.76s)]
*  What Facebook decides to do next is very important. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=393.64s)]
*  They decide to remove those videos and they cite a policy that the company has on speech. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=396.84s)]
*  The company forbids any sort of incitement of violence. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=403.23999999999995s)]
*  And then Facebook escalates. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  Facebook decides to remove Trump entirely off the platform. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  Trump interprets that as a shot across the bow. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=418.28s)]
*  And at that point, he determines that Facebook is an enemy. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  But when President Biden comes into office, all of a sudden it is Zuckerberg feeling like [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=427.28s)]
*  Facebook is being censored. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=435.2s)]
*  How so? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=437.2s)]
*  The real flash point was during the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=438.2s)]
*  When the Biden White House was reaching out to Facebook senior executives and really railing [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=442.88s)]
*  on them to clamp down on misinformation related to the virus. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=448.68s)]
*  The Biden administration, according to Zuckerberg and employees at Metta, was quite strict about [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=454.44s)]
*  what kind of information that they thought was misinformation. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=459.96s)]
*  Any sort of skepticism about the vaccine, as well as any sort of conversation even around [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=464.2s)]
*  COVID where there might have been either just questions raised or maybe even satirical [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=469.24s)]
*  content about COVID-19 was the subject of real scrutiny by the Biden administration. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=474.44s)]
*  And White House officials were telling Metta that they need to take down all that content, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=481.76s)]
*  which Metta thought was a real overreach. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=487.04s)]
*  And in fact, the relationship between Metta and the Biden administration only gets worse [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=490.36s)]
*  once Biden appoints a real trust buster, Lena Kahn, to be his top antitrust regulator. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=498.2s)]
*  Lena is a well-known figure within the very small and esoteric world of antitrust law. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=505.2s)]
*  And she is seen as one of the biggest threats across corporate America. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=512.28s)]
*  And Lena Kahn picks up that antitrust suit against Metta that was initiated in the Trump [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=517.4399999999999s)]
*  administration. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=523.72s)]
*  So it sounds like at this point, basically, Zuckerberg and the Biden administration could [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=524.96s)]
*  not be farther apart. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=529.4000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=531.12s)]
*  The animosity between the Biden administration and Metta only grows. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=532.12s)]
*  And the company's feeling very much like a target. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  So as Zuckerberg's relationship with Biden is deteriorating, what's going on with his [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=543.46s)]
*  relationship to Trump at this point in time? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, the real inflection point was the assassination attempt on Trump. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=551.76s)]
*  And that was a moment when Mark Zuckerberg saw Trump emerge and stand up from that stage [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=557.24s)]
*  in Pennsylvania with his fist pumped in the air, blood coming down his face. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=567.24s)]
*  Zuckerberg later commented that he thought that was such a moment of heroism. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=573.32s)]
*  One of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=577.84s)]
*  And that he thought that, in his words, that Trump was a real badass. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  I think, look, at some level as an American, it's like hard to not get kind of emotional [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=584.8s)]
*  about that spirit and that fight. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=589.68s)]
*  And I think that that's why a lot of people like the guy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  And that was the first time that I'd heard Zuckerberg really speak out so positively [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=596.16s)]
*  about a political candidate. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  He'd been very careful for many years to not take any strong position in politics. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=602.8s)]
*  And then after the 2024 election, things really started to pick up. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=611.92s)]
*  We see Zuckerberg almost racing to show his affection for Trump. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=617.76s)]
*  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had a private meeting with the president-elect today at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=623.0s)]
*  First, he publicly congratulates the president on his election. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, Mark Zuckerberg's been over to see me and... [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=631.92s)]
*  He visits the president-elect in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=638.28s)]
*  You know, chill week. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=640.04s)]
*  Yeah, sort of. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=641.2s)]
*  He goes on the Joe Rogan podcast. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=643.24s)]
*  And it's one of the things that I'm optimistic about with President Trump is, I think he [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=646.12s)]
*  just wants America to win. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=650.68s)]
*  And for quite some time talks about how much he admired the president. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=652.48s)]
*  These people from the Biden administration would call up our team and like scream at [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=657.16s)]
*  them and curse. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=662.92s)]
*  And how he had become so frustrated with the Democratic-led former White House. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=664.52s)]
*  Hey, everyone, I want to talk about something important today. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=670.64s)]
*  We see Zuckerberg also change policies within the company. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=673.64s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=677.56s)]
*  First, we're going to get rid of fact checkers and replace them with community notes similar [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=679.16s)]
*  to X starting in the US. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=683.88s)]
*  He gets rid of fact checking. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=686.04s)]
*  What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  opinions and shut out people with different ideas. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=692.8s)]
*  And it's gone too far. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=695.8s)]
*  And he also gets rid of DEI, diversity, equity, inclusion, sort of efforts of the company. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=702.88s)]
*  speech. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=707.3599999999999s)]
*  These two big policy changes seem very much aligned with the Trump agenda. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=708.0s)]
*  And for a prime example of how Trump went from pariah to powerful, look to meta. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=713.76s)]
*  The company confirms it made a million dollar contribution to Trump's inaugural fund. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=719.6s)]
*  Meta donates a million dollars to the Trump inauguration. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=724.32s)]
*  He's really pulling out all the stops. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=734.4s)]
*  He's pulling out all the stops. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=736.64s)]
*  It's happening in rapid fire all within a compressed few weeks. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  And, you know, whether or not he believes in President Trump or whether he's just trying [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=742.08s)]
*  to do the best thing for his companies, I guess that doesn't really matter because he's [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=747.16s)]
*  gone full MAGA, right? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=750.76s)]
*  Like he's fully aligning himself with the new administration. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=751.9599999999999s)]
*  But I have to note that looking at where we are today, it doesn't seem like any of that [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  helped him that much. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=758.92s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel, I don't think so. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=760.92s)]
*  The president still holds a grudge against Zuckerberg and Meta. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  And as somebody very close to the president told me just a few days ago, the president [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=769.64s)]
*  still wants his pound of flesh. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=775.96s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=785.32s)]
*  So, Cecilia, we just talked about how Zuckerberg couldn't get Trump to make this case go away. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=786.28s)]
*  But what exactly is the case that the government is bringing here? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=809.8s)]
*  Yeah, this case is really pretty novel in that this all centers around two acquisitions [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=814.9200000000001s)]
*  more than a decade ago, the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=821.08s)]
*  And what the federal government is arguing is that Facebook had a monopoly when they [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=825.72s)]
*  bought these companies. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=831.1600000000001s)]
*  And through these acquisitions, they were able to keep their monopoly. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=832.36s)]
*  The reason why that is such an eyebrow raising argument in particular is because the very [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=836.6s)]
*  agency that is suing Meta was the agency that approved those mergers more than a decade [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=843.96s)]
*  ago in the first place. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=849.0s)]
*  Okay, explain that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=850.76s)]
*  So I've got to take you back in a time machine to around 2011, 2012. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=852.68s)]
*  And this was a really pivotal time for Facebook. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=858.4399999999999s)]
*  Facebook really struggled to create an app for the smartphone. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=862.4399999999999s)]
*  And they were starting to see competition, particularly from Instagram, that made Mark [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=866.6s)]
*  Zuckerberg very nervous because Instagram had this new and very interesting photo sharing [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=872.2s)]
*  app. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=879.08s)]
*  And so Zuckerberg in 2012 decided to buy Instagram, which didn't have that many users [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=879.72s)]
*  and had very few employees for a billion dollars. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=886.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=890.2800000000001s)]
*  That in itself was a big deal at that time. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=890.76s)]
*  But regulators thought that it was such a small company, Instagram, and it didn't directly [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=893.72s)]
*  compete with Facebook as a social network that they felt comfortable allowing that merger [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=899.16s)]
*  to go through. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=904.92s)]
*  And then Zuckerberg got nervous again. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=906.8399999999999s)]
*  Around 2014, he saw the rise of messaging apps like WeChat in China and WhatsApp, which was [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=909.88s)]
*  an app that was very popular globally, really picking up steam and getting tons of users [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=919.56s)]
*  around the world. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=925.72s)]
*  And he was afraid that those kinds of messaging apps could also compete with Facebook because [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=926.84s)]
*  they could take on more social features like sharing between friends and family. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=933.1600000000001s)]
*  So then in 2014, he buys WhatsApp for $19 billion. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=938.6800000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=942.9200000000001s)]
*  Huge price tag that drew a ton of interest at the time. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=943.96s)]
*  But again, regulators said, you know, this app doesn't directly compete with Facebook. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=947.1600000000001s)]
*  So yes, we'll approve it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=952.36s)]
*  So both mergers approved by the Federal Trade Commission. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=954.8399999999999s)]
*  So it sounds like from what you're saying that there weren't any alarm bells ringing at the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=959.0799999999999s)]
*  time when Facebook was acquiring these companies. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=963.3199999999999s)]
*  But obviously something changed. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=965.56s)]
*  What changed and why? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=967.4s)]
*  Well, a couple things changed. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=969.48s)]
*  First, Facebook becomes very powerful. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=971.8s)]
*  It hits 3.5 billion users. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=975.0799999999999s)]
*  And that sheer scale puts a spotlight on Facebook. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=978.1999999999999s)]
*  Suddenly, people see that it has become an essential place for so many people around [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=983.0s)]
*  the world to obtain and to share information. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=988.68s)]
*  And once people start recognizing that, especially around the 2016 and 2020 elections, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=992.6s)]
*  it changes the perception of Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=998.28s)]
*  The other thing that changes is that regulators start looking at the Silicon Valley companies [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1001.72s)]
*  very differently. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1006.76s)]
*  They see that these internet giants only get bigger and stronger in ways that are unexpected. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1008.1999999999999s)]
*  They start to look at acquisitions that these companies have made over the years [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1015.2399999999999s)]
*  that may have not seemed either threatening or anti-competitive at the time because [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1021.2399999999999s)]
*  these big companies are often buying very small startups. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1026.76s)]
*  But those acquisitions become really important tools for these companies to continue to grow [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1030.6s)]
*  and to maintain their monopolies. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1037.16s)]
*  It used to be that the key way to determine if a monopoly was breaking the law was whether [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1040.0400000000002s)]
*  prices were going up for consumers. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1047.3200000000002s)]
*  But how does that apply to an internet company, especially a company that has apps like [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1050.2s)]
*  Facebook and Instagram, which are free? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1055.72s)]
*  And so regulators are saying there are different ways that we should look at how these companies [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1058.28s)]
*  have too much power. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  So what is the harm that the government is arguing that Meta poses here exactly, if not [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1065.8s)]
*  ripping people off in terms of how much they're paying for a product? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1071.0s)]
*  So the government is arguing that there are other ways consumers have been harmed. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1074.68s)]
*  They say that if these mergers were not approved, that maybe Instagram and WhatsApp would have [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1078.44s)]
*  created much more competition that would spur Facebook to be more innovative and to make [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1085.56s)]
*  their app better. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1091.0s)]
*  So you might see fewer things like data privacy scandals. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1092.52s)]
*  You might see the company do a better job when it comes to containing misinformation. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1097.08s)]
*  All these things that are not related to price but do affect the consumer experience. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1101.8799999999999s)]
*  And most interestingly, the Trump administration has introduced a new wrinkle. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1107.32s)]
*  President Trump and his top antitrust regulators have argued that these platforms censor speech [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1112.44s)]
*  and that their ability to censor speech is a real sign, a symptom of a problem, which is that they're [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1120.28s)]
*  too powerful. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1127.24s)]
*  So they are arguing for the first time that I have heard a speech theory that antitrust [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1128.68s)]
*  enforcement should include concerns about speech. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1134.12s)]
*  S.K. Cecilia, I can't help but notice that Zuckerberg, who has become this free speech [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1137.6399999999999s)]
*  absolutist and rolled back so much of the company's past efforts to censor content on the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1142.44s)]
*  platform, he's actually now the target of a case the president or his administration is taking on [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1148.12s)]
*  at least in part because he thinks meta holds too much power to shape speech. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1155.3999999999999s)]
*  So it's really ironic. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1161.4799999999998s)]
*  In some ways, Zuckerberg and Trump want the same thing. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1162.6799999999998s)]
*  They want complete free speech on the Internet. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1166.52s)]
*  They want no censorship. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1169.32s)]
*  And Zuckerberg has tried to signal to Trump that, hey, we are on the same side on this issue. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1171.4799999999998s)]
*  But even though Zuckerberg has tried to do that and made so many other efforts to try to appease [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1177.32s)]
*  Trump, it really hasn't landed in the way that Zuckerberg wants and needs. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1182.84s)]
*  He still has to go through this trial. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1188.36s)]
*  And that's because even though they might agree on some things, Facebook is still viewed as simply [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1190.9199999999998s)]
*  just too big. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1198.52s)]
*  S.K. But it sort of sounds like from what you've explained that the government has a bit of an [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1199.24s)]
*  uphill battle here for two reasons. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1204.1999999999998s)]
*  One, they basically have to say, like, look, even though we approved these mergers back in the day, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1207.0s)]
*  we've changed our mind. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1211.24s)]
*  We want to unwind them, which seems tough. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1212.12s)]
*  And two, they've also got this new argument where they're trying to prove new harms in a theory [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1215.24s)]
*  that's kind of been untested before. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1223.48s)]
*  So should I take it from what you've just said that meta is feeling pretty good about its chances [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1224.1999999999998s)]
*  here? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1227.8s)]
*  S.K. I think so. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1228.3s)]
*  I think meta is coming in really confidently. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1229.48s)]
*  I think legal experts are all saying that this is a tough case for the FTC. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1232.6s)]
*  But the real question that I have as I watch Mark Zuckerberg finish his testimony this week [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1237.9599999999998s)]
*  is what is he winning here? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1245.6399999999999s)]
*  They might win this trial, but he still needs to win over the president. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1248.36s)]
*  There are so many other issues that relate to his business, and there's so much at stake with this [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1256.4399999999998s)]
*  administration as the company continues to try to expand in new areas and grow. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1261.8s)]
*  So I would say this is just one step in a very long process for meta to really get back into [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1267.8s)]
*  the good graces of Washington and particularly to, for the first time, win over Trump's support. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1277.56s)]
*  S.K. Because who knows what the next fight will be? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1283.08s)]
*  S.K. That's right. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1285.6399999999999s)]
*  And there will be many. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1286.9199999999998s)]
*  S.K. Cecilia, thank you so much. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1287.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Rachel. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1291.24s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1299.8s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1317.32s)]
*  A federal judge threatened to open a contempt investigation into whether the Trump administration [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1319.32s)]
*  violated an order the judge issued directing officials to stop planes of Venezuelan migrants [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1323.8799999999999s)]
*  from being sent to El Salvador. The judge said he would begin the proceedings against the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1329.08s)]
*  administration unless the White House gives scores of Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador a [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1333.8799999999999s)]
*  chance to challenge their removal. And on Wednesday, Britain's Supreme Court ruled that trans [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1339.48s)]
*  women do not fall within the legal definition of women under the country's equality legislation, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1346.6s)]
*  dealing a major blow to campaigners for transgender rights. While the five judges involved in the [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1352.04s)]
*  ruling said the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex, they emphasized that [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1357.56s)]
*  they were not commenting on whether trans women are women more broadly, saying it was not the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1362.76s)]
*  role of the court to adjudicate the meaning of gender or sex. Today's episode was produced by [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1367.6399999999999s)]
*  Nina Feldman and Carlos Prieto. It was edited by Brendan Klinkenberg and Mark George with help from [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1378.6s)]
*  Mike Benoit. It contains original music by Pat McCusker, Diane Wong, Marian Lozano, and was [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hnS42vj2PU&t=1384.68s)]
