# Is Trump's Nomination Now Inevitable?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRY4lho7Eck)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  If you listen to podcasts, which we know you do because you're here, you know that the
*  biggest challenge is finding great stuff to listen to.
*  The Times wants to make that a lot easier.
*  We're launching an audio app, NYT Audio, a single place where you can find the shows
*  you already know and love, like The Daily, This American Life, Serial, The Run-Up, and
*  discover a bunch of new shows that you can't get anywhere else.
*  I want to introduce you to one of them.
*  It's called The Headlines, and it pairs perfectly with The Daily.
*  As you know, The Daily tells one big story a day.
*  But The Times is covering dozens of stories a day with reporters across the world.
*  And that's where The Headlines comes in.
*  It captures even more news than The Daily does in just 10 minutes.
*  And all this week, we're going to give you The Headlines right here on The Daily feed.
*  After that, you can listen to it, along with The Daily, on the audio app.
*  So how do you get this app?
*  If you're a Times, News, or All Access subscriber, you can get it for free by going to nytimes.com
*  slash audio app, or by searching NYT Audio in the App Store.
*  If you're not a subscriber, the app is the perfect reason to become one.
*  And now, on to the show.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, as Governor Ron DeSantis is expected to enter the 2024 Republican presidential
*  race this week, he's polling well below the leading candidate, former President Donald
*  Trump.
*  It's a very different picture than just a few months ago, when midterm voters embraced
*  DeSantis and his brand of cultural conservatism, while overwhelmingly rejecting extremism and
*  Trump.
*  My colleague, Astead Herndon, host of our politics podcast, The Run-Up, has been reporting
*  on how we got from there to here, when Trump's nomination has started to feel almost inevitable.
*  It's Monday, May 22nd.
*  Astead, it's nice to see you in person.
*  It's nice to see you too.
*  Last we were in this room was the midterm election night.
*  That's right.
*  That was almost a year ago?
*  Definitely not a year ago.
*  I think actually someone is helpfully telling me that it was only six months ago.
*  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
*  Well, let's go back to that moment.
*  I mean, the last time you were on the show, right after the midterm elections, I distinctly
*  remember you saying that while the result of that midterm election was a clear rejection
*  of Donald Trump by general election voters, that didn't mean that Trumpism was over.
*  And the question that you posed heading into the next election, the 2024 presidential cycle,
*  was what's the Republican Party going to do with a disappointing set of results and with
*  the person who ushered in those disappointing results, Donald Trump?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I look back at that night and there was that feeling that Donald Trump had been
*  diminished by the electorate.
*  You had congressional leaders and conservative media asking an open question about whether
*  Donald Trump was still the kind of leader of the party because the Republican results
*  were so far from their expectations.
*  I think there was a natural political question to say, is this thing over?
*  Is this the time then when folks turn the page on Trump?
*  But at the same time, I felt like I couldn't ignore my own reporting, which is that Trumpism
*  is so deeply ingrained in the Republican Party that even something like the midterm results
*  is not inherently clear that that's enough for it to be cut out.
*  So I kind of set off to understand what the midterms impact on Trump's power was.
*  And are we now looking at a Republican Party where he is still the overwhelmingly dominant
*  political figure?
*  Or are we looking at a Republican Party where post midterms, the ground was really open
*  for a new leader to emerge?
*  Right.
*  And there's one person in particular, I remember very clearly in that moment, that people are
*  starting to look to as somebody who could take advantage of this weaker Trump.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  We're talking Ron DeSantis, right?
*  We are.
*  We are.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  I mean, Governor Ron DeSantis, because he had a good midterms night, was hoisted into
*  the position of Donald Trump alternative almost immediately.
*  And for a Republican Party where some folks have been looking for a way to turn the page
*  for a long time, he really embodied a lot of those hopes.
*  Right.
*  And he's changed a tremendous amount since then.
*  So let's understand instead how we got to this moment where things seem kind of flipped
*  on their head from that place you just described.
*  So tell us where you start your reporting and why.
*  Well, we were thinking about how to kind of untangle this question.
*  Where are the places in the Republican Party that the leadership and the decision makers
*  would be wrestling with both the reality of Trump's power and the reality of his drag
*  on the party's ability to win.
*  And what emerged for us was the RNC winter meeting in January in Dana Point, California.
*  This is a gathering of Republican insiders, the folks who actually make the decisions
*  about how to set up the primary process.
*  And this was their first party gathering since the midterm elections.
*  Right.
*  The embers are still smoldering.
*  The embers are still smoldering.
*  And what we found when we got there was a universal recognition of the party's disappointing
*  results.
*  One was in confusion that the red wave was promised, that the conditions were there and
*  that they failed to seize on it.
*  Right.
*  So when you arrive, this is a party that knows it's losing.
*  And in theory, this is going to be the place, this RNC meeting, where party officials start
*  to scheme about how they're going to win again and whether that requires ditching Donald
*  Trump.
*  Exactly.
*  It was the unspoken elephant in every room that Donald Trump was part of the reason that
*  Republicans had had such losses.
*  And for different spaces of the party, they were having much different reactions to that
*  information.
*  Can you just say your name and where you...
*  Yeah.
*  John Fredericks.
*  I am the Godzilla of truth in America.
*  You can follow me at JF radio show.
*  The first person I meet at that winter meeting was a man named John Fredericks.
*  He's a big kind of Trump embodied radio host in Virginia.
*  And he was hosting a forum at that RNC event that was meant to really put pressure on the
*  Republican insider saying, hey, the kind of Trump base is still here.
*  And I think really importantly, we are not embarrassed by those results.
*  When we went to them, they had a clear explanation for why Republicans didn't do as well as they
*  did.
*  Which is what?
*  If you want to blame Trump, don't vote for him in the upcoming primaries.
*  That's your choice.
*  You can do that if you think he's the reason.
*  Right?
*  I happen to not think he is, but she is the chairman of the Republican National Committee.
*  They thought the establishment side of Republicans, I'm talking the party apparatus, the RNC,
*  including its chair, Ronna McDaniel, and the kind of Senate coffers of money that come
*  out of DC, they felt that they had not adequately supported the Trump candidates in the midterm
*  election.
*  I guess a question I have is how are those five elections her fault, but they're not
*  Donald Trump's fault?
*  Why does she get blamed for those elections?
*  She's the chairman of the RNC.
*  She's done nothing on ballot harvesting.
*  She hasn't done anything in any of the critical areas.
*  That people like Carrie Lake or Hershel Walker or Blake Masters would have all done better
*  if the Republican Party had united around them.
*  It's just one big ring of consultants paying each other for this, that, TV ads, et cetera.
*  And so they're all making money.
*  And other than that, you have party leadership calling them bad candidates publicly and more
*  importantly not giving them the data and money that could have been at their disposal.
*  And so they really blamed the mechanics of the Republican Party for not adequately rallying
*  around the Trump candidates.
*  And that was the reason this group said they lost.
*  So to the degree that Frederick's is a proxy for the Trump base, the base is not seeing
*  Trump or the issues he cared about, like elections and nihilism, as what cost the party these
*  midterm elections.
*  It's the Republican Party that's responsible for that.
*  Absolutely.
*  It is an argument that is very convenient for them because it does not require them
*  to blame Trump or require them to blame the messages that those candidates gave.
*  But it allows them to continue a proxy war that's been happening in the Republican Party
*  for a long time where the Trump base really sees its role as overtaking the Republican
*  establishment.
*  And they were really clearly expressing that.
*  We're trying to take over the Republican Party because what it represents right now is the
*  Mitt Romney elites, right?
*  We go to the infield of NASCAR and grill hot dogs and Mitt Romney goes to the box of the
*  owner of the Jets, right?
*  That's the disconnect.
*  And eventually we're going to take over the Republican Party as a vehicle, right?
*  As a vehicle for our movement.
*  When I talked to Frederick's, he said that Donald Trump had gotten so many people involved
*  in the party on the base level that the top levels of Republican leadership needed to
*  defer to them.
*  But didn't.
*  And that they were the ones living in the past and not really dealing with the reality,
*  which is that Trumpism is the party and therefore requires being supported as the party's dominant
*  message.
*  That's what they felt was the disconnect that led to the midterms losses.
*  Was a Republican establishment that was not willing to go all in on Trump.
*  Not that Trump and those messages had caused the losses.
*  But there's another really important thing that Frederick's told me at that event.
*  People have changed.
*  And it was that this is a different type of Trump grassroots in 2023 than it was in 2022.
*  The movement has eclipsed all of its current leaders.
*  That's what you're not.
*  It's eclipsed them all.
*  This is not defined anymore by its leaders.
*  That's the most important thing to realize.
*  And the movement itself is becoming the it.
*  And that's because the Trump base, as he says, sees itself as bigger and more distinct from
*  Donald Trump as a campaign and candidate than they did before.
*  And I think this is an important point to understand, is that for a long time, we've
*  kind of thought of this as a clear causational relationship.
*  That Donald Trump and his campaign says a message and that millions of these voters
*  follow that kind of robotically respond, robotically respond to that message that he is dictating
*  the political priorities of this space.
*  But when I talked to Frederick's at the RNC event, he said that a couple of things have
*  changed.
*  One is that there have been some policy breaks between the Trump base and Donald Trump as
*  a candidate.
*  One of the things that came up at the RNC was that Donald Trump embraced the vaccines.
*  And that's something this base did not like.
*  Trump was too progressive on vaccines and COVID.
*  Not everyone's understanding of the situation.
*  And among that group, Donald Trump was too pro-vaccine and too pro-COVID mandates while
*  in office.
*  And so I think if you want to think of it as like a kind of Frankenstein figure, the
*  vaccine is a moment where they realize they get sentience, you know, that they realize
*  that there's something maybe different than the person who made them.
*  That's one break from him as a kind of political figure.
*  The other break that was really important was they were mentioning the speaker fight
*  in the House.
*  And how when Kevin McCarthy was seeking to get the gavel for the Republican majority
*  in the House, remember, Donald Trump endorsed him early, but it was a GOP base that was
*  led by Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boeber, Fox figures like Tucker Carlson at the time, who really
*  went over the recommendation of Trump to maintain distance from McCarthy and get more concessions
*  out of them.
*  And when I was asking them about this, they said that this was another moment that became
*  clear to them that they are acting in their own America first priorities, that yes, that
*  overlaps with Donald Trump, but they're not scared to go past Donald Trump.
*  They're not scared to push Trump as a candidate and campaign and that the speaker fight was
*  a proof of that.
*  And it seems like what you're describing is a moment where this is very intriguing to
*  Trump's grassroots base, this movement he's created.
*  He is starting to seem a little bit like the establishment, right?
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  I think this is, again, really critical nuance of Trump this version versus Trump previous
*  versions.
*  He's not been president for four years.
*  There's a lot of relationships that are mixed in with the GOP leadership and establishment.
*  These are all these little instances that created a distance between Donald Trump's
*  grassroots base and Donald Trump as a candidate and political figure.
*  And when we were at the RNC talking to folks in the crowd, there was a real openness to
*  seeing other candidates.
*  One person who we talked to, I remember saying, I'm for anyone who's America first.
*  They were seeing those priorities as really their political guiding light, not following
*  the specific personality of Donald Trump.
*  That's an important distinction, I think, to understand where this race started off
*  as.
*  You have a significant portion of Republicans who want a kind of America first message,
*  but that can be distinct from wanting Donald Trump.
*  And that's part of the reason DeSantis was showing a lot of real early promise in those
*  post midterm stages.
*  Okay, so at this moment, we have the grassroots unchastened by the midterm results, emboldened
*  even by them, not blaming Trump for them.
*  But we also have this group of voters saying, we're kind of bigger than Trump and potentially
*  being open to an alternative like DeSantis.
*  So what's the significance of this when it comes to understanding how the party is going
*  to handle Donald Trump going forward?
*  Right.
*  The one thing to remember about the type of people who go to the RNC winter meeting, the
*  delegates that represent the Republican Party, is that they're thinking about what's best
*  for the GOP at large.
*  And when you talk to these people, they say they have this really difficult task to navigate,
*  which is the reality that 30 to 35% of the party is unshakably with Donald Trump.
*  And they also have the reality that that is not enough people to win.
*  A general election.
*  That is not enough people to win a general election.
*  And more so than that, that the priorities of that 30 to 35% might be opposed to the
*  type of people that they need to win a general election.
*  And so when you talk to people about moving on from Donald Trump, they would hit you with
*  a kind of gut check.
*  How you doing?
*  Hey, Henry Barber.
*  Nice to meet you.
*  I'm thinking about a man we talked to whose name is Henry Barber.
*  The son of Governor Haley Barber.
*  The nephew of Governor Haley Barber.
*  It's a big family.
*  Big family.
*  I ended up becoming an RNC member in 05.
*  So pretty long time.
*  Since the middle of the George W. administration.
*  That's so many different versions of the Republican Party.
*  How have you kind of maintained RNC credibility throughout all of those changes?
*  Well, we have all kinds of incredible members on the RNC.
*  I'm more of a political hack.
*  I'm real driven by one goal for the RNC.
*  And that's winning elections.
*  That's the only statistic that matters.
*  And he was someone who is really seen as a trusted figure about how does the party win
*  elections going forward.
*  And when we posed this question to him saying, how do you deal with the reality that the
*  Trump base might be losing you elections?
*  He says very clearly that being anti-Trump is a non-starter for Republicans.
*  Anybody who has a plan and the foundation of it is anti-Trump has got not a clue.
*  Because that is a path to losing.
*  I know we need Donald Trump to be part of this, part of our success.
*  He's recognizing the reality that Donald Trump has so changed the issues that most Republican
*  voters prioritize, that there's no version of winning, particularly in a primary and
*  even in a general election that doesn't energize and activate that core base of people.
*  But at the same time, that same group of people has caused the party to drift away from the
*  type of issues that motivate swing voters, that motivate the people in the middle who
*  really rejected them in the last midterm elections.
*  I think if you look at the 22 cycle, I think there's a lesson for the 24 cycle.
*  Our candidates who were focused on the future, who were focused on public policy did much,
*  much better in the 22 cycle than the candidates who were stuck in the past.
*  And particularly those who were just talking about 2020.
*  What Barber is saying is that somehow the Republicans need to square that circle, need
*  to energize and activate the base, but at the same time, making sure that they aren't
*  pushed in directions that pull them further away from swing voters and cause them to lose.
*  To win, Barber says, you need both, not either or.
*  So I want to have that Reagan-esque leader who we nominate in 2024, who brings us together,
*  independents flock to, who moderate Democrats go, I'm voting for that guy because I want
*  the opportunity that this guy or gal are offering.
*  If that leader comes through the primary, they will fall in line.
*  Yeah.
*  And in the realities, look at 2016.
*  That's what happened with Donald Trump.
*  The party followed behind him.
*  And I think the press wonders, we all are never going to get rid of Donald Trump.
*  You're never going to move on.
*  We're not trying to get rid of Donald Trump.
*  But all we know is, is we have to move forward together if we want to win.
*  Trump can be part of this 24 victory, whether he's the nominee or not.
*  We need Donald Trump.
*  We need the people who love Donald Trump.
*  We need him to be part of the solution if we're going to win.
*  Because if we don't come together, I can assure you, we're going to have Joe Biden for four
*  more years and America ain't going to like that.
*  So rather than trying to find a way forward after these midterm losses without Trump,
*  rather than putting their fingers on the scale, maybe a little bit signaling it's time for
*  someone new, someone like DeSantis, the party's message in January is we want Trump and Trump
*  supporters to come with us on this forward looking journey.
*  And we want everyone else as well.
*  The question of course is how on earth do you do that?
*  Because the components of that are very contradictory.
*  Absolutely.
*  It was all vibes and those specifics.
*  But it said, we're still left with this really intriguing situation that I want you to resolve
*  for us, which is that this grassroots base, it's still got a kind of wary relationship
*  to Trump himself.
*  What you described earlier, suddenly this grassroots base is feeling like they don't
*  need to do exactly what Trump says.
*  So how does that factor into this moment?
*  When we were talking to Trump supporters, even at the RNC, while they weren't publicly
*  expressing any problems with Trump and were blaming the kind of Republican establishment
*  for the losses, they were privately telling us that they do believe that the version of
*  came out of the 2020 race and came into the 2022 midterms was much more focused on his
*  own personal grievances and settling the score of his own election loss rather than what
*  I think they would often refer to in shorthand as kind of 2016 version of Donald Trump, which
*  was certainly grievance driven, but representing a kind of larger community.
*  He was aggrieved on behalf of them.
*  He was aggrieved on behalf of the little guy, right?
*  And whatever you think that is.
*  Not just him.
*  Right, not just him.
*  It was manufacturing grievance.
*  It was America first in economic sense.
*  It was the wall grievance.
*  It was the wall grievance.
*  It was all of that.
*  But he was a vessel for a larger, unseen, quote unquote, forgotten American.
*  They felt that that message had gotten kind of lost from 2020 to 2022, where it became
*  about Donald Trump and his own election loss.
*  And so if they had a critique of him and how they wanted to see him shift heading into
*  2024, what we were hearing in that kind of January period was they wanted to hear him
*  back to being refocused on their grievances, not his own.
*  And so that was the kind of mandate we were hearing from Trump supporters in that early
*  period.
*  Walking past like a table full of hats.
*  Let's go Brandon, Trump won.
*  And we really see this like explicitly in early March when we go to CPAC.
*  Make America Florida.
*  Don't New York my Florida.
*  The conservative political action conference, the big grassroots gathering of right-wing
*  activists that happens outside of Washington, D.C.
*  Oh, the right stuff.
*  This is a dating app for conservatives.
*  Nice.
*  I'm sure it is popping this weekend.
*  And this is traditionally a bellwether of where the energy on the presidential race is.
*  What are you guys' names?
*  Amanda, Jeannie Sylvia.
*  When we got there and talked to voters, they were expressing similar things to what we
*  heard at the RNC winter meeting.
*  100% he needs to, we all know, focus more on what he's going to do in the future and
*  how he's going to make the country great again.
*  That they were looking to see if Donald Trump had moved past his personal grievances.
*  What do you hope he talks about?
*  The economy.
*  And when we were asking what did they want, that was really clear at the conference too.
*  Close the border.
*  I mean, and then also to get rid of this whole Russia and Ukraine war, that's just dumb.
*  This would have never happened under him.
*  A clear expression that the country is being wrested by liberal elites.
*  There's only two genders and I don't like the drag shows they're bringing their kids
*  to.
*  That's not right.
*  That's being threatened by progressive social movements like Black Lives Matter or the growth
*  of trans rights.
*  Well, I think it's disgusting actually.
*  And it's hurting our kids and now the future.
*  And so all of those became very clearly identifiable priorities for this group.
*  That they were seeking the candidate to reflect.
*  And so when you got to Trump's speech, which was the last thing to happen at that conference,
*  the question I had going into the speech is would this be a candidate that reflects those
*  priorities?
*  Would this be a candidate that understands that there is a gap, a weakness, a distance
*  between him and the base he's so associated with?
*  And would he reflect what they were asking him to do, which was close that gap?
*  Thank you very much and I'm thrilled to be back at CPAC with thousands of great and true
*  American patriots and that's what you are.
*  And I think when we heard that speech.
*  For seven years you and I have been engaged in an epic struggle to rescue our country
*  from the people who hate it and want to absolutely destroy it.
*  It was a box checking one by one of those priorities.
*  I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilization.
*  You heard Donald Trump go through the type of cultural grievances they were concerned about.
*  We will teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.
*  We will, in other words, be proud of our country again.
*  And to make clear he was the champion of their expression of America first.
*  We'll be stopping the slide into costly and never ending wars.
*  We've got to stop it.
*  Can't keep spending.
*  And when you hear those things in the context of the conference, I think it has a different resonance.
*  In 2016 I declared, I am your voice.
*  Today I add, I am your warrior.
*  I am your justice.
*  And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.
*  I am your retribution.
*  Let's take the I am your retribution line that got such national attention from that speech.
*  In isolation, you hear a candidate promising to use the powers of the federal government
*  to attack their opponents.
*  But when you're in that context, you hear a little more than that too.
*  What do you hear?
*  You hear him saying that those grievances you reflect, I understand and I will prioritize
*  when given power.
*  So it's not just a scatter shot expression from him.
*  It is a specific response to a base that was calling for him to be their vessel.
*  That's what they wanted from Donald Trump.
*  And that's what they heard at CPAC.
*  And we will make America great again.
*  So when we think about the journey we've been on that starts at the RNC with the grassroots
*  saying that they have some concerns about Trump, they have some low level wariness.
*  This is a big milestone moment in that journey because Trump is saying back to them, I've
*  heard you, I've heard your wariness, I've heard some of your concerns.
*  And he's saying, my grievances are your grievances once again.
*  I can adjust.
*  I can be this thing you need me to be.
*  And he seems like he's doing that pretty successfully.
*  Right, exactly.
*  It's that time of year again, Jim, the poll that gets it all started.
*  And this bond between candidate and base is most clearly expressed in the straw poll that
*  comes out of CPAC.
*  This is a kind of tradition that happens at this conference where they informally ask
*  the attendees who they would want their presidential nominee to be.
*  And Trump was always the favorite to win this straw poll.
*  But this year, the numbers kind of speak for themselves.
*  You saw him really clobber DeSantis.
*  62 to 20 over Ron DeSantis.
*  President Trump gets 62%.
*  And it's not as if the people there hated Ron DeSantis.
*  The people we talked to who were at CPAC frankly thought Ron DeSantis was a great governor
*  that they thought understood their grievances, but they felt that that did not add up to
*  a reason to ditch Donald Trump.
*  And I think even more importantly, that really doesn't add up to a reason to ditch Donald
*  Trump when Donald Trump is reflecting their priorities and doing so at that conference.
*  And so whereas I think after the midterms, there was even a question of just, okay, what
*  is the starting point for Trump's support?
*  I think already by early March, that curiosity was already feeling like it was starting to
*  shift.
*  That even if someone assumed that the midterms would be kind of fatal for Trump, it was not.
*  We'll be right back.
*  I said, we just talked about this idea that the Trump base, 30, 35% of the Republican
*  electorate has now been re-solidified behind Trump.
*  And that seems very much at odds with the idea that has now become conventional wisdom
*  that Trump is looking more or less inevitable to be re-nominated as a Republican presidential
*  candidate because that actually leaves a huge percentage of the Republican electorate still
*  up for grabs.
*  And I think it's because we have to understand these numbers in a more specific way.
*  When you have 30 to 35% of the Trump base, of course that leaves 65, maybe 70% of people
*  who are, we would categorize in that construction as anti-Trump.
*  When you look under the hood, that 65, 70% dislikes Trump for very different reasons.
*  They can include moderates who think that he is a kind of scary political figure from
*  an ideological perspective.
*  They include people who dislike him from a kind of personality driven perspective and
*  have no problem with how far to the right he is.
*  And so the reasons they are anti-Trump are sometimes in conflict.
*  And so the challenge for someone who is trying to put together a coalition of those people
*  is how do you cobble together a big enough percentage while at the same time uniting
*  them under one banner and under one candidate?
*  In your reporting, how have you seen this challenge of a Republican candidate trying
*  to cobble together these disparate elements of the anti-Trump coalition?
*  How have you kind of seen that play out?
*  I think this is where Ron DeSantis is a really helpful figure to look at because he is someone
*  who has done the most explicit appeals to all sides of the Republican Party.
*  We have maintained law and order.
*  We have respected our taxpayers and we reject woke ideology.
*  He has tried to appeal to the MAGA base.
*  Florida is where woke goes to die.
*  He has tried to appeal to moderates.
*  Governing is not about building a brand or talking on social media and virtue signaling.
*  It's ultimately about winning and about producing results.
*  By saying that he would not bring the drama that the Trump presidency brought.
*  I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some
*  type of alleged affair.
*  I can't speak to that.
*  The problem is that's much easier said in the abstract than in the specifics.
*  When you look at things like, for example, should a Republican nominee be supportive
*  of more aid to Ukraine?
*  That's something that really splits those group of people.
*  And you saw this really challenge Ron DeSantis.
*  He put out a statement saying he did not feel Ukraine should be a strategic priority.
*  And that got real blowback from the donor class, from candidates like Mike Pence and
*  Nikki Haley.
*  And specifically because they know that that's at odds with the type of voters on one side
*  of the ledger that he needs to get.
*  That's the challenge of the coalition building.
*  You end up pissing off one side or the other or creating openings for your opponents to
*  seize on.
*  It is why Donald Trump remains a front runner even with a minority of support.
*  It's because his 30 to 35 percent of people are ideologically homogenous and unified around
*  his message.
*  Right.
*  Because someone like Ron DeSantis, it looks so easy on paper.
*  Get 36 percent of the Republicans base.
*  But you're saying that's so much harder to do in reality because of an issue like Ukraine.
*  Which looks like it might get you X percent, but then it pisses off Y percent.
*  Maybe that just canceled itself out.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  But what about DeSantis' anti-woke campaign?
*  It's kind of the signature of the DeSantis emerging candidacy.
*  And that really did look like a very savvy place to focus.
*  It's not Ukraine.
*  It's something that many Republicans polling suggest can get behind.
*  Yeah.
*  Absolutely.
*  And this is the reason why Ron DeSantis is not one of the also rants in this race.
*  Because he has found an issue that gets a lot of Republicans on board.
*  And because he has distinguished himself from the other candidates as being someone who
*  will follow through on said priority.
*  And so when Ron DeSantis lands on his anti-wokeness campaign, he is speaking the language of this
*  Republican Party.
*  They are seeking a candidate that speaks in grievance, that speaks in retribution, that's
*  willing to use the federal government to prioritize those goals.
*  And what DeSantis' campaign does is place himself in that language.
*  And so that is the good part for Ron DeSantis.
*  Yeah.
*  What's the bad part?
*  The bad part is that that is not a message that's in conflict with Donald Trump.
*  Right?
*  It's kind of an echo.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the language of the party.
*  But it's become the language of the party because Donald Trump has largely made it so.
*  So if you're a voter whose biggest priority is grievance, right?
*  Is the way to make that most true in your next Republican nominee voting for the guy
*  who's going to attack Disney?
*  Or is the biggest sense of retribution bringing Donald Trump back?
*  Right?
*  Because ultimately Trumpism and DeSantisism can coexist.
*  Well they're just two slightly different forms of cultural conservatism and grievance, but
*  they're not so different that a Trump-based grassroots person is going to look over in
*  DeSantis and say, yeah, I need to ditch Trump for that.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  And so do some Republicans see the flaw of DeSantis is that he's just trying to defeat
*  Trump by running on the issues that Trump himself brought to the fore?
*  Yeah.
*  And this is what you have seen in reporting coming from DeSantis donors and other people
*  who have kind of made the argument that he has lost this kind of electability argument
*  to say that I would win and Trump would lose because he's playing in Donald Trump's sandbox.
*  OK.
*  So is that a candidate running for the Republican voters that don't like Trumpism and that as
*  a result is a candidate not playing in Trump's sandbox?
*  Are you saying that cultural grievances now run so deep within the Republican Party that
*  there isn't a lane for that kind of candidate who wants to focus on issues like the economy
*  and diplomacy, not trans rights?
*  That's exactly what I'm saying.
*  I'm saying literally not enough Republicans exist who prioritize those type of issues
*  for someone to run exclusively in that lane and win the nomination.
*  The party has changed in such a way that the type of people you would need to make that
*  candidate to nominee, they've become independents.
*  Some of them have become Democrats.
*  They've left the party.
*  There's just not enough of them.
*  And so there's question that keeps getting asked over and over about when do Republicans
*  turn the page on Donald Trump.
*  It is a useless question.
*  You want it banned.
*  I want it banned.
*  There is no universe where that happens, even if he loses.
*  He can lose.
*  And whoever that is, if it's Ron DeSantis or someone else, what has to bring Trumpism
*  along.
*  But don't we have to consider the possibility that Trumpism might have to go on without
*  Trump because of the legal situation that he now finds himself in?
*  We haven't talked about it that much in this episode, but he's been indicted in New York
*  over the hush money payment investigation.
*  We know that the district attorney in Georgia is talking about potentially indicting Trump
*  by the end of the summer.
*  There's a possibility Trump goes to jail in either of these cases.
*  So how does that factor into all of this?
*  And doesn't it mean that this is not just a theoretical question of Trump and Trumpism
*  needing to separate like a court and a judge might make it happen pretty soon?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  I think we definitely need to think about that possibility because it's the largest live
*  ball that's still left in the race.
*  To your point, we have the very real possibility that Donald Trump could be criminally convicted
*  as these indictments roll down.
*  And at the same time, it's really created a political problem for the race, for the
*  other candidates who are not named Donald Trump.
*  There was this kind of assumption, I think, before the race started that the legal problems
*  that Trump faced would do the work for them, would cause him to lose support among Republicans,
*  would make him too bloody and bruised to be a viable presidential candidate.
*  But what we saw after the New York criminal indictment came down was that Donald Trump
*  was raising more money.
*  Was that some level of voters were coming back to him after he was attacked, that it
*  fed into his narrative of victimhood and the idea that the federal government was trying
*  to use its powers to shut him down.
*  And so the assumption that it would fall off support from Trump just hasn't become true.
*  And I think that's particularly important for the two main candidates in this race.
*  For Ron DeSantis, there's a subtle premise to his campaign that if Trump were to not
*  be there, say, because of these legal challenges or because of a conviction, that DeSantis is
*  the natural next step for where his supporters go.
*  But the Trump campaign thinks the exact opposite effect is going to happen, that as more of
*  these indictments come down, it becomes harder to remove Donald Trump because more and more
*  Republicans will rally around him.
*  It's two different ideas and assumptions about how the legal problems and indictments can
*  scramble the race.
*  And they're all based on just best guesses.
*  Because we're in such uncharted territory, we really have no idea how this is going to
*  play out.
*  So DeSantis's position here is really interesting.
*  He might be running against Trump directly.
*  And he's also positioning himself for the possibility of running in place of Trump,
*  in which case he has to be respectful of Trump, respectful enough so that he can stand there
*  and operate as his political heir.
*  It's a legitimately difficult tightrope.
*  We should not underplay that.
*  And when you talk to Trump supporters, you see why.
*  You'll ask them about Ron DeSantis and they will say largely positive things about him,
*  that he's kind of their number two, if we can think rank choice voting style.
*  But they will also say that if someone becomes anti-Trump or if Ron DeSantis positions himself
*  as someone who's making what they would believe as liberal arguments against Trump, that would
*  make him an enemy, not an ally in the kind of overall war of Trump politics.
*  And so if you're Ron DeSantis, your kind of dream version of the race is one where you
*  are naturally handed the baton to the Trump coalition.
*  But the reality has been that core support has stuck with Donald Trump.
*  And to me, this adds up to a really important point, because what we're really talking about
*  here is what are the terms in which this presidential race will be run on?
*  I think for a lot of people, the last time they were plugged into politics was the night
*  of midterm elections where they saw a country send a unified message to both parties, to
*  reject extremism on the Republican side, to make clear that issues like election denial
*  and conspiracy were a step too far, to really ask the political system to turn the page
*  on Trumpism.
*  And I think for a lot of people, there is a uncomfortable reality that is about to hit
*  them, that that system is set to ignore that message.
*  And we are set to deal with another year and a half on the same kind of terms of Trump
*  and Trumpism, no matter who the Republican nominee is.
*  Because that is so entrenched now.
*  That's so at the core of all of our national politics.
*  And I think the big gulf between what people said they wanted in the midterms and what
*  are about to get in this presidential race is going to drive home that disconnect really
*  clearly.
*  Well, Asteb, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  You can hear all of Asteb's reporting on the 2024 presidential campaign on the Times
*  podcast, The Run Up.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Over the weekend, Russia appeared to effectively win control of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut,
*  the scene of the deadliest battle in the 15-month war.
*  If Russian troops can hold the eastern city, it would mark Russia's most successful battlefield
*  advance since last summer.
*  On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that no matter what happens to the city,
*  quote, there is nothing of Bakhmut left after months of fierce fighting there.
*  Meanwhile, in response to the newest round of U.S. sanctions against Russia, Russian
*  President Vladimir Putin has sanctioned Americans who are perceived as enemies of Donald Trump.
*  The latest evidence that Russia favors Trump over President Biden in the next U.S. election.
*  Among the 500 people that Russia sanctioned were Letitia James, the state attorney general
*  of New York who has investigated and sued Trump, Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of
*  state of Georgia, who rebuffed Trump's effort to reverse the result of the 2020 election,
*  and Lieutenant Michael Byrd, the U.S. Capitol police officer who shot a pro-Trump rioter
*  on January 6th.
