Video Description: President Trump is in the Middle East on the first major international trip of his second term. At the same time, a firestorm has erupted over his plan to accept a $400 million luxury airplane from the Qatari government.


Today, Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent, explains how the free plane may set a problematic precedent — and what Qatar might expect in return.


Guest: Maggie Haberman (https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-haberman) , a White House correspondent for The New York Times.


Background reading: 

  •  Republicans on Capitol Hill seem unlikely to challenge President Trump, as he courts gifts and pushes guardrails (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/congress-republican-reaction-trump-qatar-plane.html) .
  •  When pressed on the ethical implications of accepting a luxury jet, Mr. Trump said only someone “stupid” would turn down such an offer (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-qatar-plane-jet.html) .

# Qatar Force One
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=0.0s)]
*  President Donald Trump is in the Middle East on the first major international trip of his [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=13.84s)]
*  second term. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=17.68s)]
*  And at the same time, a firestorm has erupted over his plan to accept a $400 million luxury [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=18.68s)]
*  airplane from the Qatari government. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=25.48s)]
*  Today, my colleague Maggie Haberman explains why, to many people, this free plane is problematic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=28.48s)]
*  And it's not just because of the precedent it sets, but also what Qatar might expect [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=36.96s)]
*  in return. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=41.68s)]
*  It's Wednesday, May 14. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Donald Trump is set to accept a very pricey gift from the royal family of Qatar, taking [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=65.6s)]
*  delivery of a Boeing 747 that will be used as Air Force One during his second term. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=70.0s)]
*  President Trump says the U.S. government is poised to accept an airplane from Qatar valued [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=75.36s)]
*  at nearly $400 million. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  A super luxury Boeing jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=81.52s)]
*  The very lavish gift is raising substantial ethical and legal questions. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=85.6s)]
*  Maggie, I have been seeing all of these stories having to do something with a plane and President [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=94.72s)]
*  Trump and Qatar. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  And can you just tell us what is going on? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=102.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  So first of all, thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  It's great to be here with you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=106.39999999999999s)]
*  It is great to be here with you. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  What's going on here is that President Trump plans and has been very clear that he plans [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=108.96s)]
*  to accept a plane that he indicated is going to be donated by the Qataris for him to fly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=114.84s)]
*  around on as a new Air Force One. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=121.28s)]
*  And this is a luxury plane worth about $400 million, decked out on the interiors used [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=124.92s)]
*  by the royal family in Qatar. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=130.72s)]
*  And it has caused an enormous amount of outrage. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=133.6s)]
*  This is not just naked corruption. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=138.08s)]
*  It is also a grave national security threat. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=140.56s)]
*  Explain that outrage a little bit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=144.88s)]
*  What's the reaction been? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=145.88s)]
*  So Democrats have been very vocal that they think this is essentially some form of a payoff [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=146.88s)]
*  to the president. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=153.48s)]
*  And what people will now see is the most powerful man on earth flying around in a plane paid [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=154.88s)]
*  for by a foreign government. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  We can't have our president or anyone else being influenced by foreign government gifts. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=163.4s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=168.52s)]
*  And it's outrageous and unacceptable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=169.52s)]
*  It's wildly corrupt. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=170.96s)]
*  Because as the editorial page of the New York Post said, it's hard to imagine that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=173.0s)]
*  officials in Qatar think that they are doing this just to be nice. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=175.8s)]
*  And it's hard to know what exactly they might want in return. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=179.04s)]
*  I imagine the government of Qatar would expect a return on this investment in the president [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=182.12s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=188.68s)]
*  So this is ridiculous to think that he can take this airplane. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=189.68s)]
*  Most Republican elected officials have been pretty muted. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=193.48s)]
*  There have been a few who have commented. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=195.32s)]
*  Well, my concern is the safety of the president. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=197.2s)]
*  Qatar is not, in my opinion, a great ally. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they support Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=202.39999999999998s)]
*  It's worth the investment here in this country to build a big, beautiful general here in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=203.76s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=208.67999999999998s)]
*  But really, there has been a pretty strong reaction from some conservative Republican [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  MAGA influencers, whatever bucket you want to put them in, who are normally pretty aligned [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  with President Trump and who have said that this is not exactly draining the swamp, as [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=219.88s)]
*  he said he would. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  Taking sacks of goodies from people who support Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Jazeera, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  all the rest, that's not America First. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=228.48s)]
*  Like, please define America First in a way that says you should take sacks of cash from [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=230.64s)]
*  the Qatari Royals. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=234.76s)]
*  Basically, the people that are really concerned about this are worried that it's like a flying [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=235.76s)]
*  bribe or something. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=239.35999999999999s)]
*  A flying bribe is precisely how I think they would put it, even though I know that the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=240.35999999999999s)]
*  White House would say that that is not what it is. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=244.67999999999998s)]
*  And President Trump got very angry at the suggestion that there could be an appearance [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=247.76s)]
*  of impropriety about this. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=251.11999999999998s)]
*  He also said, Rachel, that he won't continue flying on it when he leaves office. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  And just to be clear, if this is a straight-up gift from a foreign state, is that prohibited [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=261.32s)]
*  by any rules? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=266.96s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=268.64s)]
*  A straight-up gift to an elected official by a foreign government is generally not allowed [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=271.12s)]
*  and needs to be approved by Congress. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  The way in which this might work sounds like it would be as a donation to the Defense Department, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=279.41999999999996s)]
*  which is not totally unheard of, although certainly not under this kind of circumstance. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  And then it would be donated in some way or turned over in some way to President Trump's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=288.6s)]
*  presidential library right before he leaves office. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=293.56s)]
*  But it is going to raise all kinds of questions. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=296.26000000000005s)]
*  I, unlike you, Maggie, do not know much about Air Force One. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=299.36s)]
*  In a normal world, how does a plane become an Air Force One plane? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=302.96000000000004s)]
*  In a normal world, and for a while in this world, a new Air Force One is commissioned [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  by the presidential administration by a major airplane maker. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=315.92s)]
*  It's been Boeing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=320.56s)]
*  And there is a contract that is active with Boeing for two new Air Force Ones. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=321.8s)]
*  And these planes are commissioned specifically for this purpose. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=327.84s)]
*  They get built out for this purpose, and they get fitted with certain systems that only [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=331.2s)]
*  exist for this purpose. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=334.84s)]
*  Okay, but if we already have an Air Force One, why is President Trump even entertaining [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=336.24s)]
*  the idea of getting a new Air Force One? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=341.0s)]
*  So the back story here is that Donald Trump, for starters, is very obsessed with airplanes [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=344.48s)]
*  and obsessed with the way things look. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=349.12s)]
*  This Boeing 757 is a sleek, narrow-bodied, long-legged beauty. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=350.72s)]
*  And she's treated like the celebrity who owns her. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=356.22s)]
*  This is Donald Trump's private jet, a Boeing 757. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=359.68s)]
*  And obsessed with airplanes as a status symbol. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=365.1s)]
*  That's the big thing for him. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=367.16s)]
*  One of the things very important to me on the Boeing 757 was the Rolls-Royce engines. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=369.08s)]
*  They're special. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=374.24s)]
*  He has owned planes of his own. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=375.24s)]
*  Planes outfitted with a full-bar entertainment system, iPod docking system, and how can we [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=377.2s)]
*  forget 24-karat gold trimming. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=382.32s)]
*  President Trump is flying around on two more than 30 years old, I think almost 40-year-old, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  Air Force Ones that were commissioned from Boeing a very long time ago. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=392.12s)]
*  You know, when I first came in, I said, how old is Air Force One? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=397.56s)]
*  They are not in great shape. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=401.88s)]
*  So Air Force One is a very old plane. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  It's beautiful, but it's an old 747, right? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=405.88s)]
*  They're pretty janky. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=408.52s)]
*  But it's 30 years, can you believe it? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=409.52s)]
*  So I said, so what's going on? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=412.2s)]
*  The interiors are not especially nice. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=414.36s)]
*  But no administration, Obama, Bush, they didn't want to do it because it sounds luxury. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=416.44s)]
*  But at some point, you got to buy a plane for the country. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=420.96s)]
*  I mean, they're certainly nicer than a commercial airplane, but they're not, you know, what [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=424.12s)]
*  you might see on, say, a Qatari luxury jet. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=427.84s)]
*  And these Arab countries would have their beautiful 747, 800s, 900s pour in, and they [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=431.0s)]
*  were gorgeous. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=437.36s)]
*  And believe it or not... [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=438.36s)]
*  I'm picturing like ripped cushions. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=439.36s)]
*  There's no ripped cushions, but they're... [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=441.6s)]
*  It looks like you were getting into, I'm trying to think how to describe this, if you were [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=443.84s)]
*  getting into like what was a really nice leather interior in the 1990s. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  And I'm good at airplanes, okay? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=452.56s)]
*  It looks like it is... [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=454.48s)]
*  Weathered. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=455.48s)]
*  It looks... [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=456.48s)]
*  That's a great word. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=457.48s)]
*  And the planes themselves are enormous, and they have a lot of fuel on them, so they shutter [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=458.48s)]
*  when they take off. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=462.08s)]
*  Oh, that must feel great. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=463.08s)]
*  It's wonderful, especially for those of us afraid of flying. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=464.32s)]
*  And they really like, heave to get into the air. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=466.32s)]
*  And this has always irritated Trump that this is sort of a bit of a janky plane, or [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=469.44s)]
*  two planes, that need constant servicing and are old and are not, you know, sleek and streamlined. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=474.68s)]
*  And so Trump renegotiated existing contracts that President Obama had signed, actually, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=480.0s)]
*  when President Trump was in office the first time, for two new Air Force Ones that were [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=485.52s)]
*  being commissioned by Boeing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=490.44s)]
*  And Boeing, which is making them, has obviously had all kinds of struggles. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=492.44s)]
*  And here we are now, where the planes are very delayed, and they are, as of now, still [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=497.16s)]
*  not likely to be ready while President Trump is in office, which is very irritating to [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=501.68s)]
*  him. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=504.64s)]
*  He has been very frustrated that he would not get to fly on the Air Force Ones that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=505.64s)]
*  he renegotiated contracts for last time. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=509.48s)]
*  He wanted to fly around on these new planes. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=512.24s)]
*  And so he has been looking at ways, including asking Elon Musk to help him get something [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=514.76s)]
*  done faster, where he could have a new Air Force One in the next year and a half, possibly [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=519.24s)]
*  even by the end of the year. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=524.9200000000001s)]
*  And that is how this Qatari plane was turned to as an option. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=527.52s)]
*  Why the Qataris? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=531.84s)]
*  Why this plane? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=533.16s)]
*  Why from them? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=534.16s)]
*  So Trump toured this plane in February when it was parked at the Palm Beach International [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=535.6s)]
*  Airport, and he clearly really liked it. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=540.24s)]
*  This is a plane, the Qatari plane, that has very lavish interiors, so it's really not [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=544.36s)]
*  going to require a lot of work there. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  It would obviously need some kind of equipment upgrades, and it would need to be militarized. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  And there are some security concerns here about having a Qatari plane and whether there [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=557.0s)]
*  would be any kind of a bugging or spying or so forth. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=560.44s)]
*  I know that that's a concern that a lot of officials have raised, but at the end of the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=563.6s)]
*  day, it is a much prettier plane than the ones he's flying on right now, and that's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=567.84s)]
*  why we're here. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=572.9200000000001s)]
*  I want to break down a little bit what you said about the things that need to happen [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  to the Qatari planes in order for them to become Air Force One planes. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=576.96s)]
*  So like the militarization of the planes, what does that mean? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=580.12s)]
*  So Air Force One has to be able to survive a nuclear blast. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=583.36s)]
*  It has to be able to evade certain missiles that are shot at it. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=587.5s)]
*  It has to operate as a traveling command center for a president in wartime. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=591.28s)]
*  Don't forget, President George W. Bush was famously in the air, you know, basically as [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=596.0s)]
*  a mobile White House after 9-11, and that is where he was monitoring the aftermath of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=601.52s)]
*  the attacks and he was issuing directives. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=607.12s)]
*  So Air Force One has to be equipped to do all kinds of things, and it has to have certain [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=609.56s)]
*  secure communication systems, and the hope would be to have it done by the end of the year. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=613.8s)]
*  Is that realistic? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=619.52s)]
*  A lot of defense experts have told us not really. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=621.92s)]
*  That is what they have been looking at. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=625.12s)]
*  And it seems, as of now, as if they are going to move forward. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=627.4s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  So Maggie, this proposed gift for this plane, what do we know about the terms? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=649.52s)]
*  Very little. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=668.4s)]
*  It's all notional right now because the administration has not released whatever legal analysis that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=669.4s)]
*  they say they have done. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=673.96s)]
*  But what we know of and what we're told is that Attorney General Pam Bondi, who we should [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=675.7s)]
*  note was a lobbyist for Qatar prior to becoming the Attorney General, but putting that aside, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=680.4200000000001s)]
*  she and the White House counsel, David Warrington, decided that it was legally permissible for [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=686.7s)]
*  the Defense Department to get this donated plane and then for that plane to be turned [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=692.62s)]
*  over to the Trump Library just before he leaves office. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=697.1800000000001s)]
*  The model that has been cited to us is the donation to the Reagan Presidential Library [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=701.08s)]
*  of the 707 plane that President Reagan flew around in when it was retired and decommissioned. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=707.08s)]
*  Okay, so the idea here being that the Qataris would not be donating it to him, they would [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  be donating it to the Department of Defense. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=719.24s)]
*  And then after Trump leaves office, the plane doesn't go to him, it goes to his library. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  So it's still not going to him and therefore it's more kosher? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=726.92s)]
*  Is that the idea? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=730.4799999999999s)]
*  That's the idea. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=732.52s)]
*  I mean, it seems as if based on what we've been told by the administration, they are [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=733.52s)]
*  taking two separate concepts. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=737.04s)]
*  One is that it is permissible in the past to donate an aircraft to the Department of [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=739.38s)]
*  Defense and then separately, the Reagan Library had this retired plane that President Reagan [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=743.52s)]
*  had flown around on. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=749.68s)]
*  That plane is on display at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=751.14s)]
*  I've toured it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=756.2s)]
*  It's hard to imagine that President Trump would not like to hang on to this plane for [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=757.2s)]
*  personal use himself. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=762.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=763.12s)]
*  Who wouldn't? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=764.12s)]
*  It's much nicer than his own. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=765.12s)]
*  He said on Monday that he is not going to keep flying around in it, but I know that [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=766.2800000000001s)]
*  most people who have some visibility into this process are a bit skeptical of that. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=770.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  Whether or not he actually keeps his plane for his personal use, what it seems like is [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=775.8000000000001s)]
*  that the sitting president of the US just got or will get or is negotiating to get a [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=779.96s)]
*  $400 million plane for free, a plane that the US would otherwise be paying a United [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=786.1600000000001s)]
*  States company to manufacture and retrofit. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=791.38s)]
*  It just seems like it's hard to think of this as anything other than a gift, even if they've [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=795.52s)]
*  technically donated it to the Department of Defense. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=800.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=803.1600000000001s)]
*  Look, this doesn't match any kind of Department of Defense donation that I'm aware of in the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  past. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=808.0s)]
*  I am willing to be shown wrong, but I don't know of that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=809.0s)]
*  The military would have to retrofit any plane that it acquired that was not built from scratch [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=812.76s)]
*  as an Air Force One. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=818.88s)]
*  But the bigger issue is, again, that this is the royal family of a country that ... I [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=820.76s)]
*  just want to also point out that Trump accused of sponsoring terrorism at the highest levels, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=825.0400000000001s)]
*  I think those were his words, in 2017 and encouraged a blockade of. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=830.24s)]
*  That blockade ended in 2021 just as he was leaving office, but now it is acceptable for [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=835.24s)]
*  him in his mind to accept this donation. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=839.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't know what this ends up legally looking like. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=844.68s)]
*  I do know that if President Biden had done the same thing, the outrage from Republicans [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=846.8s)]
*  would have been as loud as the outrage from Democrats is now. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=851.36s)]
*  Do we have any idea what might be in it for the Qataris to do this? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=859.0s)]
*  I mean, we don't know. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=860.0s)]
*  The president said something. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=861.0s)]
*  It was almost as if he's thinking of this as some kind of a return on investment, which [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=862.56s)]
*  was, you know, well, we provide security for them. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=866.48s)]
*  I don't think there's a mutual defense treaty, but there is a very large U.S. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=869.2399999999999s)]
*  military base in Qatar and there has been a strategic alliance. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=872.76s)]
*  OK, there shouldn't be too many questions. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=877.8s)]
*  It's been covered pretty well. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=880.12s)]
*  But that was the question he was asked by the ABC News reporter on Monday. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=881.8s)]
*  Has Qatar asked for anything in exchange for that $400 million luxury jumbo jet? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=885.52s)]
*  And how can the American people be so sure that they will not in the future? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=891.92s)]
*  She asked him, you know, can you assure the American people that Qatar is not looking [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=896.32s)]
*  for something in return? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=900.36s)]
*  And I think Qatar, who has really we've helped them a lot over the years in terms of security [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=901.6s)]
*  and safety, I feel that he didn't really answer it other than just saying, you know, they [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=909.2s)]
*  want to do this. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=913.32s)]
*  I think that was a very nice gesture. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=914.88s)]
*  Now, I could be a stupid person to say, oh, no, we don't want a free plane. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=916.5200000000001s)]
*  And that somebody would be, quote unquote, stupid to turn down such a free gift. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=921.32s)]
*  Respect, Mr. President, as a businessman, some people may look at this and say, have [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=927.36s)]
*  you ever been given a gift worth millions of dollars and then not received any money? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=931.48s)]
*  It's not a gift to me. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=935.44s)]
*  It's a gift to the Department of Defense. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=936.24s)]
*  And you should know better because you've been embarrassed enough. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=939.24s)]
*  And so has your net... [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=941.96s)]
*  What Qatar could want in exchange? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=946.1600000000001s)]
*  But I know that that question is going to come up a lot if this gift goes through. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=947.12s)]
*  I understand that we don't actually know what they want now or maybe would want in the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=951.36s)]
*  future. But could you just, Maggie, tick through the relationships between Trump world [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=954.8s)]
*  and Qatar? You mentioned Pan-Bondi. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=960.96s)]
*  Like, what else do we know? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=962.6s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=964.56s)]
*  And look, I mean, you know, there is a very long history of U.S. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=965.36s)]
*  officials, not just in the Trump administration, lobbying on behalf of Mideast countries. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=969.68s)]
*  There are, however, a lot of Qatari connections. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=974.36s)]
*  So Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, who's not in the administration now, but [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=976.56s)]
*  whose work in the past administration was beneficial to him in private business, runs [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=981.36s)]
*  an investment fund that has Saudi investments and also has Qatari investments. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=986.04s)]
*  And that's one connection. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=990.0s)]
*  Steve Woodcoff, Trump's special envoy who works a lot in the Mideast, is a private [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=991.68s)]
*  businessman with work involving Qataris. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=995.88s)]
*  The Trump company is building a golf course, I believe, in Qatar. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=998.6s)]
*  So there are a lot of entanglements. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1003.9599999999999s)]
*  There's no question. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1006.12s)]
*  Maggie, as you almost certainly know, Trump is currently in the Middle East on, I think [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1007.72s)]
*  this is his first major trip since coming back into the White House for a second term. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1012.08s)]
*  One of the stops that he's on is to Qatar. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1016.28s)]
*  And it's notable where he's not going, which is Israel, despite the fact that the biggest [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1019.0s)]
*  conflict in the Middle East is in Gaza, obviously, between Hamas and Israel. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1023.36s)]
*  What do we make of this? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1027.92s)]
*  So it's not surprising that he's going to Qatar. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1029.56s)]
*  It is a country where the U.S. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1032.28s)]
*  had been seen as an ally prior, frankly, to Trump's comments in 2017 about Qatari [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1035.08s)]
*  sponsoring terrorism. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  But the broader message of this entire enterprise that he's engaging in this week, to [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1042.9199999999998s)]
*  your question, Rachel, is there's no clear foreign policy aim for the U.S. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1048.0s)]
*  It's deals. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1052.6399999999999s)]
*  For this trip. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1053.4799999999998s)]
*  Deals, deals, deals. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1053.8799999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1054.8799999999999s)]
*  Look, when he went to Saudi Arabia in 2017, the goal was to try to minimize extremism [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1055.08s)]
*  in the region. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1061.64s)]
*  That was the stated purpose. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1062.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1063.3200000000002s)]
*  This purpose is deals. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1063.64s)]
*  And it's stated as deals for the U.S. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1065.2800000000002s)]
*  But is there an overlap now and a lot of, you know, cross currents between deals for [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1067.72s)]
*  the U.S. and deals that could be beneficial to the president? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1073.3200000000002s)]
*  Clearly. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1077.5200000000002s)]
*  So the deals, deals, deals, the deal making, what kind of deals and with whom? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1078.16s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1082.0800000000002s)]
*  So there's purported investment coming from Saudi Arabia. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  I believe that he is looking for similar investment declarations from other countries. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1086.16s)]
*  And then there are corporate leaders who all have shown up at this Saudi investment [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1091.72s)]
*  forum, some of whom have been Trump donors like Elon Musk. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1095.88s)]
*  Then there are people who Trump has spoken to frequently over the years. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1100.3600000000001s)]
*  Steve Schwartzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1103.92s)]
*  Larry Fink from BlackRock is there. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1107.8000000000002s)]
*  Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, the head of Palantir. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1110.5200000000002s)]
*  There's the head of Halliburton, the president of FIFA. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1115.0s)]
*  The head of Boeing is there as we're talking about Boeing in these airplanes. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1118.3200000000002s)]
*  And so... [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1121.52s)]
*  With the head of Boeing is there? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1122.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1123.48s)]
*  Is that kind of awkward? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1124.0s)]
*  It's well, I'm not sure what their side conversations were, but certainly the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1124.88s)]
*  backdrop of the conversation is interesting. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1128.44s)]
*  And one thing just to remember, Rachel, about the Qatari plane, the initial report [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1130.68s)]
*  was that this plane was going to be gifted to him or announced as a gift to him while [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1135.52s)]
*  he's in Qatar this week. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1140.92s)]
*  The Qatari officials after that report said that that was incorrect and that the [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1143.04s)]
*  discussions around Trump obtaining this plane were still ongoing. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1147.4s)]
*  So I got the sense just from that statement that Qatari officials don't want the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1150.44s)]
*  headline out of this week to be, we're giving you a big gift. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1157.56s)]
*  So taking all of this together, the plane deal with Qatar, the trip with all these [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1159.28s)]
*  business leaders with no clear diplomatic purpose, I can see why it all feels a [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1163.0s)]
*  little unclear as to what President Trump's primary goal is here. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1167.92s)]
*  So there's no question that there are some real deals for the country that Trump is [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1172.8s)]
*  looking to achieve here, whether it's artificial intelligence or nuclear power. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1177.64s)]
*  These are still important exercises for him as a president that could be beneficial [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1181.44s)]
*  to the U.S. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1186.64s)]
*  It is unavoidable to note that all of these discussions are in a region that is [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1187.8000000000002s)]
*  increasingly significant to the Trump family's own business interests. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1192.48s)]
*  And presidents are not subject to ethics rules the way staff are, but presidents, and [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1196.88s)]
*  they don't all succeed at this, obviously, but generally speaking, the standard that [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1203.4s)]
*  presidents have been held to is to try to avoid appearances of conflicts of interest [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1207.32s)]
*  so that voters are not raising questions about who these presidents are working on [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1213.9199999999998s)]
*  behalf of. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1218.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1219.56s)]
*  Because if this is not a bad look, then what is a bad look? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1219.76s)]
*  Trump increasingly doesn't care. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1222.24s)]
*  He's making that very clear about negative headlines. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1225.56s)]
*  Jonathan Swan and I wrote a story during the transition about how the two guardrails [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1228.4399999999998s)]
*  on him historically were the stock market and bad press coverage. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1232.24s)]
*  The stock market, he's reacted somewhat to, but negative press coverage hasn't exactly [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1237.36s)]
*  been much of a hindrance to him. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1242.6s)]
*  And he is angry that he is even being questioned about this. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1247.1599999999999s)]
*  And he is determined that he wants to get this plane, regardless of the criticism he's [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1253.6s)]
*  receiving. And so far, we have seen he is willing to dig in and ride out the storm. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1258.96s)]
*  Maggie, it's been a pleasure. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1267.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1268.6399999999999s)]
*  Rachel, thank you. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1269.84s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1280.84s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1297.32s)]
*  On Tuesday, President Trump announced that he would end sanctions on Syria. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1308.72s)]
*  The move throws an economic lifeline to a country that, until December, had been [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1314.04s)]
*  devastated by years of civil war and dictatorship under the Assad family. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1318.24s)]
*  The sanctions were imposed more than a decade ago in response to the Assad [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1323.64s)]
*  government's brutal crackdown on the country. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1327.16s)]
*  And they've been a stranglehold on Syria's economy ever since. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1329.76s)]
*  A majority of the population lives in crushing poverty. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1333.24s)]
*  The surprise announcement from President Trump came on day one of his trip to the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1337.76s)]
*  Middle East, and he's expected to meet with the new president of Syria today in [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1341.92s)]
*  Saudi Arabia. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1346.76s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson and Olivia Natt. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EACR7yWmmno&t=1347.56s)]
