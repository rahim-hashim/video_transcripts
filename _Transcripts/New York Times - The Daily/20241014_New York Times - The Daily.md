# Inside an Unprepared Secret Service
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1XjsvSjW_s)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  We gave you a heads up about this last week, but as a reminder, or in case you didn't
*  hear the episode, you might see some changes coming to the show this week.
*  If you're like most people and you listen to us on Apple Podcasts or on Spotify, you're
*  going to notice that The Times is going to ask you to subscribe if you want full access
*  to our podcasts, including The Daily.
*  As we said, every day, our newest episode, That Day Show, will remain free to everyone
*  listening everywhere.
*  And so will shows from the previous few days.
*  But if you want full access to our past shows and full access to all the New York Times
*  podcasts like Ezra Klein, Modern Love, The Run-Up, The Interview, Hard Fork, you'll
*  have to subscribe.
*  We think the easiest thing to do is to become a subscriber to all of the New York Times.
*  You get access to the newspaper, the games, the cooking app, and all of our podcasts.
*  But if you don't want to subscribe to everything, you can get just an audio subscription.
*  So even though you don't have to subscribe to hear The Daily, we genuinely hope that
*  you'll consider this a way of supporting the work that we do here and supporting the
*  journalists of the New York Times.
*  We make this show for you, our listeners, and we couldn't do it without your support.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily.
*  After the assassination attempt on former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, Congress
*  held hearings on the failures of the Secret Service.
*  What exactly do you see as the core problem that led to your agency being outgunned by
*  a 20-year-old using his father's gun and acting on his own without a particularly
*  sophisticated plan or technology?
*  They questioned the actions of the agents that day and the agency's leadership.
*  I think that we are waiting to determine exactly what those failures or failure was.
*  Director Kimberly Cheadle struggled to provide answers and soon after stepped down.
*  Weeks later, another man attempted to shoot the former president, increasing concerns
*  that something had gone very wrong at the Secret Service.
*  The focus in Washington is now on the Secret Service.
*  Does the agency need more funding or are there other shortcomings they need to address?
*  Today, my colleague Eric Lipton on why the agency's recent failures are indicative of
*  much more troubling issues.
*  It's Monday, October 14th.
*  Hi, Eric.
*  Thanks for being here.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So you have spent the last few months looking into the Secret Service and that is an agency
*  I think for a lot of Americans represents the absolute most elite group of law enforcement
*  officers.
*  But it's an agency that has come under real scrutiny after not one but two assassination
*  attempts against former President Donald Trump.
*  So just to start, can you tell us what did you know about the Secret Service when you
*  started this reporting?
*  What was your impression of them?
*  I certainly knew the pop culture image of the Secret Service, the Hollywood version
*  of these men, mostly in historically at least in their suits and the earpieces and their
*  guns who are willing to take a bullet to protect the president.
*  But I didn't actually know very much at all about the inter workings of this agency.
*  And as I started out on this, I began to wonder whether or not there were some systemic issues
*  at the agency that helped explain why there was such security failures in Butler PA on
*  July 13th.
*  So for an agency that's supposed to be so impenetrable, it seems like a monumental reporting
*  assignment to actually try to get in there and talk to people whose job is supposed to
*  be so secretive.
*  How did you go about trying to get inside and get people to talk to you about what some
*  of the problems might be?
*  It was a pretty intimidating assignment.
*  And I was sort of sitting there thinking, how am I going to get inside?
*  I started with a couple of leads from my colleagues who'd been covering the July 13th shooting
*  and they gave me the names and phone numbers of a few agents that they had interacted with.
*  And I just started with those names and I called them and began conversations.
*  These were retired agents.
*  Some of them had been out for quite a while, but it began a process of, you know, one relationship
*  led to another.
*  And it was a daisy chain of phone calls where you are building trust with each person you
*  speak with.
*  And what I found was that, in fact, even though it's the secret service, that these are people
*  that really wanted to talk and that they had a lot of admiration for the job, but at the
*  same time, a sense that they weren't sure they could really do the job because of all
*  of the challenges that they were facing.
*  And they wanted to talk about that.
*  And just to take a step back for a second, can you just describe for us what is the job?
*  What is the life cycle of a secret service agent?
*  I mean, there are a few jobs anywhere where you have to be perfect.
*  And any imperfection when it comes to protecting the president means potentially the life of
*  the president.
*  And so on any given day, there can't be even the slightest errors in that line of work.
*  And so it does attract a certain type of a person.
*  It's a very intense job.
*  And it was something that I didn't know at all before I started on the story, but they
*  have what they call phase one, phase two and phase three.
*  And in all three of the phases of their career, they are helping provide protection to, you
*  know, certain key figures in the government.
*  Phase one, they typically are assigned to a field office in, you know, St. Louis or
*  Chicago or Pittsburgh, where the Secret Service has agents that are basically investigators
*  that are looking at financial crimes.
*  And they occasionally do protective detail when the president or some dignitary comes
*  to town or provide surge capacity for special events.
*  Phase two is when they get into the security detail.
*  And this is usually like three to four or five years into their career.
*  And then they are on either the president's detail, which is the most elite, or the vice
*  president's detail, or the former president's detail.
*  They're in Chappaqua, you know, the Clintons, maybe Mar-a-Lago covering Trump, Jimmy Carter
*  even.
*  And that's phase two.
*  Phase three, they graduate to becoming a boss or they're in one of the specialized units.
*  They're overseeing the sharpshooters.
*  They're a special agent in charge of a regional office.
*  They're at the training center.
*  And so what I heard at each of the phases of their careers from these agents was that
*  at every single level, there just were not enough people to do the job that they were
*  expected.
*  And why is that?
*  Part of this is that the Secret Service in the last decade or so has been asked to cover
*  more and more government officials, protectees, they call them.
*  The number of protectees went from 26 in 2015 to 59 in 2021.
*  And that's because the president who has this authority kept adding more people to the Secret
*  Service list of those folks that they had to basically live next side to and be there
*  at any moment to make sure that they were not going to be a subject of an attack.
*  It goes back to Obama's tenure in the White House, to Valerie Jarrett, one of the top officials
*  during the Obama administration who was added to the list.
*  And then there were so many people that the agency was tasked with covering during Trump's
*  tenure, his adult children, the grandchildren and top officials that he wanted the Secret
*  Service to cover.
*  And that was just more work for these agents, even though there were not necessarily more
*  people to do the job.
*  Yeah, I remember when Trump was in office, we would frequently read all these stories
*  about how he was flying all over the world with the Secret Service and with his children
*  and staying at Trump properties.
*  And all of that seemed like, and it was reported, that it was putting a lot of strain on the
*  agency.
*  It was.
*  There was a great deal of international travel, particularly by his adult children, and they
*  were a very demanding family to follow.
*  And that put more work on the Secret Service.
*  It was perhaps the greatest demand in modern times.
*  And during Biden's administration, initially, the number of protectees went down once the
*  Trump family members came off the list.
*  But since then grew again, it's now hit 42 people that are being protected.
*  And they knew in 2023, as the 24 election was approaching that this was going to be
*  a crazy year.
*  They had a NATO summit in Washington, D.C. that was planned.
*  They had the RNC and the DNC conventions.
*  But it wasn't just increasing demand for more people to protect.
*  It also is an era of increased political violence and violent rhetoric and a sense that the
*  threat environment was much worse than it has historically been.
*  The Secret Service was very much aware of that.
*  Social media and the echo chamber of social media, it made their job much harder.
*  So you have this looming crisis, which is a shortfall of agents, the growing demands
*  of the job, the threats.
*  How does all of this actually impact the agency?
*  Well, there's a rush to make up for that shortfall.
*  And the agents who are in the field on protection duty for the president and the vice president,
*  they're stretched pretty thin.
*  So to bridge this gap, the agents are spending less time in phase one of their career and
*  they're being rushed more quickly into phase two, which is the protective work.
*  And that's when they're protecting the president or other high level dignitaries full time.
*  And not only that, agents who are helping protect the president are being asked to
*  work longer hours and they often aren't being compensated properly because the Secret Service
*  agencies have this federal salary cap.
*  And so agents at times are filing for overtime, but they aren't being paid because they've
*  hit the cap.
*  It's kind of incredible to think that the Secret Service isn't paid for their work.
*  Yeah.
*  And that leads these agents to not only be exhausted, but sort of disgusted that there
*  they are working for free.
*  And the phase in which you're on the president's detail, that's the most grueling phase of
*  an agent's career.
*  They have no control over their schedule.
*  They spend really long hours away from home and they're feeling completely burned out.
*  At our request, actually, the Law Enforcement Association that represents the Secret Service
*  agents did a survey to assess how they view the job.
*  And again and again, we found this deep frustration with just how hard they were being worked
*  in a sense that the bosses there didn't appreciate what they're being put through.
*  And one of the agents I spoke with who had been assigned to travel to Asia to help protect
*  President Trump before he left office, told me this story about how he was traveling on
*  an Air Force cargo plane and the place that he was given to sleep was underneath the chains
*  that were holding the president's bulletproof limo in place.
*  And there he was trying to sleep thinking to himself, I'm just part of the cargo here.
*  He was 54 years old.
*  He wasn't that mandatory retirement age.
*  And he just said, I'm out.
*  I'm done with this.
*  And he retired.
*  Wow.
*  And the numbers are pretty dramatic.
*  Over 1400 agents and other employees of the Secret Service left in 2022 and 2023.
*  And that's in an agency that had only approximately 7,700 people.
*  So that's a pretty huge number.
*  And what it meant was that the Secret Service was going backwards.
*  It was shrinking.
*  It wasn't getting bigger as the 2024 election year was approaching.
*  So what did the Secret Service do to try to address some of these problems?
*  I mean, they intensified their recruitment efforts.
*  They began to offer financial incentives and pay even more overtime to the remaining agents
*  and to bring back some of the agents that had retired as rehired, annuitants, they called
*  them.
*  And so those were two solutions as to how to get their numbers up.
*  That sounds on the surface, at least logical, because presumably it takes a very long time
*  to train and vet these agents.
*  So why wouldn't you just rehire people who already know how to do the job?
*  Right.
*  And it seemed like a smart plan.
*  But in fact, what they found was that they were offering agents that you could keep your
*  pension and you could come back and get paid to do the job.
*  And that was such an attractive thing that they started to incentivize people to retire
*  early.
*  So this program that was intended to get more agents into the field was actually kind of
*  backfiring and encouraging agents to retire early, it sounds like.
*  So essentially, the agency is shooting itself in the foot here.
*  Right.
*  And not only that, but once these retired agents came back, they knew a bunch of former
*  friends who were now their bosses and they were giving them desk jobs pretty far away
*  from the task of protecting the president or other protectees.
*  A number of them ended up in the field offices, like in the Miami field office, where I was
*  told that one agent saw one of these rehired Inuitants painting the wall of the Miami field
*  office and couldn't believe that this was like the highest paid painter in the United
*  States government.
*  And so they weren't actually getting much benefit from a number of these folks that
*  were coming back.
*  So Eric, you've explained all these different ways that the Secret Service has tried to
*  tackle these problems you've described.
*  But at the end of the day, they don't seem to be working.
*  That's right.
*  They were actually going backwards.
*  They were losing more people than they were hiring.
*  And the more that we dug into this, the more reporting that we did, the more that we realized
*  that the problems were much deeper than simply attrition and the inability to hire enough
*  staff.
*  That these were problems that were really fundamental to the entire agency's operations.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Eric, before the break, you said that your investigation into the Secret Service uncovered
*  an even deeper set of problems.
*  So tell us what you found.
*  A big part of this is a lack of sufficient money and clout.
*  For many years, the Secret Service was a part of the Department of Treasury.
*  And the Treasury was really the big dog.
*  It was the largest law enforcement unit.
*  But after 9-11, it was moved to the newly created Department of Homeland Security.
*  And this was a huge change.
*  Homeland Security is just this giant bureaucracy.
*  It's got Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration Enforcement, TSA.
*  It's just a giant agency.
*  And the Secret Service became sort of an afterthought.
*  And as a result, it was unable to effectively compete for the money that it needed to equip
*  and train its new hires.
*  And so what's been the result of that?
*  How has that actually hindered the agency's ability to do its job?
*  I think the biggest area that it's impacted is Secret Service training.
*  The training facility that they have in suburban Maryland outside of Washington, it's in really
*  pretty bad shape.
*  A third of the buildings there, according to a consultant's study, they concluded they
*  should just simply be demolished.
*  There's a basement room where they train new hires how to fight if they encounter an assailant.
*  And that room floods routinely when there's heavy rain.
*  The heating and air conditioning, I'm told, is pretty sporadic in some of these buildings.
*  And at one point, the plumbing went out and they had the call off training altogether.
*  And when they're training agents how to protect the president on Air Force One, they have
*  this prop that they use.
*  It's the front half of a retired plane that looks like it's from the 1960s.
*  It's sort of sad to look at this thing and think that's what they're using.
*  And when it comes to figuring out how to protect and defend the White House, they don't even
*  have a mock White House that they can train around, even though they've been talking about
*  building one for over a decade.
*  Okay, wait a second.
*  Are you telling me that some of the people that actually have to guard the White House
*  have never been inside the White House or inside anything that resembles the White House?
*  That's right.
*  That's what the Homeland Security Secretary had told us himself, that some of the uniformed
*  officers had never been inside the White House.
*  The Secret Service is so short on proper training facilities that they actually sent
*  on several occasions their personnel down to the Atlanta area to train at a mock White
*  House that Tyler Perry, the Hollywood producer, had built as a stage there in Georgia.
*  That cannot be true.
*  Yeah, it's hard to believe, but that's what the Secret Service has been left with as its
*  options for training its people.
*  I mean, back in 2014, after an assailant got over the fence and into the White House, that
*  began a conversation that they needed a proper training facility so that the uniformed officers
*  knew what the building was like, that they were being assigned to defend.
*  It's been over a decade, and still the money has not been appropriated to build this training
*  facility at their site in Maryland.
*  You've got to wonder why.
*  Why has it not gotten the money that it needs to properly train its own people?
*  So why did this get to this point?
*  How could the agency that is in charge of protecting the president end up relying on
*  Tyler Perry's White House?
*  The Secret Service acting director didn't say this, but what I heard from other agents
*  and other former bosses was that the reality is that the Department of Homeland Security
*  is fixated with the southern border.
*  When it has money, it's spending money to try to protect the border and prevent more
*  people from crossing the border and that that is the political imperative for the Department
*  of Homeland Security, not to build a training center for Secret Service agents and officers.
*  But on top of all of this, what we found is that there are even more cultural tensions
*  at the agency, particularly relating to how they hire and promote people that were causing
*  even more turmoil.
*  There is a perception that promotions are not simply based on merit at the Secret Service,
*  but too frequently it has to do with who you know.
*  And that was a source of great frustration for agents and for officers.
*  And another reason why they would say, you know what, I just want to go work somewhere
*  else.
*  For example, the guy that is in charge of the uniform division, one of the biggest parts
*  of the Secret Service, the folks that protect the White House, they also are the sharpshooters
*  that protect the president, the chief of the uniform division.
*  In addition to doing that job, he was moonlighting as a real estate agent in Maryland.
*  And his clients included officers that reported to him.
*  So he was both their boss and he was being paid as a real estate agent by them.
*  And then he was promoting some of these same people.
*  I was just startled at that.
*  I mean, it was such a conflict of interest.
*  It so undermines the whole merit promotion process that you have a financial relationship
*  with your subordinate and then you promote that person.
*  And there were people were joking to me that they figured out that the best way to get
*  a promotion was to buy a house with this chief.
*  And that was the kind of jokes that were going around at the Secret Service.
*  And as we got copies of his real estate transactions and we were able to see that there on the
*  list were several of the folks that worked for him and we were able to document that
*  this was true.
*  And we presented that information to the Secret Service and said, is this really happened?
*  Were you aware of this?
*  And for the first time, they acknowledged that they were aware of it, that they had
*  asked for an inspector general investigation.
*  But none of this was ever made public.
*  So Eric, you and our colleague, David Ferenfold have spent months reporting on this agency
*  and you've uncovered this institution that has essentially been fighting for resources
*  for years.
*  And the culture just sounds like it's broken at this point.
*  So what is the fix here?
*  For years, the culture at the Secret Service has been you ride your horse until it dies
*  and then you eat it.
*  You hear that same line from different agents there still today.
*  But in order for the Secret Service to turn this corner, it's going to have to change
*  that.
*  It's going to have to hire enough personnel so that its staff is not overworked.
*  It's going to have to bring in sufficient technology so that it can do its job with
*  the most advanced tools possible.
*  The Secret Service acting director has said that there's a new paradigm, that the agency
*  must transition and that it needs significantly more personnel and technology to do its job.
*  He's saying that as to whether or not it will get the resources and will have the leadership
*  to deliver on that is an open question.
*  Eric, you've spoken to so many agents.
*  Since the story came out, have you heard from any of them?
*  What has their reaction been?
*  Yeah, I heard from quite a number of agents that were appreciative that we put this all
*  out there on the record.
*  I think that there's a belief that if they had more personnel and better equipment, that
*  the incident in Butler would not have played out as it did.
*  The publication of our story, to some extent, was a relief to see all of these embarrassing
*  insider moments out in the open and a certain hopefulness that maybe this means that it's
*  time that they're going to be confronted.
*  But also a certain skepticism that the Secret Service is really ready to confront the changes
*  that it needs to make in order to do the job in this violent era that we now live in.
*  Well, Eric, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  On Saturday, a man was arrested and accused of illegal weapons possession as he was trying
*  to enter a Trump rally in Coachella, California.
*  The man, identified by local law enforcement as Vem Miller of Nevada, had gotten through
*  an outer ring of security as he drove in.
*  He was eventually stopped by police before President Donald Trump arrived and was later
*  released on bail.
*  Reached by the Southern California News Group on Sunday, Miller identified himself as a
*  Trump supporter and said that he was shocked at the arrest.
*  In a joint statement with the U.S.
*  Attorney's Office and the FBI, the Secret Service said it had determined that the incident
*  did not impact protective operations and that the former president was, quote, not in any
*  danger.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Sunday, the United States military said it's sending an advanced missile defense
*  system to Israel, along with about 100 American troops to operate it.
*  This is the first deployment of U.S.
*  forces to Israel since the October 7 attacks.
*  The system will help defend Israel from ballistic missiles, like the ones Iran fired at it
*  on October 1st.
*  And early Sunday morning, SpaceX landed a rocket booster back onto its own launch site
*  in Texas, a technical feat that brings the company one step closer to founder Elon Musk's
*  ambitious plan to make completely reusable space rockets.
*  We are go for catch.
*  As it fell out of the sky at supersonic speeds, the returning rocket booster set off sonic
*  booms before returning to its platform on Earth.
*  NASA hopes to use a SpaceX rocket during two upcoming missions that will take astronauts
*  to the moon.
