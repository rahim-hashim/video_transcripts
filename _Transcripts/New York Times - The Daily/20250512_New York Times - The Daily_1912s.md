# A Vulnerable China Comes to the Table
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroef. This is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Over the weekend, the U.S. and China met for the first time since President Trump rapidly [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  escalated a trade war between the world's two economic superpowers. The negotiations [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=18.26s)]
*  could have huge implications for a global economy rocked by Trump's tariffs. Today, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=24.36s)]
*  my colleague, Beijing Bureau Chief Keith Bradshaw, on the pressures facing China as it came to [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=30.64s)]
*  the negotiating table and why it so badly needs a deal. It's Monday, May 12th. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=35.88s)]
*  Keith, it's nice to have you back on the show. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=63.0s)]
*  Thank you, Natalie. Good to be back. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=65.4s)]
*  So we on the show have talked quite a bit about the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=68.08s)]
*  We've talked less about the impact of tariffs on China's economy. And as we enter what [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=73.56s)]
*  seems like potentially a new phase in this trade war where the two sides are talking [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=79.2s)]
*  to one another, it seems important to understand something you've been reporting on, Keith, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=84.16s)]
*  which is that the tariffs present a real nightmare scenario for China. Tell me about that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=89.4s)]
*  President Trump, by early April, had raised tariffs on goods from China to 145 percent. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=95.72s)]
*  That stopped all but the most essential imports coming in. Why was this terrible timing for [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=104.04s)]
*  this to happen to China right now? It was because China is already struggling with several [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  severe economic problems. The biggest of them is the housing market crisis. Apartment [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=119.26s)]
*  prices have plummeted 30, 40, in some cases, some cities, 50 percent drops in apartment [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  prices since the high of the bubble in 2021. So this has been a huge blow to the household [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=134.70000000000002s)]
*  finances of people in China. In turn, they've stopped spending money on consumer goods and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=142.26s)]
*  the tax revenues of the Chinese government are also way down. So they've got a huge budget [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=148.9s)]
*  problem. So when you've got a property crisis and an emerging budget near crisis, that's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=153.06s)]
*  a very bad time to have a trade war. It's interesting. I think that analysis, that reality [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=161.88s)]
*  is going to come potentially as a real surprise to a lot of our listeners, because the last [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=168.58s)]
*  time we had you on the show, we were talking about what a powerhouse China was, what an [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=173.46s)]
*  exporting superpower this country had become. And what you're saying is that domestically, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=178.46s)]
*  the economy doesn't actually look quite that strong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=185.86s)]
*  That's exactly right. This is an economy built for exports, built for manufacturing dominance, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  built for maximizing production. But it's not a good economy at consuming. It's not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=198.86s)]
*  a good economy at having a population that is able, willing, eager, even like many Americans [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=207.46s)]
*  to spend money and have a better life. So what ends up happening when you have this [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=216.38s)]
*  enormous excess of production, it has to be exported or the whole system gets in bigger [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=223.82s)]
*  trouble. Basically, China over the last four years has made an enormous bet that it can [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=230.18s)]
*  dominate world markets in practically everything for manufactured goods. That only works as [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=239.1s)]
*  a strategy if you can export. So that is why even though the Chinese economy now leads [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  the world in installations of new factory robots, leads the world in the quality of [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=254.0s)]
*  the infrastructure, it leads the world in many categories of economic strength, but [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=260.72s)]
*  it has an enormous dependence on exports. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=266.72s)]
*  Right. 145% tariffs slapped on your goods by the world's largest consumer economy will [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=269.56s)]
*  make a bet on exports look a little risky, especially if your people aren't buying things. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=276.0s)]
*  So let's get into that, Keith. Why is that? Why is China not a good economy for consumption, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=283.08s)]
*  as you put it? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=289.4s)]
*  For starters, China has a tax system that is based heavily on taxing consumption, not [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=290.8s)]
*  so much on taxing income. The burden instead hits you when you try to buy anything. So [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=298.12s)]
*  national value added tax. It's like a kind of sales tax that is twice as high as the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=306.92s)]
*  typical sales tax in the United States and covers practically everything. Whether you [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=316.0s)]
*  want to buy a car, whether you want to buy a washing machine, or even there's a heavy [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=323.52s)]
*  tax on paying your rent. Wow. So these high consumer taxes are discouraging people from [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=328.8s)]
*  spending money. But this is not just about taxes. Even more important is that China has [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  a very modest threadbare social safety net. The pensions, the equivalent of social security [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=342.78s)]
*  in the United States are tiny. The unemployment insurance is very modest and a lot of people [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=350.38s)]
*  don't qualify and they actually cut back further the number of people who qualified the moment [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=357.7s)]
*  the COVID pandemic ended to make sure that they went back to work immediately. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=363.18s)]
*  It's a little confusing, Keith. This is the Communist Party of China, right? I mean, no [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=368.58s)]
*  welfare programs, no social safety net. How do you square that? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=376.26s)]
*  Not much of a social safety net. There was actually even a discussion 25 years ago in [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=381.06s)]
*  the Communist Party of China on whether to drop the word communist and they decided to [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=386.18s)]
*  keep it. They decided it had a lot of historical resonance for them. But this is really a very [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=390.86s)]
*  strongly capitalist system now. For example, when I mentioned to people in China that there [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=397.66s)]
*  is rent control in some American cities, they are stunned. The idea that any government [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=403.74s)]
*  agency would tell somebody who owns an apartment how much they can charge to rent that apartment [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=410.18s)]
*  out is startling to them. And they say that's socialism, somewhat jokingly to me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=415.5s)]
*  The Chinese calling the American socialist is just wild to imagine. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=421.66s)]
*  And yet it's really the sentiment. That's exactly right. Xi Jinping has denounced what he calls [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=427.78s)]
*  welfareism, which he says might erode the work ethic of the Chinese people. What he said in a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=433.86s)]
*  speech four years ago was, quote, even in the future, when we have reached a higher level of [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=440.94s)]
*  development, and are equipped with more substantial financial resources, we still must not aim too [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=446.82s)]
*  high or go overboard with social security and steer clear of the idleness breeding trap of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=454.06s)]
*  welfareism. Whoa. And because there is very little in the way of a social safety net, people in [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=461.65999999999997s)]
*  China save a lot. In fact, they save more than anyone else in the world. The savings rate is [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=467.3s)]
*  around 40%, saving two out of every $5 of their paychecks. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=474.14s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  That is a tremendous amount. In the United States is 4% or less. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  So the Chinese are just saving a ton in part because there's just very little social safety net. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=484.94s)]
*  And they're not spending that much in part because of these really high sales taxes. What are they [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=490.98s)]
*  doing with all the money they put away? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=497.22s)]
*  Well, people in China really don't have as many options as savers in most of the rest of the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=500.3s)]
*  world. The stock market is very risky and full of dodgy companies. The Chinese government puts very [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=506.34000000000003s)]
*  stringent limits on their ability to invest outside of China. And so the alternative has been real [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=514.22s)]
*  estate. The result was that people in China put far, far more of their savings into real estate [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=522.18s)]
*  than in most countries. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=529.8599999999999s)]
*  Okay, here's where housing comes in. You mentioned there was this huge housing crisis. Where does [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=531.7399999999999s)]
*  that story start? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=537.62s)]
*  If you went all the way back to the 1980s, people in China were living in very small apartments. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=539.7399999999999s)]
*  Typically, there was a tremendous shortage of housing. Starting in 1987, China began experimenting [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  on transferring land to private developers and having them begin to build apartment buildings and [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=554.06s)]
*  sell them to the public. And then in 1998, the government transferred millions of apartments from [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=561.14s)]
*  state-owned enterprises and local governments to the people who were living in them for almost [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=569.4599999999999s)]
*  nothing. That created a very large market. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=573.26s)]
*  And so then by the early 2000s, you had a completely new housing market like nobody had seen [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=577.9s)]
*  before. The local governments were selling enormous amounts of land each year to developers. And the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=584.98s)]
*  revenues from that were immense. And that was what paid for the terrific roads, bridges, highways, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=592.1s)]
*  high-speed rail, ports. And the developers were putting up 30-story apartment buildings as far as [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=599.82s)]
*  the eye could see. Hundreds of millions of people benefited greatly. The number of square feet per [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=606.38s)]
*  person in apartments in Chinese cities quadrupled. All of a sudden, you didn't have to have three [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=613.1s)]
*  generations crammed into a small apartment. But after meeting a lot of those housing needs, this [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=620.82s)]
*  turned into a speculative mania that got out of control. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=632.7s)]
*  How so? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=636.74s)]
*  I'll give you an example. I know a sales manager at a small furniture factory who, even though she [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=637.7800000000001s)]
*  earns a modest salary, has ended up buying five apartments. How do you end up with five apartments, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=644.9s)]
*  I asked her when I first met her, on a small salary? And the answer was she'd bought one, it went up. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=651.98s)]
*  She sold it and bought two. They went up. She sold one of them, bought two. Little by little, she [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=660.22s)]
*  ended up with five apartments, all of them with mortgages. So I said to her, what is going to [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=666.54s)]
*  happen if apartment prices go down? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=672.3s)]
*  And what did she say? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=675.74s)]
*  She said, I don't have to worry about that. The price will always go up. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=677.06s)]
*  Wow. That's a bet. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=680.78s)]
*  Well, it was a bet that worked. From the late 1980s, the price always went up. The final skyward [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=682.62s)]
*  jump in real estate prices began in 2016. The banks in China were told by the government, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=692.1s)]
*  essentially, give a mortgage to practically anybody with a pulse. We're doubling down on [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=700.26s)]
*  construction. We want everybody buying apartments. And the housing market just went nuts. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=704.3000000000001s)]
*  It sounds like people poured their money into the real estate market because it was really the only [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=717.46s)]
*  option they had to get a return. And the government is making it a lot easier to get a loan. And that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=722.86s)]
*  creates this bubble, this classic real estate bubble. So when does that bubble burst? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=729.74s)]
*  It began to burst in 2020 and 2021, when stricter rules started to be put on these real estate [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=737.9s)]
*  developers who were taking big deposits from many families and using that money not to build the [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=745.9s)]
*  building that they promised for the deposits, but to finish the previous building they promised [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=752.1s)]
*  somebody else. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=755.9s)]
*  It was becoming in some ways even a Ponzi scheme. The government finally got concerned about this. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=756.66s)]
*  It began imposing tighter and tighter borrowing and spending rules on the developers. And by the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=763.02s)]
*  second half of 2021, real estate prices were falling quickly and many of the real estate [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=769.74s)]
*  developers were starting to collapse. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=775.6999999999999s)]
*  The real estate collapse has been devastating for families across China. In fact, people don't [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=777.34s)]
*  even really want to talk about it. It's so painful for them. Chinese families had twice as large a [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=782.62s)]
*  share of their household net worth in real estate as in the United States. So they were really [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=789.7800000000001s)]
*  heavily, heavily invested. They didn't have much else. It was all in apartments. And they were [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=796.62s)]
*  really heavily, heavily invested. They didn't have much else. It was all in apartments. And then the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=802.5s)]
*  apartment prices have gone down faster in China than they did in the United States during the 2008 [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=809.1s)]
*  to 2009 real estate crash. So the total losses on apartment value in China are now twice as big as [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=815.74s)]
*  they were in the United States in 2008, 2009. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=824.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=828.58s)]
*  And this is coming out of the savings of a country that's not as prosperous as the United States. So [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=829.1400000000001s)]
*  to lose twice as much of your savings is just devastating. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=834.9000000000001s)]
*  It's amazing to think, Keith, that this had an even more damaging effect than the US housing crisis [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=838.82s)]
*  did in America. I mean, we think of that as one of the worst moments economically in this country in [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=855.9000000000001s)]
*  recent history. What's the government's response in China? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=862.1s)]
*  The government's response has been to shift the priority of government lending away from real [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=867.62s)]
*  estate and towards building lots of factories. The government's goal is to create a lot more jobs, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=875.3000000000001s)]
*  which they want to offset the loss of jobs in the construction sector. And their hope is that if [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=883.54s)]
*  people have well paid jobs in the factories, they will begin to have the confidence to spend again. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=890.58s)]
*  And does it work? I mean, do the factory jobs make up for all the losses in the housing sector? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=897.42s)]
*  The very, very heavy lending by the state controlled banking system to build more factories and other [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=904.58s)]
*  industrial sites has helped some. A minority of all workers in China are factory and other [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=911.34s)]
*  industrial workers, and they have benefited. But for the rest of the country, they're not benefiting. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=920.74s)]
*  The demand is weak. If you go to hotels, the hotels are mostly empty, the restaurants are closing. So [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=928.1400000000001s)]
*  workers across the rest of the economy aren't doing very well out of all of this. And so the Chinese [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=936.7s)]
*  government strategy has been to double down on building even more factories for exports. And many [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=942.14s)]
*  of these factories have not yet been finished. In many ways, it looks as though they have replaced a [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=951.02s)]
*  housing bubble with a factory bubble. Wow. China is now trying to save itself trying to save its [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=960.02s)]
*  economy by ramping up exports to the rest of the world. And that has real consequences for any other [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=968.7s)]
*  country with a manufacturing sector, whether it's Brazil or Mexico or Germany or Japan or South Korea, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=978.26s)]
*  or the United States. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=985.1400000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=999.1s)]
*  Keith, the impression that I'm left with is that as these Trump officials met with their Chinese [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1006.22s)]
*  counterparts this weekend, they confronted an adversary that was actually quite vulnerable, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1011.1s)]
*  facing a lot of pressures of its own internally. So take me through a little bit what China had done [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1016.62s)]
*  up until this weekend to at least try to mitigate some of the damage of Trump's tariffs. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1023.7s)]
*  China has taken a lot of little actions. But the steps they've done haven't really fundamentally [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1029.9s)]
*  changed the situation. I'll give you some examples. They've cut interest rates a little bit. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1037.14s)]
*  They've given the banks the freedom to lend more. But that doesn't make such a big difference when [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1042.26s)]
*  many companies are so worried about where they're going to be able to sell their products. Not in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1049.62s)]
*  China, where consumption is weak, and now not in the United States with the tariffs. The Chinese [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1055.9399999999998s)]
*  government is doing a little bit to strengthen the threadbare unemployment insurance scheme. But many, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1061.54s)]
*  many factory workers don't qualify for that at all. So that doesn't really solve the problem either. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1068.6999999999998s)]
*  What you have not seen is a broad consumer stimulus program like we saw, for example, in the United [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1073.66s)]
*  States during the COVID pandemic, when the United States sent checks out to everybody. And that's [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1081.26s)]
*  because the Chinese government to some extent doesn't have the money. It's really facing very [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1086.62s)]
*  weak tax revenues. So all of these steps haven't been the really big measures that would move the [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1092.46s)]
*  needle at a time when the key engine of China's growth, exports plus construction of factories to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1100.62s)]
*  produce those exports is under threat. What about China's direct response to the United States, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1108.2199999999998s)]
*  the actions it's taken targeting the US economy? What do you make of those? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1115.7399999999998s)]
*  China has put tariffs of 125% on American goods since mid-April. But the United States doesn't sell [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1121.5s)]
*  that much to China. That's one of the reasons there's such a big trade imbalance. China has [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1132.8600000000001s)]
*  tried even harder to switch purchases of agricultural goods, like soybeans, to other [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1139.74s)]
*  countries like Brazil. But to some extent, that means American farmers just shipped to [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1147.02s)]
*  the other countries that Brazil used to supply instead of shipping to China. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1153.74s)]
*  The most important step by far that China has made that could really create problems [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1158.46s)]
*  for a wide range of American manufacturers, from aircraft manufacturers like Boeing to [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1165.82s)]
*  defense contractors like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin to automakers like General Motors and Ford, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1172.14s)]
*  is to halt the export of rare earth magnets. That has already become a significant problem [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1179.5s)]
*  for many American companies, and for that matter, even for European companies. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1188.6200000000001s)]
*  But there are also big risks for China. The risk is that these big companies will decide [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1192.5400000000002s)]
*  that they can't trust China to be providing key components. That's the kind of disruption that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1199.98s)]
*  complicated assembly plants in the West can't really handle. If corporate boardrooms react [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1207.18s)]
*  to this interruption in rare earth magnet supplies by saying, we're not going to buy from China [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1214.3s)]
*  anymore, that would be a disaster for China and a disaster for the Chinese families that depend on [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1220.78s)]
*  working in factories, making these components to earn their livelihoods. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1227.34s)]
*  Right. It sounds like there's these limits or potential obstacles to many of China's retaliatory [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1231.34s)]
*  measures here. I'm wondering, what about China turning around and selling to the EU, the world's [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1238.22s)]
*  other real major consumer economy? The US is an important, perhaps the important consumer, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1245.58s)]
*  but it is just one country. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1253.26s)]
*  But it is just one country. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1254.9399999999998s)]
*  That's true. The difficulty for China is that the European Union has been increasingly worried [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1257.1799999999998s)]
*  about the tsunami of goods coming out of China and has been moving to impose its own tariffs [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1265.6599999999999s)]
*  on those goods. You've seen that most noticeably already with Europe imposing tariffs on electric [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1272.9399999999998s)]
*  cars from China. And there is really an international move to raise tariffs on goods [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1281.42s)]
*  from China by countries that have industrial sectors and worry about becoming entirely reliant [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1288.7s)]
*  on China. So Brazil, Turkey, India, as well as the European Union have all moved to raise their [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1294.78s)]
*  tariffs. They just haven't done it in quite such an in your face style as Trump has. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1301.98s)]
*  Yes. Right. These countries agree with some of the premise, if not the execution of these Trump [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1308.06s)]
*  tariffs. And it sounds like that may contribute to the bind that China could face, where it could [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1316.1399999999999s)]
*  become really difficult to avoid the pain of these tariffs. And so can you help me understand what [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1324.3s)]
*  that looks like, Keith, what that pain means both for the Chinese government and for the Chinese [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1331.6599999999999s)]
*  people? What I've already seen on the ground, for example, in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1337.26s)]
*  southeastern China, is that some factories are already closing and the longer tariffs continue, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1342.06s)]
*  particularly if they were to continue at high levels, the more factory closings, the more layoffs [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1349.9s)]
*  you would see. So China has a big economic incentive to reach some kind of resolution, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1358.6200000000001s)]
*  longer term resolution, longer term closure on this issue. However, while China may be experiencing [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1367.5800000000002s)]
*  more pain in the United States, China also has more ability to endure pain than the United States. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1374.38s)]
*  How do you mean? Well, China has a very stringent security apparatus that has crushed descent [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1382.38s)]
*  already in many ways. If you had these kinds of layoffs in other countries in the West, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1390.94s)]
*  you would have large scale protests by workers and in particular by labor unions. China has no [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1397.0200000000002s)]
*  independent labor unions. China is quick to detain any workers who try to organize any independent [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1403.8200000000002s)]
*  protests. China heavily, heavily censor social media and blocks access to overseas websites so [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1411.82s)]
*  as to keep a very tight grip on the information that most people in China are able to access. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1421.74s)]
*  And it tamps down or silences any discussion of job losses and economic pain and presents the [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1429.34s)]
*  whole dispute with the United States and with the world in very nationalistic terms. So through this [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1438.3000000000002s)]
*  spring, what we've seen has been rhetoric from China about how it would not bow down to or kneel [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1448.38s)]
*  before the United States. But China nonetheless decided to go ahead with the talks this past [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1455.42s)]
*  weekend, even though previously it had said it wouldn't even talk to the United States [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1464.46s)]
*  unless the tariffs were removed first. Right. I wanted to ask you about that, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1471.34s)]
*  Keith, because I hear you that while this pain is there, Beijing is doing everything possible to [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1475.9s)]
*  hide it from the world, to hide it from its own people. But the pain still exists, right? And I [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1482.06s)]
*  have to imagine that those dynamics are part of what potentially pushed China to the negotiating [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1488.94s)]
*  table this weekend. It's clear that they are highly aware of what the populace is experiencing [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1497.74s)]
*  on a day to day level. They keep extraordinarily detailed information on, for example, how many [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1506.46s)]
*  people are going home from the factories and not coming back into the cities. And the last thing [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1513.9s)]
*  that China wants is for a repeat of the kind of public protests by workers and others that you saw [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1519.98s)]
*  in late 2022 against the COVID zero policies. Now, if anything, many people in China have even more [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1528.14s)]
*  to be upset about because they've lost much or all of their life savings in the bursting of the [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1534.7800000000002s)]
*  housing bubble. And now they have faced through this spring job losses as exports declined to the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1542.7s)]
*  main buyer of Chinese goods. Purchases by the United States have been what have really kept the [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1551.3400000000001s)]
*  Chinese economy going for the last several years through this housing bust. And the tariffs [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1559.1000000000001s)]
*  affected the extent to which that gravy train could continue for China. And so this has been [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1567.1000000000001s)]
*  a genuine worry for the Chinese leadership. So as these negotiations progress, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1574.6200000000001s)]
*  what do you think is the best case and worst case scenario? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1582.38s)]
*  Best case or worst case for whom? Well, I'm wondering actually whether there is a best [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1586.38s)]
*  and worst case for both sides. Is there a compromise here that could work? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1591.82s)]
*  There are partial compromises that would work. For example, some reduction in tariffs makes sense [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1598.86s)]
*  for both countries because the tariffs right now are so high that they're almost at trade embargo [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1609.98s)]
*  levels. But the difficulty is that the two sides have fundamentally different interests [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1616.22s)]
*  that are very hard to reconcile. The United States is saying that it refuses to be the main market [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1623.82s)]
*  for ever rising Chinese exports and would like to strengthen what's left of its industrial base [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1637.02s)]
*  and become a little bit more self-reliant or at least reliant on countries other than China, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1646.54s)]
*  countries that are not engaged in big military buildups aimed at the United States. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1654.06s)]
*  On the other hand, China has a very strong desire and interest in ever rising exports. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1663.98s)]
*  China didn't spend $1.9 trillion extra over the last four years on factory construction, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1673.82s)]
*  factory robots, other automation, and so forth for nothing. They did that because they wanted to be [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1685.26s)]
*  able to sell all the goods coming out of these newly built factories that I see everywhere all [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1692.3799999999999s)]
*  the time as I travel around China. To be as dominant as possible. They want to dominate as [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbSizmjTSWQ&t=1696.7s)]
