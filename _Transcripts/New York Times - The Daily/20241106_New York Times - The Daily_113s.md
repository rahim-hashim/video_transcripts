# Donald Trump's Plan to Reinvent Democracy
**New York Times - The Daily:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04)
*  But let's just review a couple of the things that Donald Trump has said in this campaign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=0.0s)]
*  and that those around him have said about what he will do. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=5.88s)]
*  Expanding presidential power by bringing independent agencies like the Fed directly under the thumb [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=9.64s)]
*  of the president. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Using the Department of Justice to prosecute his enemies and ensuring that no one within [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=16.84s)]
*  the executive branch will stand in his way, that there will be no one there to object. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=22.92s)]
*  Others in giving Trump a second term, you can argue have endorsed a fundamentally different [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=29.16s)]
*  vision of the presidency and democracy itself. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=36.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can argue that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=40.92s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a, I'm like wrestling here because I think there's also a simple [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=42.72s)]
*  story here too. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=46.56s)]
*  Like inflation is high, the administration is unpopular and throughout the world, the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  developed world, we've been seeing incumbent governments lose because of basically those [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=54.8s)]
*  two reasons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=58.66s)]
*  And so I don't think that there's a complicated story about like Trump and his policies and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=59.66s)]
*  what he's promised, but there's also a simple one that says folks don't like the country [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=64.3s)]
*  as it is now and we're willing to roll a dice on what it could be under him. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=68.82s)]
*  Now I think to your point is an important one though, because at this table last week, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=73.02s)]
*  we talked about democracy and how Democrats don't offer an alternative vision about improving [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=77.78s)]
*  it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=84.14s)]
*  And I think that if we lay out the ways that Donald Trump has undoubtedly promised a reshaped [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=85.14s)]
*  federal government that is in line with his, you know, praise of authoritarians across [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=91.34s)]
*  the world, I think we should also say that like the response to that has just been to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=97.5s)]
*  say that is wrong and not to say that there are fundamental concerns people have about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=103.34s)]
*  the way government is working and what Democrats could do to improve it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=364ypt5HJ04&t=109.82s)]
