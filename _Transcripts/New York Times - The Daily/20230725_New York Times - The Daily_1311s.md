# Russiaâ€™s Newest Target: The Global Food Supply
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EChj7FCWbkM)
*  From The New York Times, I'm Matina Steves-Gridnev.
*  In for Sabrina.
*  And this is The Daily.
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine put the global food supply at risk until the two countries
*  struck an unusual deal to keep food shipments flowing.
*  Last week, that deal fell apart.
*  Today, my colleague Mark Santora on what the collapse of the deal means for the war and
*  why its impact will be felt by tens of millions of people across the world.
*  It's Tuesday, July 25th.
*  Mark, tell me about this deal that fell apart last week and why it's so significant.
*  Very simply, Matina, it's about feeding the world.
*  Between the two of them, Russia and Ukraine provide just a ton of the world's food supply.
*  Russia and Ukraine produce about 30% of the world's wheat and barley.
*  20% of corn comes from Russia and the Ukraine.
*  Ukraine is one of the world's leading suppliers of grain, barley, rapeseed oil, sunflower
*  seeds and a host of other products.
*  Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended the flow of food around the world.
*  But the moment Russia launched its full-scale invasion, it also instituted a naval blockade
*  on all of Ukraine's Black Sea ports.
*  They laid sea mines trapping the ships that were meant to deliver millions of tons of
*  grain to the global market.
*  Around 25 million tons of grain are stuck in the country.
*  Some of it is stored in silos like these in the port of Odessa, waiting for export.
*  So all of that just went off the market overnight.
*  The food supply for millions of Ukrainians and millions more around the world has quite
*  literally been held hostage by the Russian military.
*  For Russia's part, they're the global leader in exporting fertilizer around the world.
*  The war starts and the exporting of that fertilizer becomes incredibly more difficult for Russia
*  because of the sanctions that are put on them.
*  So you have a situation where crops are stuck in Ukraine and the stuff that helps those
*  crops grow is harder to move out of Russia and food prices soar.
*  So when it became clear that this war was not going to be a quick war but a lasting
*  war, international pressure began to build to try and find some sort of solution.
*  Right.
*  And that solution is an agreement to restart food shipments.
*  So how does that come together?
*  So in April of last year, Ukraine and Russia agreed to begin to talk about this growing
*  problem.
*  They won't do it with each other, but they agreed to start discussing ways to possibly
*  find a solution.
*  And they do that in Turkey.
*  And Turkey's central role in all this makes sense just even if you look at the map.
*  Turkey controls the only way in and out of the Black Sea where all these ships from Ukraine
*  would have to go through, right?
*  That's right, Matina.
*  They are the ones who determine what ships can pass through civilian cargo vessels and
*  others.
*  And so in order for any ship to get safe passage, the first step is for Turkey to grant passage
*  into the Black Sea.
*  And here you have the situation where the Turkish leader, President Erdogan, who has
*  relationships both with Moscow and with Ukraine, with the West and with the East, tries to
*  position himself as sort of the mediator here, the person who can find the solution to one
*  deepest and most complex global problems that arose from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  Well, I remember covering these talks in Istanbul and just felt like a bit of a mission impossible
*  to get Russia to back off and agree to anything.
*  But I remember thinking maybe Erdogan, maybe the Turkish president would be able to pull
*  it off.
*  Yeah, amazingly, he does.
*  And I think, you know, when the parties were actually finally brought together to sign
*  this agreement, the depth of the division and the challenges in making it happen were
*  evident in the signing ceremony itself.
*  Today, there is a beacon on the Black Sea, a beacon of hope, a beacon of possibility,
*  a beacon of relief.
*  They had a grand table laid out with flowers and all the usual statecraft that goes into
*  the signing of a treaty where you'd have two parties come together and sign a document.
*  In this case, the Russians came out first, onto the stage, signed it and then left.
*  The Ukrainians separately came out and they signed and they left.
*  Never at any point did Russia and Ukraine make a deal together.
*  Rather, what they had was a deal through Turkey and the United Nations to get the grain moving
*  again.
*  The signature ceremony has ended.
*  Thank you.
*  Right, I remember watching that moment and it was just so fragile, so delicate and you
*  could really see that in the careful choreography of making sure that the two officials would
*  never actually be on stage at the same time.
*  You have to remember the emotions too here.
*  The atrocities in Butch had come to light.
*  You had Russia raining missiles down on towns and cities across the country, occupying something
*  like 25% of the land.
*  It's incredible that they were able to find some way forward on this.
*  Let's walk through exactly what was in that deal.
*  What did each side agree to?
*  So Matina, the deal basically has two parts.
*  First you have the UN promising that it's going to help Russia get better and cheaper
*  terms to let it export its own fertilizer.
*  Essentially, it's the UN saying that it's going to help ease sanctions put on Moscow
*  for launching its invasion of Ukraine.
*  In exchange, Russia says it'll grant safe passage for cargo ships through the Black
*  Sea, helping them navigate a maze of maritime mines and also pass its own warships to bring
*  the grain out of Ukraine.
*  And then to be sure the ships aren't smuggling goods or ammunition or other things, there
*  will be an inspection center set up in Istanbul with people from both Ukraine and Russia who
*  can inspect the ships as they leave.
*  So Russian officials and Ukrainian officials are going to be working together in this small
*  space in Istanbul to get the grain ships moving again.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, even though the deal itself isn't between Russia and Ukraine, you have a situation
*  where you have the two parties basically operating in this little joint center to try and get
*  this grain onto the market again.
*  And the place we're going to see if this deal is going to work and the most important place
*  for it to succeed is in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa.
*  And why is Odessa so important?
*  So Odessa has economic, militarily strategic and symbolic importance.
*  First of all, it's the largest port in Ukraine and it's sort of a remarkable sight to see.
*  Cranes rising high in the sky, dozens and dozens of them, train lines leading into this
*  sprawling shipyard and port.
*  There are warehouses, there's fuel depots.
*  It's not only a vital part of the economy in Odessa, but for Ukraine more broadly.
*  So when Putin announced his invasion, there was a feeling that the Kremlin thought it
*  could take Odessa without having to destroy Odessa.
*  And in the first weeks of the war, I remember one of the few places that was somewhat unscathed
*  by Russian missiles and bombs was Odessa.
*  The first bombing wasn't recorded until I think it was three or four weeks into the
*  war itself.
*  And that was just on the outskirts of Odessa.
*  But the city still suffered.
*  With the naval blockade, the port was completely shut down.
*  The economic engine of the city stops running.
*  Russian warships menace off the coast.
*  There's a threat of an amphibious invasion.
*  People go to the beach not for leisure, but to pack sand into sandbags.
*  And so a city known for its celebration of life and its sense of humor and its rockiness
*  and its joyeux-de-vive has gone silent to a large degree.
*  So set against that tense backdrop, the first ship is loaded with grain in a port in Odessa.
*  And on August 1st of last year, it sets out to sea.
*  It's really this sort of dramatic scene all across the city.
*  As the captain pulls out, he gives the traditional three blasts of the horn.
*  And people across the city, they stop.
*  And people have tears in their eyes.
*  It's like, okay, maybe the port might start to come back to life.
*  And so does life come back to Odessa and the port?
*  Well, obviously it's nothing like it is before the war.
*  But ships are coming into Odessa again.
*  They are being loaded with grain.
*  They are making their way out to the global market.
*  Workers are filling those ships and captains are sailing them out to sea.
*  Every few months, the deal basically had to be renewed.
*  And so there would be these periods where the amount of ships allowed in would slow.
*  And there would be questions of if it would be renewed and tensions around it.
*  But really, for the most part, it held.
*  Over the course of the entire initiative, something like 33 million tons of grain
*  was able to make its way from the Black Sea to the global market.
*  So for a while there, it looks like this global food crisis, this meltdown, has kind of been averted, right?
*  Yeah, remarkably, the deal holds.
*  There are problems and hiccups, but grain is moving.
*  Until it isn't, and the deal falls apart.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Mark, what happens?
*  Why does the deal fall apart so suddenly?
*  The agreement, which assures Ukrainian grain can be transported through the Black Sea,
*  is due to expire on July 17.
*  The groundbreaking deal has been renewed three times since its first signing,
*  but it may not be renewed again.
*  Well, I think we started to see the tension building as the renewal date started to approach.
*  One of the last two ships carrying grain through the Black Sea corridor anchored at Istanbul Saturday.
*  By the end of June, the last ship approved by Russia to be part of this deal came into the ports in Odessa.
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin is threatening to walk away from the Black Sea grain deal
*  unless some sanctions are lifted.
*  And then as the date of the renewal drew closer, we saw Putin get more fiery in his rhetoric
*  and start to make more demands and say essentially, enough is enough.
*  If we don't get the grain deal, we think we should stop our participation.
*  And then, last week, Monday,
*  Moscow says it won't extend the agreement.
*  the Kremlin says they're done.
*  That night, bombs start falling on the port in Odessa.
*  The next day, you have the Kremlin say that any ship that is seen sailing towards Ukraine
*  will be considered hostile and could be blown out of the water.
*  A second night of what Ukraine describes as hellish aerial assault by Russia on the city of Odessa.
*  And then the next night, Odessa is bombed again.
*  And the next night,
*  These were targeted attacks in exactly the place where grain exports are to take place.
*  And this has now become probably the most intense bombardment sustained by Odessa
*  throughout the course of the 16-month war.
*  I was there for a few nights of it and the attack would come in waves.
*  It would be attack drones.
*  It would be missiles fired on a ballistic trajectory to give them this incredible speed.
*  Russia was also firing anti-ship missiles.
*  And these missiles, they skim along the surface of the sea,
*  making them remarkably hard to shoot down.
*  And Odessa, spared early in the war, now finds itself squarely in Moscow's crosshairs.
*  What a devastating, remarkable 180 in basically less than a week,
*  from deal to no deal, from relative peace to all-out bombardment.
*  Why do we think Russia is doing this?
*  Well, there is first the Kremlin's stated reason,
*  which is they say they're not getting what they want out of this deal.
*  The sanctions are not being eased in a way that they find sufficient for the country.
*  Of course, they add stuff to what they say they want,
*  and the Ukrainians see it as just nothing but pure blackmail.
*  But second, whatever the Kremlin says, it's also important to keep in mind
*  just what a different place we're in now than when this deal was first negotiated
*  and agreed to back in August of last summer.
*  Russia's in a much weakened state, and so, quite frankly, is President Putin,
*  who just faced an uprising within his own ranks of his military.
*  And so, in this weakened position, one of the levers that Moscow still has at its disposal
*  is the economic pressure it's putting on the country,
*  because the export of agricultural goods and grain
*  is an essential part of the Ukrainian economy.
*  The shutting off of that has a real impact.
*  And then thirdly, globally, Russia is showing that it can still reach a point
*  where it can still wreak havoc on a very important global market,
*  in this case, the food market.
*  And again, the Ukrainians say it's Russia using food as a weapon,
*  trying to hold the world hostage to its demands,
*  saying, we will not allow this food to go out unless you give us what we want.
*  The US, Europeans agree with that assessment,
*  that what Russia is doing here is just essentially blackmail.
*  So essentially, this would be a way to sort of stick it to the international community for the Russians.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And perhaps their hope is that they could then, by pressuring the international community,
*  hope the international community then puts pressure on Ukraine
*  to look for some sort of negotiated settlement,
*  which, quite frankly, does not seem to be on the table at the moment in any fashion.
*  So given all that, where do we stand a week since the deal collapsed?
*  So again, remember, the Kremlin said it will deem any ship trying to travel to Ukraine to export grain hostile,
*  meaning they reserve the right to shoot it out of the water.
*  And then the Ukrainians said they will view any ship moving out of either Russian occupied ports in southern Ukraine
*  or Russian ports on the Black Sea itself as potentially hostile,
*  setting up this incredibly tense environment on the Black Sea itself.
*  And so you have surging grain prices,
*  and you have 29 ships that are basically just waiting now out at sea,
*  hoping maybe that they could get to a port in Ukraine and load up with grain.
*  Mark, is there any credible way out of this?
*  Well, Matina, short of Russia rejoining the initiative,
*  which given the events of the past week,
*  Moscow's given no indication they intend to do,
*  the options are pretty risky.
*  What the Ukrainians say they would like to see happen is for the world to basically call Moscow's bluff,
*  for ships to sail along the corridor, load up with grain,
*  take that grain back out into the global market,
*  and basically dare Russia to shoot an internationally flagged civilian ship.
*  But even last week, the US intelligence community was warning that Moscow and its Navy
*  were already mining this route in a way that they could then maybe try and blame Ukraine
*  should one of these ships blow up.
*  So it's fraught with risk and this plan to have any chance of actually becoming a reality.
*  Even the Ukrainians say they need something essential, which is Turkey,
*  to signal that they will protect these ships moving through this corridor.
*  And Turkey taking that step would be a real break with Russia, right?
*  Yeah, I mean, no matter how personally upset Erdogan might be with Putin for pulling out,
*  to take such a step would basically side with Ukraine.
*  And he has very carefully positioned himself throughout the war
*  as the broker between the two nations rather than taking one side explicitly.
*  And even if Turkey were to give this signal, you still have other added complications,
*  particularly private shipping companies and insurers who might be loath to send a ship
*  through mine-infested waters with the threat of Russian warships shooting at them.
*  Yeah, that all sounds wildly unlikely to work.
*  Yeah, but again, I think we've seen over the course of the 16 months of this war
*  that the future is also fraught.
*  So I think at the moment, everyone's just watching and waiting to see what happens next.
*  And of course, the longer we wait for this situation to play out,
*  the closer we get to another food crisis because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, there's already a million tons of grain waiting in ports in Odessa at the moment.
*  And the more grain that piles up there,
*  the less food there is on plates on people's tables across the world.
*  Mark, thank you.
*  Thank you, Matina.
*  On Monday, Russia expanded its assault on Ukraine.
*  It expanded its assault on Ukraine's grain exports,
*  using drones to attack a port along the Danube River,
*  about 70 miles from the Black Sea.
*  The strikes signaled that Russia is now seeking to destroy
*  every available way for Ukraine to ship its grain to the rest of the world.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  In Israel on Monday, the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu
*  followed through with its plan to limit the power of the country's Supreme Court,
*  despite protests from tens of thousands of Israelis
*  and the explicit opposition of the Biden administration.
*  The plan, adopted during a dramatic vote by Israel's parliament,
*  would prevent the court from overturning many decisions made by Netanyahu and his ministers,
*  shielding his government from traditional judicial oversight.
*  The battle over the judiciary has become one of the biggest political showdowns
*  in modern Israeli history, pitting secular Israelis who opposed the plan
*  against religious nationalists who supported it.
*  Dozens of major businesses shut down on Monday.
*  Israel's largest labor union said it may call for a national strike,
*  and more than 10,000 military reservists are threatening to resign from duty.
*  On Monday night, Netanyahu seemed to acknowledge the protesters during a televised speech,
*  offering to postpone the plan for even bigger changes to the country's court system.
