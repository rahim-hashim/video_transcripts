# A Love Letter to Camp Mystic
**New York Times - The Daily:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=8.94s)]
*  By Monday evening, the death toll from the flooding in central Texas had surpassed 100, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=14.34s)]
*  27 of them from a single place. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=20.7s)]
*  Camp Mystic, a century old all-girls Christian summer camp. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=24.82s)]
*  Today, the story of what that camp meant to the generations of girls who attended it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=30.82s)]
*  I spoke with one of them, Aaron Pysan. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=39.3s)]
*  It's Tuesday, July 8th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=45.7s)]
*  Well, Aaron, thank you for making time for us. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=49.82s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=54.9s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=56.66s)]
*  I spent a hard three days for a lot of us in the Mystic community. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=57.66s)]
*  My first year at Mystic was 1975, when I was 10. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=65.8s)]
*  And my mom sent me for five weeks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=71.42s)]
*  And how many years did you end up at Camp Mystic? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=74.86s)]
*  Okay, so it was a bubble in, tumble in, look in, look out. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=78.86s)]
*  Idiots. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=86.46s)]
*  Idiots. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=87.46s)]
*  That's the name of a cabin? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=88.46s)]
*  Idiots Delight was the name of it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=89.46s)]
*  I was there six summers. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=92.74s)]
*  I was not there as much as a lot of other people. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=95.34s)]
*  But it was just a very special place for me in the years that I've spent there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=98.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, those are very formative years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=102.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=104.78s)]
*  Well, Aaron, that's what we want to talk to you about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=106.78s)]
*  What Camp Mystic means to people, what it meant to campers like you, and why it occupied [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=111.06s)]
*  such a big place in the lives of so many people. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=119.94s)]
*  And I wonder if you could take us back to the very beginning of Camp Mystic for you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=124.7s)]
*  Talk about your first impressions of this place. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=132.18s)]
*  Let me tell you about how I chose Camp Mystic. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=135.7s)]
*  My older brother went to Camp Stewart, which is on the other fork of the river. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=139.82s)]
*  And when we were down there picking him up, we went across a bridge that crosses the waterfront [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  of Camp Mystic. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=151.26s)]
*  And all these girls were out on the riverfront, splashing and playing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=152.5s)]
*  And it was just so beautiful. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=157.78s)]
*  I was six years old, and I said to mom, I want to go to that camp. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=160.7s)]
*  And that's how I ended up at Camp Mystic. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=166.14s)]
*  I was not one of those kids who was on a generational list. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=168.33999999999997s)]
*  Just explain that generational list. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=172.38s)]
*  It was such a special place that generations of women wanted to send their daughters or [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=174.66s)]
*  granddaughters. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=179.66s)]
*  And there was only a certain amount of space. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=181.89999999999998s)]
*  So if you wanted your daughter or granddaughter to go, you had to get on the list early. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=184.98s)]
*  And some people thought it was birth. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=190.14s)]
*  Get on the list at birth. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=193.77999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=195.22s)]
*  And my mom was a single parent of four children. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=196.22s)]
*  We were not like an elite family. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  And somehow my mom, I don't know, I got off the list and went. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  Well paint a picture of what this place is like for the younger version of you when you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=209.54s)]
*  arrive. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=216.77999999999997s)]
*  Clearly you had an idea of it from seeing it from the waterfront with your brother. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=218.74s)]
*  But when you actually get there. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=223.74s)]
*  So let it be known that I packed my trunk in December. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=226.22s)]
*  I was so excited. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=229.66s)]
*  December for a summer that was many, many, many, many months away. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=230.9s)]
*  I was second term. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=233.86s)]
*  I wasn't even first term. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=235.02s)]
*  I went in early July. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=236.34s)]
*  And when that day finally comes, you get on that bus with a lot of older girl campers [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=239.1s)]
*  that have gone for years. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=244.74s)]
*  And these are girls who are in high school. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=247.1s)]
*  And you're like, and you're heading down toward the hill country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=248.7s)]
*  And the best part is you're looking for the mystic sign. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=253.85999999999999s)]
*  There is a lighted sign that overlooks the river. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=256.94s)]
*  And so as soon as you start to see the mystic sign and turn that corner, everyone just starts [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=260.42s)]
*  screaming because they are so excited to go through those gates. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=267.14s)]
*  And people get off of that bus and they go running for their friends from the summer [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=273.26000000000005s)]
*  before. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=277.38s)]
*  I just so struck by the excitement and the joy that you are conveying in this moment. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=278.38s)]
*  I mean, you are very far removed from this experience, but you're you're right back there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=284.38s)]
*  Well, listen, I am not lying. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  And you could have my two daughters on this call who know that when I die, my ashes are [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=294.74s)]
*  to be spread at Camp Mystic. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=299.58000000000004s)]
*  It runs that deep for people who went to that camp. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  It was a very, very safe space. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=306.38s)]
*  You know, it just was a clean slate. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=310.42s)]
*  No one knew what you were like at school every day. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=313.66s)]
*  No one knew that I was the geeky kid. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  I just was a Camp Mystic girl. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=319.34000000000003s)]
*  I didn't even have a present father. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=322.06s)]
*  I didn't know what anybody else's father did or how much money or the size of the house [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=324.22s)]
*  they lived in. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=328.86s)]
*  It was a space where people could come and it was a level playing field. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=330.38s)]
*  You're describing an experience of being anonymous in the best possible way because from what [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=336.42s)]
*  you're saying, you didn't have an idyllic childhood. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=342.62s)]
*  I felt different from. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=346.62s)]
*  My mom was a busy mom. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=349.74s)]
*  She was one of the only divorced parents when I went off to camp. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=351.54s)]
*  So I did not have an idyllic childhood. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=356.44s)]
*  I had a privileged childhood. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=358.5s)]
*  But you know, just because you're privileged doesn't mean that things are always going [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=361.58s)]
*  well at home. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=364.74s)]
*  And I think a lot of kids were grappling with themselves and they came to Mystic and it [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=365.82s)]
*  was just a place to be a child. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=371.02s)]
*  What did it mean to be at a camp with only other girls? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=374.26s)]
*  Well, I didn't have an older sister. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=379.7s)]
*  I had an older brother and he was great, but I looked up to girls. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=384.58s)]
*  I don't think I understood that at the time. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=390.74s)]
*  And it was also a place where you could just be silly. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  And I don't know that I would have been silly in front of boys at that age. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=400.38s)]
*  There were all kinds of shenanigans always going on in camp Mystic between these girls. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=404.62s)]
*  I mean, there were pranks. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=409.06s)]
*  What's your favorite shenanigan? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=410.06s)]
*  I probably shouldn't mention this one. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=412.66s)]
*  But you would be standing in line waiting to get into the dining hall and someone would [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=414.7s)]
*  just come up and yank your pants down to your ankles. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=418.86s)]
*  I mean, it was those kinds of crazy funny, we rolled around in the mud and we threw mud [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=422.18s)]
*  at each other and you know, just. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=427.42s)]
*  You were free to be exactly who you wanted to be in that moment. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=430.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=434.22s)]
*  At a time, I guess we should say when you're just figuring out who you are. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=435.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=438.82s)]
*  And it was so easy because it was such a beautiful place. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=440.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, just describe this beautiful place, the layout, the geography. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=444.06s)]
*  Once you're there, you're off that bus. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=449.26s)]
*  What do you see and what do you feel? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=451.74s)]
*  The road into Mystic is something I still dream about on a regular basis. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=453.94s)]
*  You roll through the gate and on your left is a huge swath, which is called the golf [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  course, but I think it's used for a lot of different things. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=464.21999999999997s)]
*  But it's a very open field with the background of the hills. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=466.74s)]
*  It is spectacular view. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=472.38s)]
*  And that's where the Mystic sign at night is lit up and shines over the river. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=474.58s)]
*  And then the waterfront, which was what initially drew me. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=480.34000000000003s)]
*  We spent a lot of time having campfires down by the water and the smell. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=484.62s)]
*  Oh, you know. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=491.02s)]
*  What is the smell? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=492.22s)]
*  The smell is the trees and the cedar and the river. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=493.3s)]
*  I wonder if you can spend a little more time on that river. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=499.34000000000003s)]
*  Clearly it's what drew you into this place. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=503.46000000000004s)]
*  And what is it like and what role does it play in the life of the camp? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  The river is like a character because if you had an eight o'clock swim class, you were [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=511.26s)]
*  dreading going in that river because it was frigging cold. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=517.86s)]
*  But it was also a place of refreshment. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=522.14s)]
*  They had these huge floats on the river that you could swim out to and jump off of. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=526.74s)]
*  There was a diving board, there was snorkeling, there was canoeing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=533.46s)]
*  And we spent a lot of time having campfires down by the water. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=538.74s)]
*  There was a song called Peace I Ask of the O'River. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=544.72s)]
*  We sang it at bonfires. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=549.58s)]
*  And then there was the, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=552.46s)]
*  There's a camp on the Guadalupe River. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=554.38s)]
*  It is the camp of my dreams. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=558.98s)]
*  Where the whippoorwills call softly and the bright moon beams. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=563.9s)]
*  There's a camp on the Guadalupe River. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=573.02s)]
*  Your hearts are loyal and true. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=577.62s)]
*  Camp Mystic, I will pledge my true and faithful love to you. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=582.66s)]
*  I sang that to my children in the Mola night when they were babies. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=593.54s)]
*  What does it feel like to sing that song right now? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=599.18s)]
*  It's just, it's heartbreaking. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=603.46s)]
*  It really is. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=605.02s)]
*  Honestly, you know, I live with a man who, when he can't sleep, he plays a golf course in his mind. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=607.06s)]
*  I go straight to the river at Camp Mystic. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=615.26s)]
*  And it calms me because at night, the way that the bonfires, the campfires on the river happened, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=619.2199999999999s)]
*  where everybody lined up by cabin, and oftentimes we were holding candles, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=627.5s)]
*  and you sang all the way to the river, and you brought a towel, and you sat in the cool, wet grass. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=632.98s)]
*  And the river was just like glass some nights. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=639.6600000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=644.1s)]
*  Calm. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=645.1400000000001s)]
*  Calm. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=646.1400000000001s)]
*  So in the restless version of your night, when you see this river, you see the calm, idyllic version. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=651.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I just go to Camp Mystic in my mind. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=659.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, I just picture being there and how I felt. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=662.3399999999999s)]
*  Erin, were you or anyone else in the camp ever instructed to think about this river, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=670.2199999999999s)]
*  which is clearly the source of so much joy and activity? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=679.02s)]
*  Were you ever told to see it as something that could be dangerous? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=683.8599999999999s)]
*  Well, not from a flooding standpoint, but nobody ever went near the water without a counselor near them. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=688.18s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=694.38s)]
*  Now, I do, okay, here's one thing I do remember. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=695.38s)]
*  The thing I was most afraid of was someone crossing the river in the middle of the night [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=699.22s)]
*  because there were so many horror movies out, you know. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=704.34s)]
*  And, oh, an outsider somehow getting across the river to the campers. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=707.18s)]
*  The camp was very protective of campers, you know. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=710.18s)]
*  Their safety was numero uno. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=713.38s)]
*  And so they had a night watchman and he sat in a waterfront chair with a shotgun every night. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=716.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=722.94s)]
*  I felt protected, you know. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=723.46s)]
*  There was a lot of protocol around safety there. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=726.3000000000001s)]
*  But not around flooding? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=729.5s)]
*  No. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=731.66s)]
*  No. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=733.78s)]
*  Not prior to 78. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=736.7s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=746.98s)]
*  Erin, when did you come to understand that flooding was a potential danger at this camp? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=763.98s)]
*  1978. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=769.98s)]
*  I was 13 and I don't really even remember it raining all that hard when we went to bed. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=772.98s)]
*  I was on the top bunk and in the middle of the night, I mean, you could start to hear the rain really coming down. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=781.5s)]
*  It woke me up and I got up and I looked out and there was this huge cypress tree right next to the creek. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=787.98s)]
*  At the top of this cypress tree, there was a light that lit the way up the hill and the water was just below the light. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=799.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=808.98s)]
*  And I was terrified. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=809.98s)]
*  And I can't remember whether my counselor was already up and could see what was going on. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=814.98s)]
*  But I walked over to her and I said, we got to get out of here. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=819.98s)]
*  You could tell that this was flooding? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=823.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=825.98s)]
*  So we were all told that we were going to be moved up to a cabin called Angel's Attic. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=826.98s)]
*  So you were pretty much evacuated from your cabin. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=833.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=836.98s)]
*  We didn't have food for a couple of days. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=837.98s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=839.98s)]
*  And what I do remember was cars going down the river, deer, animals, all kinds of big things that you're just like, oh my God. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=840.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=852.98s)]
*  And the golf course looked like the Pacific Ocean. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=853.98s)]
*  I just couldn't believe I was looking out on all this water that was just raging. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=857.98s)]
*  And then what really resonated with me was how devoted the staff was to keeping everybody safe. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=865.98s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=875.98s)]
*  The water was starting to recede a little bit, but it was still raging. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=877.98s)]
*  And I remember watching with horror as a counselor that were trying to get food over to us like peanut butter sandwiches or something from the dining hall. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=881.98s)]
*  And they got on a horse. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=891.98s)]
*  And I remember watching them try to get across. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=895.98s)]
*  And I was like, please, God, please, please don't let anything happen to these people. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=899.98s)]
*  Everyone was just waiting, you know, just couldn't believe they were trying to get to us because it was still really dangerous. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=904.98s)]
*  But understand that the flood of 78 was nothing. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=912.98s)]
*  It just doesn't, that pales in comparison to what just happened. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=917.98s)]
*  Well, knowing what you know about flooding at this camp, when did you first hear that there had been another much, much worse flood? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=923.98s)]
*  Well, I'm constantly on the Camp Mystic alumni reunion site on social media. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=934.98s)]
*  So I think I must have started to see things on that first. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=939.98s)]
*  And people were just in a frenzy, just so grieved. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=946.98s)]
*  Everybody's just heartbroken. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=954.98s)]
*  But honestly, until yesterday, I was completely numb. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=956.98s)]
*  Yesterday, I just fell apart. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=960.98s)]
*  Yesterday was the day that I just broke. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=962.98s)]
*  When I started seeing some of the pictures of these campers, one is two little girls that were best friends, Lila Bonner and her little friend, Ella. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=964.98s)]
*  With their arms around each other just broke me. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=975.98s)]
*  Just broke me. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=980.98s)]
*  And then the footage of the girls that were being evacuated. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=982.98s)]
*  Can you tell me about that footage? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=989.98s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=992.98s)]
*  They're seeing the destruction. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=994.98s)]
*  And they're singing through it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=997.98s)]
*  That's what we did at Mystic. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1006.98s)]
*  You know, we just sang. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1008.98s)]
*  So really in the middle of the worst thing that will likely ever happen to us, we're just going to have to get through it. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1014.98s)]
*  So really in the middle of the worst thing that will likely ever happen to these girls, they are invoking the songs that you learned when you first got there. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1021.98s)]
*  And that seems so essential to the culture of this place. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1031.98s)]
*  They're taking care of each other. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1034.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1036.98s)]
*  That's part of being what they call a Mystic girl. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1038.98s)]
*  We look out for each other. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1041.98s)]
*  And we trust God. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1043.98s)]
*  You know, whoever that is for you. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1046.98s)]
*  You know? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1048.98s)]
*  We're going to be over whelming, never ending, reckless lover. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1051.98s)]
*  Can I ask you what may feel like a very delicate question about these floods? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1062.98s)]
*  And perhaps it strikes you as too early to ask this. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1069.98s)]
*  But your own experience makes me want to ask you it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1072.98s)]
*  it. This wonderful place floods with some frequency. It happened to you in 78, but in [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1076.98s)]
*  my reading and in the reporting from our colleagues at the Times, it happened again with deadly [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1086.54s)]
*  consequences in, I think, 1987 in this region and even more deadly consequences this past [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1090.22s)]
*  weekend, July 4th. How do you think about why, whether it's parents or local officials, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1097.58s)]
*  the folks who run the camp, why people keep tolerating the risk level of these floods [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1105.78s)]
*  and perhaps not doing a ton to mitigate them? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1114.54s)]
*  Like in 1978, that flood rose so fast in the middle of the night that you couldn't see. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1124.18s)]
*  They could see or predict it was going to rise that fast. So what would have worked? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1132.02s)]
*  A siren system in that area, to my knowledge, I don't know. I mean, it is so remote down [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1138.02s)]
*  there that trying to put a siren system in is not something I'm sure they looked at it. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1143.7s)]
*  They did. In fact, the local officials talked about it. But I'm hearing you say you're not [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1152.06s)]
*  convinced that even if the best system was in place, it would necessarily prevent the [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1156.02s)]
*  I think it's a difficult, it's a huge lift in that area because you can barely get cell [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1159.78s)]
*  service and these camps are so spread out, you know. But honestly, as someone who lived [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1164.54s)]
*  through a flood down there that came on the camp so fast that nobody could have stopped [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1171.5800000000002s)]
*  it, even a siren system, I mean, I don't know. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1175.14s)]
*  Well, what do you think happens to Camp Mystic now? The damage is really extraordinary. And [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1183.3s)]
*  there's the reality that folks may not want to send their children back to a place that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1193.34s)]
*  has now flooded so catastrophically and could in theory flood catastrophically again. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1201.34s)]
*  Well, of course, I would love to see Camp Mystic come back, but I don't think, yeah, I don't [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1208.98s)]
*  know. Maybe this was a wake up call for the community that the money needs to be invested [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1213.54s)]
*  in something. I don't know. I don't know what that answer is. All I can say is it was a [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1220.94s)]
*  very important place to me and many other young girls and women still is. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1226.98s)]
*  I wonder if after everything that's just happened, when you are sitting in bed restless at night, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1234.06s)]
*  if you think you will still think back to the image of the river, this calm river, which [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1241.74s)]
*  is what you said you think about. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1249.5s)]
*  You know what? I will never not go to that river. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1251.74s)]
*  Does it become sort of a character in my mind that can be angry sometimes? Yes. But I choose [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1262.34s)]
*  to hold on to the beautiful moments there. You could hear the locusts and the crickets [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1269.8999999999999s)]
*  and the crackle of the bonfire. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1277.06s)]
*  And the voices of all these girls singing softly together, you know. I hang on to those [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1282.02s)]
*  things and that's what makes it special. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1302.66s)]

*  On Monday night, hundreds of Camp Mystic alumni and supporters gathered at a park in Dallas [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1349.58s)]
*  for a vigil to mourn those who had died at the camp. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1355.22s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, expressed dismay that a system [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1359.58s)]
*  of flood warning sirens were not in place to protect places like Camp Mystic and said [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1366.86s)]
*  that the state's government would seek to have such a system installed by next summer. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1373.4199999999998s)]
*  Had we had sirens along this area, up and down, that would have blown very loudly, it's [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1379.3799999999999s)]
*  possible that that would have saved some of these lives. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1385.54s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1390.42s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1414.74s)]
*  On Monday, President Trump revived his threat of tariffs ranging from 25% to 40% against [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1418.02s)]
*  countries that have yet to reach trade deals with the U.S. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1425.34s)]
*  Among the countries threatened were Japan, South Korea, and South Africa. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1429.94s)]
*  Trump paused his original tariffs for 90 days until July 9th and has extended that deadline [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1435.42s)]
*  until August 1st. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1441.62s)]
*  The new threats appear designed to encourage deals before then, but so far, the U.S. has [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1443.56s)]
*  reached only two preliminary trade deals with Britain and Vietnam. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1449.76s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Mary Wilson, Claire Tenesketter, and Olivia Natt. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF2hKA-g3pk&t=1460.32s)]
