# Inflation Is Way Down. Is It by Design or Just Luck?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZ1VGj-EE2o)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is a daily.
*  Today, after two years of record high consumer prices, inflation is falling in a big way.
*  The question now being asked by economists, according to my colleague Gina Smilich, is whether that's by design or by accident.
*  It's Tuesday, January 20th.
*  We know the goal is down. How down is this? This is down. This is the slowest pace in two years.
*  We're getting there just very slowly. Fed meets tomorrow. Big decision coming.
*  In light of how far we've come in tightening policy, today we decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged.
*  The Federal Reserve hit the pause button today on hiking interest rates as it tries to tame inflation.
*  That is a significant shift after 10 straight meetings where they raised interest rates.
*  This is a really important moment for the economy and for the Federal Reserve. It has been on this mission where it's...
*  Gina, good morning. Good morning.
*  We wanted to talk to you as our resident inflation expert because it now feels that the US government's long-term plan to try to lower inflation
*  by raising the interest rate month after month after month is working.
*  And it feels that way for two reasons. The first is that a few days ago we got data showing that monthly inflation is now less than half of what it was last summer.
*  It's a really big decline. And right on cue a day later, the Federal Reserve decided to pause its program of raising interest rates,
*  which seemed to confirm the idea that inflation is in retreat. And so we come to you, Gina, to ask,
*  are we correct to understand that the government's policies are slaying the inflationary beast?
*  So I can totally see why you would think that because inflation has fallen quite a bit and that is obviously really good news.
*  Right.
*  But I think the key question here and the question you're asking is whether policy is responsible.
*  And the answer to that one is pretty complicated right now.
*  The way I like to think about this is that we're really in a story where we're talking about luck on one hand and policy on the other.
*  Okay. That's a great sounding framework, luck versus policy. Explain it.
*  It means basically what it sounds like. Some of the decline in inflation that we're seeing is a result of policy from the Federal Reserve.
*  But a lot of it is luck, which is to say that raising interest rates have little or nothing to do with it.
*  Okay. Give us an example of luck-based inflation decline.
*  So I think that there are really two big areas that have experienced significant declines in inflation
*  that had to do with luck or the way the world was expected to play out rather than purely sort of the policy response to inflation.
*  Gas and groceries.
*  Two very big categories of expense in life.
*  Exactly. And so I think gas is a good place to start.
*  It really started to jump over the last couple of summers.
*  And you probably remember, you know, when a gallon of gas costs something like $5 just for regular at the pump.
*  I very, very well remember it because it turns into like a $70 tank of gas.
*  Exactly. It was really painful for consumers. And that's come down by a lot.
*  It's now like $3.59 a gallon.
*  Similarly, for groceries, you probably remember that eggs, for instance, four or five months ago were something like $5 a dozen.
*  And they're now down quite a bit to something more like $2.50.
*  Right. 50% decline. Very meaningful.
*  Exactly. And so those are big declines, but they aren't necessarily categories that are sort of rooted in the Fed's policy response.
*  Really, what we're seeing here is the sort of result of some big outside events.
*  Why don't you start with gas? I mean, why is the decline in gas pretty much unrelated to federal policy and much more in the realm of luck?
*  Right. So just in general, changes in oil and gas prices are almost always the result of sort of big global trends.
*  Decisions made by Russia, decisions made by Saudi Arabia, the speed of growth in other big economies like China.
*  And so those things sort of move the price of gas around.
*  You can get some domestic policies, like some things the White House can do can matter to oil prices around the edges.
*  But mostly this is sort of this big external force acting on the economy.
*  Got it. So not really because of federal policy?
*  Not primarily.
*  OK. And what about the big declines in grocery prices?
*  Why do we not attribute that to rising interest rates?
*  So I think we can start with egg prices, which we've previously talked about.
*  So we obviously know that egg prices spiked really high earlier this year in January.
*  They hit that five dollar mark almost. And that was really about bad luck.
*  We had a really bad bout of avian flu that was killing millions of chickens.
*  And so chicken prices jumped, egg prices jumped.
*  But more recently, that's really started to clear up, which has been good luck.
*  And so it's helped to bring prices down.
*  And this is sort of what you see with food overall.
*  By and large, when we think about things like food prices, we often think that they are pretty sensitive to big movements in commodity prices, in grain prices, in dairy prices.
*  And so they're just not good as a clear read on where the economy is headed or how policy is working.
*  Right. Because the Fed does not eradicate avian flu.
*  It does not spare the lives of chickens.
*  So this is not a good measure of policy working.
*  Like you said, it's a measure of kind of agrarian luck.
*  Exactly. You're not going to get a clean assessment off of food prices.
*  So very interestingly, Gina, the decline of inflation in these two big areas where higher prices most directly impact us as consumers,
*  it's not primarily because our central bank worked its magic.
*  But the overall impact is that inflation is really down.
*  Yes, inflation is really down.
*  And another reason that overall inflation is down so much is because we've really seen a lot of healing in supply chains,
*  which as listeners probably remember, got really messed up during and after the coronavirus pandemic and which have been slowly getting back to normal.
*  So the part of inflation we're worried about now is the part that's not going to come down just because of a return to normal or because of luck,
*  but the part that is going to require Fed policy.
*  And we're seeing Fed policies start to work in some categories.
*  But in many categories, we're not seeing that much progress yet.
*  We're seeing this sort of split screen story in the economy where it is certainly the case that some big areas of inflation are moderating.
*  But at the same time, we've got some other big areas that haven't budged very much.
*  And that's why despite inflation cooling down so much over the past few months, we still can't say that we've slayed the inflationary beast.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Gina, right before the break, you said that there are areas where the Federal Reserve's policy is starting to do what it's supposed to do,
*  which is lower inflation, despite the fact that in a lot of areas it can't quite make that happen.
*  So I want to zero in on the areas where Fed policy is working.
*  So what's an example of that?
*  So the one I would come back to most often, I think, is rents.
*  So there was a while back in really the summer of 21 and into the spring of 2022 where rent increases were just crazy.
*  If you live in New York, you probably remember rent was going up so fast.
*  This was like brunch conversation.
*  The rents were so quick.
*  This is like the story of the $6,000 one bedroom.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And that was really, really bad news on the inflation front because rents make up just a huge chunk of the inflation calculation.
*  The good news here is that rents have really slowed down in the market.
*  So what we're seeing is that sort of real time data providers are telling us that for basically the past year, rents have been much slower to rise.
*  And so that should really help to allow overall inflation to cool.
*  And that is probably a little bit of a Fed story.
*  Why? How do we know that?
*  So one of the big ways in which rents are a Fed story is that they very closely track what's happening in the labor market and how confident people are feeling.
*  So if you're making better wages, if you're feeling confident you're going to get that new job and you're going to get a raise because everyone loves you at work,
*  you're going to feel much more comfortable springing for that jacuzzi bathtub and taking on the slightly higher rent that comes alongside it.
*  And so rents can be in a way a sort of economic sentiment indicator, or at least they're very closely connected.
*  And so I think that if you want to point to a clear place where Fed policy is working, that's probably it.
*  So just to be sure I understand this, Gina, when interest rates go up, as they have now for many, many months,
*  the economy starts to look a little bit less rosy to a typical worker.
*  And you start to wonder if your economic prospects are going to be as strong as they once looked.
*  And maybe you think twice about a long term rental commitment, you know, a year or two years that feels like a splurge.
*  And so in that way, Fed policy raising interest rates helps lower the rental price increases that we have been seeing for so many months.
*  Exactly. So when interest rates go up, the labor market slows down a lot.
*  And economists will often tell you that the labor market and rents are very closely related.
*  If your wages are going up, you feel more comfortable paying more.
*  If your wages are stalling out or you're even worried that you might get laid off, you're going to feel much less comfortable paying more.
*  And your landlord just isn't going to be able to put up prices as much.
*  And so rents can be a good barometer of where the overall economy is heading.
*  OK, so that's rent. I'm curious if this phenomenon you're describing is also translating over to housing sales, not rent, but people purchasing homes,
*  of really big, important part of the economy where Fed policy in theory could have this desired impact of slowing things down.
*  So, yes, but housing is a pretty weird situation right now.
*  Higher interest rates absolutely did cool off the housing market last year and sales are still pretty depressed.
*  But what we're seeing is that there's some demand out there sort of lingering on the sidelines and there's not a lot of supply in the housing market.
*  So while home prices actually fell late last year, they've recently started to turn around and climb again.
*  And so I think the upshot here is that the Fed did cool housing, but it hasn't exactly kept it in a deep freeze.
*  OK, and it sounds like you're saying they would like for it to be in something resembling a deep freeze.
*  Yeah, I think that a deep freeze would give them confidence that they have cooled off the economy in this way that's being sustained.
*  And instead, what we're seeing is that the economy still has some oomph despite everything that the Fed has done.
*  And it's one of the reasons that in some pretty important categories, you really just haven't seen price increases come down that much.
*  Right, because oomph is another word for prices that are a little bit higher than we'd like.
*  Yeah, if you have stronger demand, if you have that little bit of consumer oomph, it allows companies to keep raising their prices.
*  I could just keep saying oomph all day long. But can you tell us where in the economy the prices remain stubbornly high and where as a result,
*  we can understand the Fed policy to have been stymied?
*  Yeah, so one word here, services. And by that I mean stuff like childcare, concert tickets, haircuts.
*  You know, anything that you buy that's a non-physical good that really is sort of very labor based.
*  That's sort of the area we're worried about right now.
*  And what's our understanding of why those categories, which like groceries and like gas, are a pretty big part of your life, right?
*  Like, why are these categories so difficult for the Fed's policy to pierce and to bring prices down on?
*  So it's a couple of things simultaneously. One is that wage growth remains relatively quick.
*  And that matters in two ways. It matters first because if as a company you are paying more,
*  you are likely going to try and pass along those higher costs to your consumers in the form of higher prices.
*  It also matters because if as an American shopper you are earning more in wages,
*  you are likely going to be able to turn around and spend a little bit more, even if you're not thrilled about it,
*  when the company that you're buying stuff from is trying to charge you.
*  And so it helps to keep prices climbing.
*  The other thing is that corporations have gotten pretty used to charging more.
*  And so we're seeing a situation where they know they have a little bit of ability to push up prices,
*  and they're doing that either to maintain or to grow their profits.
*  These are sort of a bunch of trends that you and I, Michael, and you and other guests have talked about in the past.
*  But what's surprising is that they remain true, even in spite of everything the Fed has done to cool down the economy.
*  Fascinating.
*  Gina, I'm curious about something.
*  If rent increases go down because workers slash consumers start to psychologically feel things are a little more delicate,
*  how does that square with what you just said that workers slash consumers are feeling good enough
*  that they're willing to pay for higher prices on things like concert tickets and haircuts?
*  How do we make sense of that?
*  Well, if you think about it, a rental agreement is really sort of a bet on the future.
*  You're entering into a 12-month or 24-month agreement, and you're saying you're going to pay this amount for that entire period.
*  And so you have to assess whether you're going to be able to do that.
*  Whereas a haircut or a concert ticket, something that is a little bit more in the moment,
*  is really a reflection of how you're feeling about your finances just today, not looking forward to the future.
*  And so they don't have sort of that barometer of how you're feeling about your prospects embedded in them.
*  Another thing we probably want to think about with rents is that you've got a certain population that's renting,
*  and they're the people who are likely getting squeezed pretty severely by inflation right now.
*  It is the case that renters tend to skew a little bit younger.
*  They tend to skew a little bit lower income.
*  And so we could see sort of a divided situation in the economy where those folks are really struggling
*  to sustain their spending at a comfortable level and struggling to pay up more to rent the place that they want to rent.
*  Whereas we've got people who own their houses who are a little bit more financially well off,
*  who are a little bit older, and they're still really able to consume like crazy.
*  So Gina, if you're the central bank, if you're the Fed, you're probably pretty frustrated
*  that you can't knock some of these stubborn price increases that we've been talking about down
*  after all these months of raising interest rates, which is supposed to make borrowing more expensive,
*  as we talked about, which is supposed to cool down the economy and ultimately bring down prices.
*  And so that makes me wonder why the Federal Reserve didn't use its power to keep trying to lower inflation last week
*  when it had the chance. It could have come out and said, listen, America, we still have work to do here on inflation,
*  and so we're going to have to raise interest rates. We just haven't gotten as far as we'd like to.
*  And instead, the Fed didn't do anything, which is a little bit counterintuitive given everything you've told us here.
*  So why didn't the Fed just raise interest rates another time?
*  Right. So a couple of things here. So the Fed did not raise interest rates, but it's not exactly the case that they didn't do anything.
*  What the Fed did is it hit pause on interest rate increases for the first time in 11 meetings, very big deal.
*  But it also signaled that it's going to raise rates twice more this year, which is more than we had expected.
*  And so that was a bit of a surprise. And I think that the message it sent was we want to be cautious here.
*  We want to try not to blow up the economy, but we're pretty darn worried about where inflation is headed.
*  And the reason I think that the Fed decided to hit pause now and promise to do more or suggest that they might do more
*  later is that we've been pretty worried about banking turmoil recently.
*  Right. The Fed had suggested that it might sort of take a pause, look around, try and assess how the moves it's already made
*  were playing out after we saw a bunch of banks blow up amid rising interest rates.
*  And so I think that that was part of the reason for the caution.
*  And I think part of the reason for the caution is just the Fed has done a lot already.
*  And so it kind of wants to slow walk this to try and make sure that they sort of nail the landing here,
*  that they do enough to get inflation under control, but not so much that they absolutely tank the economy in the process.
*  Right. In other words, this was not a pause in raising interest rates that said, hey, we're in great shape.
*  We've turned a corner. This was a pause that said, let's make sure that we still have a banking sector in a year or so.
*  And oh, by the way, inflation is actually still a problem.
*  And we are going to raise interest rates just not this very moment.
*  Exactly. The Fed was not declaring victory here.
*  So in conclusion, here's where we are. Inflation is down overall quite a bit, but we've learned that a lot of it,
*  the stuff we feel the most, isn't truly the result of Fed policy, which is an important thing to understand.
*  But Gina, if I'm a consumer, how much do I really care about what caused this relatively positive situation?
*  Inflation now down by half since last summer. Grocery store shopping doesn't suck as much as it used to.
*  Traveling by car financially is much more tolerable.
*  Aren't I just pretty happy that all of this stuff has happened?
*  Sure, and reasonably you would be. But if you're a consumer, you also don't want this to be temporary.
*  And 4% inflation is better than 9%, but it's still not as good as 2%, which is what it used to be.
*  So I think that, you know, that's the thing to keep in mind.
*  Gas prices are down right now, but the Fed can't control them and they might rise again.
*  And the same thing could be said for many parts of the economy that the Fed can only control somewhat.
*  And so that is why the Fed is so focused on wrestling inflation the whole way back down to its very low and stable goal
*  and keeping it there in sort of a much more sustainable way.
*  You want to know that policy is working and working in a way that you intend.
*  And we just aren't quite there yet.
*  Right, you really don't want to live in a world, you're saying, where your inflation goes down because of luck.
*  You want it to sustainably go down because of policy so that it truly stays down.
*  Yeah, luck can be good or bad. Policy is much more deliberate.
*  Well, Gina, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Over the weekend, two former members of Donald Trump's presidential cabinet denounced his handling of classified documents
*  and suggested that the evidence contained in the special counsel's indictment against Trump
*  should disqualify him from ever being president again.
*  One of them, Trump's former defense secretary, Mark Esper, called the behavior alleged in the indictment
*  quote, unauthorized, illegal and dangerous.
*  Do you think Trump can be trusted with the nation's secrets ever again?
*  Well, based on his actions, they have proven true under the indictment by the special counsel.
*  No, I mean, it's just irresponsible action that places our service members at risk, places our nation's security at risk.
*  The other, Trump's former attorney general, Bill Barr, described Trump's conduct in the case as quote, reckless
*  and called him a quote, fundamentally flawed person.
*  He's like, you know, he's like a nine year old defiant nine year old kid who's always pushing the glass toward the edge of the table,
*  defying his parents to stop him from doing it.
*  It's a means of self assertion and exerting his dominance over other people.
*  And he's a very petty individual who will always put his interests ahead of the country's.
*  But our country can't be a therapy session for, you know, a troubled man like this.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rachelle Banja, Will Reed and Rob Zipko.
*  It was edited by Lisa Chow and M.J. Davis-Lynn, contains original music by Dan Powell and Marian Lozano and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landfork of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the daily. I'm Michael Bobauro. See you tomorrow.
