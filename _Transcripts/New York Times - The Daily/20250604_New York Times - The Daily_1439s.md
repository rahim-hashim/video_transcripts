Video Description: Operation Spider’s Web was an audacious Ukrainian sneak attack that caused billions of dollars in damage to Russian warplanes — using drones that cost as little as $600.

Marc Santora, a reporter covering the war in Ukraine for The New York Times, explains why this strike on Sunday, which extended 3,000 miles into Russia, is already being seen as a signal event in the evolution of modern warfare.
Guest: Marc Santora, (https://www.nytimes.com/by/marc-santora)  has been reporting from Ukraine since the beginning of the war with Russia.

Background reading

In its attacks on Russian airfields, Ukraine aimed for a strategic and symbolic blow (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-drone-strikes.html) .

Ukraine showed it can still flip the script (https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/02/us/politics/ukraine-russia-drone-attack.html)  on how wars are waged.

# Inside Operation Spider’s Web
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroeff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Today, the story of Operation Spider's Web, an audacious sneak attack by Ukraine that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=10.0s)]
*  caused billions of dollars in damage to Russian warplanes with drones that cost as little [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=20.44s)]
*  as $600. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=26.48s)]
*  My colleague Mark Santora explains why this strike is already being seen as a defining [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=29.4s)]
*  moment in the evolution of modern warfare. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=35.019999999999996s)]
*  It's Wednesday, June 4th. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  Mark, we're coming to you because you are one of the correspondents who has been on [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=53.36s)]
*  the ground for the longest in Ukraine. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=60.88s)]
*  You've been reporting from the front lines, embedding with the Ukrainian military. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=63.36s)]
*  And we now know what happened this past Sunday was unlike anything we have seen so far in [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=69.16s)]
*  this war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  You and a team of reporters have been working to uncover exactly what went down, how it [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=77.44s)]
*  went down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=81.8s)]
*  And I want to get to those specifics here today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=82.8s)]
*  But first, can you just take us through the events as you experience them on Sunday? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=85.16s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=91.64s)]
*  So, you know, you get used to a lot of reports of explosions every day here, whether it's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=92.64s)]
*  here in Ukraine or something going on in Russia. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=97.0s)]
*  But on Sunday around one o'clock, we started to get these really strange reports of explosions [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=101.32s)]
*  3,000 miles from Ukraine. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=108.24s)]
*  First we saw reports of explosions at an airfield all the way in Siberia. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=112.6s)]
*  And as they started to come in, we started to get videos of how these attacks were being [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=120.2s)]
*  conducted. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=123.64s)]
*  It was really weird looking, right? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=124.64s)]
*  Because, you know, we're used to long range Ukrainian drone strikes going after, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=127.92s)]
*  Russian targets inside of Russia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=133.0s)]
*  And here, we saw these trucks parked on the side of the road and then these small little [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=134.44s)]
*  quadcopters rising up from the trailer and taking off. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=141.84s)]
*  And then, you know, cut images to burning planes and airfields. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=146.76s)]
*  And so it quickly became apparent that in terms of how this strike was executed, in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=153.84s)]
*  terms of its ambition, in terms of what it might mean for the war going forward, that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  this was something different. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=163.6s)]
*  This was a signal event in this war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so a very big deal attack carried out in what seems to be a pretty sophisticated [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=167.68s)]
*  way. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=175.4s)]
*  How did this happen, Mark? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=176.68s)]
*  How did Ukraine pull this off? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=178.04s)]
*  Well, this is Ukraine's answer to a problem that has bedeviled them throughout this war, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=180.28s)]
*  which is how do you stop massive long range Russian missile bombardments? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  These are launched from planes flying deep in Russian territory. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  They're missiles fired from ships and submarines out at sea, from land-based systems far inside [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=196.0s)]
*  of Russia. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  So basically out of the reach of the Ukrainians. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  And these bombardments have become so routine in Ukraine that people can actually time when [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  they want to go to the shelter by what's happening. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=211.38000000000002s)]
*  For instance, a Russian bomber will take off from an airbase deep in Russia and you'll [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=213.96s)]
*  get a warning saying that the bombers are at the starting line. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  A warning like on your phone? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, a warning on your phone. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=224.48s)]
*  It'll say Russian bombers TU-95 at the starting line. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=225.48s)]
*  So that means you have about two hours till they get to the launch point. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=229.0s)]
*  You'll get an alarm. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  Missiles have been launched. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  Then you know if you're in Kyiv, say, and depending on where the launch is from, you [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=235.0s)]
*  know you have two, three hours for a cruise missile. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=238.95999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  It's like a countdown to an attack on your phone live. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so these bombers, everyone in Ukraine is intimately familiar with now the TU-95. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=245.68s)]
*  And it's kind of gone in waves in the war. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=250.16s)]
*  The more US support they got with Patriot missiles and other things, the more secure [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=252.96s)]
*  people in some cities felt. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=257.12s)]
*  As American support has faded, some of that feeling of security has faded with it because [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=258.96s)]
*  there's only a few really advanced weapons systems that can go after Russia's most advanced [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=263.56s)]
*  missiles. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=269.8s)]
*  Ukraine never had enough of them, but as America pulls back, they have even less. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=270.8s)]
*  So it sounds like the Ukrainian government looks at this problem and says, okay, this [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=275.2s)]
*  is what we need to solve. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=280.2s)]
*  How do we stop these long-range missile attacks from these Russian bombers? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=281.6s)]
*  100%. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  So the Ukrainians do what they've done throughout this war. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  They have to adapt. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  They have to innovate. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  They have to find a low-cost solution. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  And so what they do is they turn to drones. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  Drones are the things that Ukraine has turned to time and again in this war to survive against [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=298.28s)]
*  an enemy that outnumbers them, that has a vastly bigger arsenal. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=304.11999999999995s)]
*  I mean, honestly, it's kind of hard to imagine how Ukraine would have survived without drones. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  And going to the front line over the last three years, you've just seen how they've [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  transformed the battlefield. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=317.88s)]
*  I mean, every time now, if we go out to a front line position with the Ukrainians, you [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=319.76s)]
*  have someone riding on the front seat with a shotgun because really that's one of the [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=324.52s)]
*  only defenses against some of these kinds of smaller drones. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  So they're able to use these drones to hold defensive positions with fewer people than [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  they might otherwise need. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=337.84s)]
*  But Mark, how does this strategy, while successful on the front lines, get at that original problem [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=340.03999999999996s)]
*  we were talking about, which is striking Russia where it hurts in Russian territory, hitting [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=347.2s)]
*  these bombers? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  So first of all, you know, all these guys on the front line, they're watching every [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=354.84000000000003s)]
*  day as Russian missiles and bombs are hitting the towns and cities where their families [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=358.88000000000005s)]
*  live. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  So they, just like everyone else, are desperate to find a way to do something about this. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  And so Ukraine begins another kind of drone program, which is to make long range drones, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=370.12s)]
*  not these small sort of little quadcopters, but drones that can fly hundreds of miles [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  and carry powerful payloads of explosives. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=382.18s)]
*  So Ukraine for the first time strikes a Russian airfield all the way back in December 2022. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  But Russia obviously starts to adapt to this new capability Ukraine has. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=392.06s)]
*  They've got robust air defenses, but also they start taking other measures. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=397.06s)]
*  They build fortifications around fuel depots at airports. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=401.42s)]
*  They build decoys at the size of fighter jets to confuse the Ukrainians as to what's where. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=405.02000000000004s)]
*  They put tires on the wings of planes in the hopes that if there is an explosion at the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=411.22s)]
*  airport, the shrapnel doesn't do damage. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=415.38000000000005s)]
*  They do a number of steps that, you know, taken together make it exceedingly hard for [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=419.38000000000005s)]
*  the Ukrainians to strike a blow that will do more than glancing damage. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=423.98s)]
*  So again, the solution isn't there yet. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=429.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=432.18s)]
*  So about a year and a half ago, the Ukrainians decided they needed to try something different. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=433.18s)]
*  And they come up with this very secret plan, so secret the Ukrainians said they didn't [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=441.06s)]
*  even tell the Americans. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=445.22s)]
*  They try and find a way to bring these small drones, the ones that have been so effective [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=448.02s)]
*  on the front, into Russia, close to these air bases where these bombers are based in [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=452.98s)]
*  the hopes that they can use them to catch the Russians by surprise. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=460.74s)]
*  And maybe at least slow the Russian bombardments down and give them more of a fighting chance. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=469.26s)]
*  And they call this Operation Spider's Web. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=476.5s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=486.78s)]
*  Okay, Mark, take us inside this operation, Operation Spider's Web. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=491.7s)]
*  So there's a lot we don't know, and we're still working to piece it together. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=503.42s)]
*  But what we do know is that this operation was so high profile that President Zelensky [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=507.48s)]
*  himself oversaw it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=511.78s)]
*  We know it was so secretive they didn't even tell the Americans. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=513.34s)]
*  And we know the goal was to secret these drones into Russia and close to these air bases so [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=516.24s)]
*  they can hit these bombers. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=523.2s)]
*  So Ukraine has to do two things for this operation to be pulled off successfully. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=524.88s)]
*  They have to hide the drones and they have to train the drones. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=528.76s)]
*  And let's start with the hiding. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=531.94s)]
*  They start with thinking to themselves, what is the most common ubiquitous thing you see [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=535.32s)]
*  on the roads? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=539.62s)]
*  And it's shipping containers, these nondescript hulking metal boxes that you see going up [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=540.62s)]
*  and down highways every day and you don't give a second thought. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=546.24s)]
*  They make a decision that they're going to turn those containers into a much more sophisticated [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=549.88s)]
*  weapons delivery system. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  And what does that look like? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=557.08s)]
*  Well, think of a Russian nesting doll, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=558.44s)]
*  Where you have the big doll inside the big doll is a smaller doll and a smaller doll. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=561.0s)]
*  So you have this container with a roof that can be popped off by remote control. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  But then inside of that container, we have another container. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=569.6s)]
*  And that container holds the drones and beneath the drones, chargers for those drones. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=574.28s)]
*  And the roof of that smaller container can also pop off, at which point the drones can [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=581.56s)]
*  take off into the sky and launch their attack the minute they get the signal to go. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=586.66s)]
*  And what makes it even crazier, and we're not 100% sure where each piece of this puzzle [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=592.64s)]
*  was assembled, but President Zelensky said they set up their main sort of headquarters [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=597.12s)]
*  to pull off this operation right across the street from the FSB, which is the Russian [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=601.88s)]
*  Internal Security Services. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=606.9599999999999s)]
*  So they're orchestrating this whole thing from inside of Russia at a secret base that's [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=609.12s)]
*  with a stone's throw from the Russian secret police, according to the Ukrainians. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=614.3599999999999s)]
*  So you have people involved in every step of the way. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  You have the agents who snuck into Russia to help pull this off. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  You had the pilots who were going to fly these drones from a very far remote location back [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=626.0999999999999s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=631.06s)]
*  Each step along the way, you have spies and soldiers and drone pilots involved in executing [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=632.2199999999999s)]
*  this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=639.54s)]
*  Okay, so you said step two was training the drones. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=640.54s)]
*  What did that look like? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=647.4599999999999s)]
*  So the primary target is going to be these bombers. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=649.5999999999999s)]
*  And so they want to teach the software how to hit these bombers to do the most damage [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=652.4599999999999s)]
*  that they can. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=656.9s)]
*  And they happen to have some of these Soviet-era bombers in a museum in central Ukraine, you [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=658.26s)]
*  know, back from the day when Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=663.36s)]
*  Long ago mothballed, but turned out to be quite useful in this mission. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=666.78s)]
*  So what they do is they take some of the most sophisticated new machine learning artificial [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=670.72s)]
*  intelligence algorithms that they've been testing and expanding throughout the war, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=675.58s)]
*  and they train these drones to basically go after the most vulnerable spot on these bombers, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=680.42s)]
*  which is where the fuel is kept basically. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=686.86s)]
*  Just clearly an enormous amount of tradecraft went into this. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=692.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think obviously one of the big questions the Kremlin is wrestling with [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=696.1s)]
*  is how in the world could Ukraine have penetrated so deeply for so long to pull this off? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=700.2600000000001s)]
*  And I think that's a, you know, we don't know the answer to that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=705.9000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so once they have these drones trained up, they have them hidden, they're in the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=709.62s)]
*  country, what's the next step? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=713.58s)]
*  It's time to attack. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=716.62s)]
*  On Sunday around 1.06 PM, they get the order. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=719.22s)]
*  The roof of these containers pops up, the roof containing the drones pops off, and the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=723.74s)]
*  drones start to take to the air. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=729.7s)]
*  And then we start to see explosions, clouds of smoke rising up from airfields. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=733.9s)]
*  And at the same time, drones rising from containers are going and attacking airfields across Russia. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=739.7s)]
*  And then we start to get from our intelligence sources, direct video views from these drones [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=747.54s)]
*  on their attack mission. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=754.2199999999999s)]
*  There's one really compelling one where you see from the drone's vantage point, the same [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=755.3s)]
*  thing the drone pilot would see, it flying over an airfield as two, three bombers are [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=759.74s)]
*  on fire, and it dives in to hit another one. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=765.0999999999999s)]
*  And so you start to see these just wildly dramatic images coming out and the attack [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=768.06s)]
*  is underway. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=772.78s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen these videos, we've published them. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=776.54s)]
*  It really starts to look at this point like a movie, like some sort of scene from Mission [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=782.42s)]
*  Impossible or something. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=788.14s)]
*  I mean, this moment is just remarkable to watch in real time. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=789.62s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's really one of the kind of incredible things about this war that I [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=795.14s)]
*  don't even think we've fully understood, which is just how much of it has unfolded before [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=798.5s)]
*  the cameras. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=803.06s)]
*  But you know, videos, they can lie or not tell the whole story. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=804.06s)]
*  So our colleagues on visual investigations basically set to work right away to try and [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=806.8199999999999s)]
*  piece together both the videos coming from Ukrainian intelligence, but also Russian civilians, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=812.06s)]
*  as well as satellite images, which are still coming out to try and understand, okay, they [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=817.8199999999999s)]
*  were able to orchestrate this attack, but what effect did it have? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=822.38s)]
*  And where we are now, I think 48 hours after the attack unfolded is we can say with confidence [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=826.8199999999999s)]
*  that more than a dozen Russian bombers and planes suffered damage, quite extensive in [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=832.82s)]
*  many cases. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=838.1s)]
*  The Ukrainians say that the number could be as high as 41. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=839.5s)]
*  And that amounts to, if the Ukrainian account is correct, seven billion dollars in damage [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=843.46s)]
*  done by drones that cost a few thousand dollars apiece, even if it's half as much as Ukraine [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=848.62s)]
*  said, and it's closer to the Western estimates, that's still three point five billion dollars [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=853.9000000000001s)]
*  in damage. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=858.22s)]
*  And you have to recall that this is Russia's strategic nuclear bombing fleet. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=859.9399999999999s)]
*  So we've been talking about how Russia has been using these to launch conventional weapons [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=863.8199999999999s)]
*  at Ukraine, cruise missiles. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=868.6999999999999s)]
*  This is also a key element of its strategic nuclear deterrence. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=870.4599999999999s)]
*  And Russia is not thought to have more than a hundred of these, you know, totally, and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=874.1s)]
*  they're not making any more right now. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=877.78s)]
*  So the loss of 10 or 20 would itself be really significant if it's as high as the Ukrainian [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=879.66s)]
*  number, that's a third of that fleet. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=885.38s)]
*  So we'll see what that tally comes to. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=887.64s)]
*  But you know, undoubtedly the attack put a big dent in the fleet. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=889.56s)]
*  It's just remarkable to imagine these tiny, cheap little drones having that kind of an [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=893.6s)]
*  impact. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=898.28s)]
*  But Mark, as you've said, we've seen drones being used in this conflict for a long time [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=899.64s)]
*  now. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=905.56s)]
*  What's different about this time? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=906.56s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, aside from just the boldness of this attack, it is sort of an evolution [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=908.36s)]
*  in a revolution and the revolution of drones for anyone who hasn't been paying attention. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=914.4000000000001s)]
*  I think this attack should drive that home, how it can both affect what militaries think [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  about in terms of their force protection, what they choose to invest in. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  It's kind of like if you're to think about other moments in wars where a new weapon comes [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=929.12s)]
*  to life, the weapon might have existed a bit, but then it's just used to great effect. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=933.62s)]
*  So in World War Two, for instance, you had the Germans using the V1 and V2 rockets to [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=937.6s)]
*  bombard London. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=943.2s)]
*  You know, it would be some time, but that augured in the era of the missile. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=944.6800000000001s)]
*  And we've seen how missiles transformed, you know, how countries fight or think about fighting [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=948.72s)]
*  or plan for fighting. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=953.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think when it comes to drones, they've been around a while. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=955.0400000000001s)]
*  They've obviously what's happened here in Ukraine is it's gotten supercharged. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=957.84s)]
*  And just the amount of adaptation and evolution that we've seen over the course of three and [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=962.08s)]
*  a half years has forced everyone who's paying attention to rethink some of those doctrines [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=967.0s)]
*  that were long held about what does it take to both win on the battlefield and also to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=972.1600000000001s)]
*  prepare for the next fight. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=978.24s)]
*  I also feel like there's another reason this attack is really important, and that's just [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=980.1600000000001s)]
*  the timing of it. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=985.24s)]
*  It comes just a few months after Trump sat with Zelensky in the Oval Office and said [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=986.84s)]
*  Ukraine was not in a good position in its negotiations with Russia over peace, that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=993.4000000000001s)]
*  it didn't have any cards. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=999.12s)]
*  And now Zelensky and Ukraine have orchestrated this pretty advanced attack after a long stretch [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1001.56s)]
*  where Russia was dominating the battlefield, right? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1008.1999999999999s)]
*  It's like he's saying, Zelensky saying, no, wait, we actually do have some cards. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  Here they are. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1017.52s)]
*  And so I'm wondering, Mark, how this affects the ongoing talks between Russia and Ukraine? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1018.72s)]
*  So first of all, you know, we talked about how this was a year and a half in the planning. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1026.96s)]
*  So while President Zelensky was in the Oval Office being berated, he knew that this plot [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1030.24s)]
*  was being cooked up. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1035.32s)]
*  So in any case, he knew he had some cards in his back pocket. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1037.24s)]
*  I think we talked a lot about what was Ukraine's goal with this operation. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1040.72s)]
*  And obviously, a central goal was to slow down these bombardments. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1044.64s)]
*  But there was a secondary goal, which was to raise the cost of this war for the Kremlin. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1048.52s)]
*  The Ukrainian theory of how do you stop this war is you have to force the Russians to stop. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1052.92s)]
*  Diplomacy has so far failed. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1057.28s)]
*  So the only way Ukraine sees this war ending is if there is enough pressure and cost on [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1058.8s)]
*  the Kremlin to end their war. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1064.04s)]
*  So this attack was a part of that. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1066.72s)]
*  And then we saw today, you know, another remarkable covert operation, which was the third attack [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1067.72s)]
*  on that bridge that crosses from Crimea into Russia. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1073.6s)]
*  Now, again, this one just happened literally, you know, this afternoon. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1076.6s)]
*  We don't know the damage. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1080.24s)]
*  We don't know how successful it was. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1081.24s)]
*  But it shows you what Ukraine's strategy here is, which is they're never going to have more [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1083.12s)]
*  people than Russia. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1087.12s)]
*  Russia is willing to lose tens of thousands of soldiers every month. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1088.28s)]
*  Ukraine has been most successful when they've used their ability to sort of act quickly. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  And whether it's surprise, deception, adaptation, that's where they've had the greatest success [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1098.2399999999998s)]
*  in this war. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1102.8s)]
*  And so this operation, going after these Russian bombers, going after the Crimean bridge again, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1103.8s)]
*  these play to Ukraine's strengths. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  At the same time, Putin obviously has been really resistant to pressure this whole time. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1110.9199999999998s)]
*  And I have to wonder whether even with the latest successes, this has any chance of working, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1118.08s)]
*  of forcing him to the table in a really earnest way. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1127.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1131.6s)]
*  All I know for sure is that nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1132.6s)]
*  They want this war to be over. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1136.24s)]
*  But none of us really know what will force Putin to stop this invasion and really either [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1138.04s)]
*  engage in good faith negotiations or agree to the immediate ceasefire that everyone, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1142.1999999999998s)]
*  quite frankly, Ukraine, the US, the Europeans all want. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1147.72s)]
*  And what we have instead, since this diplomatic push has sort of kicked into high gear after [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1151.64s)]
*  Trump took office, is no closer to peace, but more violent week after week. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1156.68s)]
*  In other words, Operation Spider's Web might end up having more of an effect on how we [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1162.8s)]
*  think about and conduct warfare in general than it will have on this actual war. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1168.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, obviously, everyone is always looking for that thing that will [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1177.24s)]
*  be the moment that turns the war or that leads to the end of the war. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1181.48s)]
*  But the honest truth is, you know, this is total war. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1186.3600000000001s)]
*  And in total war, it's everything together that matters. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1189.2800000000002s)]
*  So this operation will help people if it even, you know, lessens the bombardments to some [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1192.3600000000001s)]
*  degree that's thousands of people in a city or town who might not have to face a missile [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1197.96s)]
*  bombardment that otherwise would have come their way. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1203.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, at the end of the day, I think the Ukrainians are under no illusions. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1205.92s)]
*  This is their only strategy, which is to fight back, to increase the cost on the Kremlin [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1210.48s)]
*  and just hope at some point between their own actions, their own fight and then Western [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1216.4s)]
*  support, that that pressure becomes enough where Russia decides, OK, enough. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1221.64s)]
*  Mark, thanks for being here and stay safe. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1231.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1235.88s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1248.2800000000002s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1252.3600000000001s)]
*  On Tuesday morning, Israeli soldiers opened fire near crowds of Palestinians who were [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1254.48s)]
*  walking toward a food distribution site in southern Gaza. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1259.4s)]
*  The Red Cross said that 27 people were killed in the attack. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1263.72s)]
*  The Israeli military said it had fired near a few people who had strayed from the designated [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1267.84s)]
*  route to the site and who didn't respond to warning shots, saying they had, quote, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1272.52s)]
*  posed a threat to soldiers. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1277.4399999999998s)]
*  A senior administrator at a hospital a few miles from where the shootings took place [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1280.48s)]
*  said that many of the victims were children aged 10 to 13. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1284.84s)]
*  And the Trump administration is proposing a deal to allow Iran to continue enriching [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1288.68s)]
*  uranium at low levels, while the U.S. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1295.16s)]
*  and other countries work out a plan to eventually block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon in [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1298.0800000000002s)]
*  exchange for giving it access to fuel for nuclear power plants. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1304.0800000000002s)]
*  The proposal is seen as a bridge for now between the current situation of Iran rapidly [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1309.0s)]
*  producing near bomb grade uranium and the American goal of Iran enriching no uranium [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1315.24s)]
*  at all. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1320.88s)]
*  This was the first indication since Trump took office that the U.S. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1322.8000000000002s)]
*  and Iran might be able to find a compromise over Tehran's ambitions to build a nuclear [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1326.4s)]
*  weapon. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1332.0800000000002s)]
*  Officials in Tehran indicated that a response would come in several days. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1333.48s)]
*  And finally, on Tuesday afternoon, Elon Musk lashed out at a press conference in [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1339.72s)]
*  Washington, D.C. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1344.6s)]
*  where he said that the U.S. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1345.6s)]
*  has been cashed out against the ambitious Republican bill that's intended to enact [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1346.6s)]
*  Trump's domestic policy agenda and that's been backed by the president. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1351.4399999999998s)]
*  Musk posted on X that the measure, which the White House has called the big beautiful [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1356.52s)]
*  bill, is, quote, a disgusting abomination, saying it was, quote, massive, outrageous, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1361.32s)]
*  pork filled and would, quote, massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1367.6s)]
*  Musk also made efforts to unseat lawmakers who backed the bill in the 2026 midterm [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1374.6s)]
*  elections, saying, quote, in November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1379.8799999999999s)]
*  the American people. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1386.12s)]
*  While Musk directed his ire at Congress, the comments amounted to his biggest public break [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1388.28s)]
*  with Trump since the two joined forces during the campaign. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1393.24s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Olivia Natt, Caitlin O'Keefe and Anna Foley. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QuEsa78P5g&t=1398.9599999999998s)]
