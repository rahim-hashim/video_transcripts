# A Third Bank Implodes. Now What?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vARiIo3160)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. This is a daily.
*  On Monday morning, the federal government took over a third failing bank, this time
*  First Republic. Today, I speak with my colleague Gina Smilich about whether we're at the end
*  of this banking crisis or the start of a new phase of financial pain.
*  It's Tuesday, May 2nd.
*  So, Gina, another day, another bank failure.
*  Very much. And after these two banks had failed, Silicon Valley Bank, then a couple
*  days later, Signature Bank, the hope, and I'd say the expectation, was that this crisis
*  might be over. It was not over. In fact, a third bank, First Republic Bank, collapsed
*  and it was even bigger as a bank than the previous two that failed. So tell us about
*  why First Republic Bank ultimately went under.
*  I think that what happened at First Republic was sort of a slow motion reaction to what
*  happened at Silicon Valley Bank, that first bank that failed. So Silicon Valley, as you'll
*  remember, had planned pretty poorly for rising interest rates. It had to sell a bunch of
*  investments that had lost value as interest rates rose and that spooked customers. So
*  the customers pulled out their money in droves and that really caused its problems. So it
*  failed. Signature Bank, another bank in that sort of mid-sized region, which also had,
*  similar to Silicon Valley Bank, some exposures to interest rates and a lot of customers over
*  the $250,000 federal deposit insurance limit, also collapsed a few days later.
*  Right. And just to remind people why that $250,000 number matters, that's the point
*  at which if you fear your bank might fail, you're very worried about that money. You
*  should pull it out is the thinking, which actually becomes a self-reinforcing cycle
*  that leads to a run on a bank.
*  Yeah, exactly. If you have deposit under $250,000 at a bank, you don't really care if the bank
*  fails because the federal government is going to ensure that. Like your money's good. But
*  if you're above $250,000, the federal government doesn't ensure that. And so you are much more
*  likely to look around and feel a little nervous if your bank is doing anything funny and feel
*  like you need to run for the exits and make sure that money is safe. And so that's very
*  much what we saw with these two banks. So these first two banks fail and then people
*  are looking around to see who else is vulnerable.
*  Some investors now concerned about the health of First Republic, which also operates in
*  Silicon Valley.
*  And First Republic has a lot of shared characteristics with these other banks. And so what we start
*  to see is really an exodus of deposits from First Republic.
*  Tonight, a lifeline for First Republic.
*  And we see the big banks try and stop that actually.
*  11 of the country's biggest banks unveiling a rescue plan to pump $30 billion in deposits.
*  And so they pull together and inject $30 billion of cash into First Republic to try and say,
*  hey, it's safe. It's OK. It's going to make it through this period. We have confidence
*  in it. And so that basically served as a lifeline. It gave First Republic a few weeks to get
*  back on its feet. But that, unfortunately, did not work.
*  Tonight, we're getting our first glimpse of just how dangerously close to collapse First
*  Republic Bank has come.
*  So Monday of last week, they disclosed that a bunch of deposits had left.
*  The bank revealing that customers pulled more than $100 billion in deposits during the crisis.
*  That's a 41% drop. It is a staggering number.
*  $100 billion is out the door. Stock price, it just plunges all week long. It seems really
*  obvious that this bank is not going to make it.
*  Breaking news overnight, another American bank has failed. Just this morning, financial
*  regulators in California seized First Republic Bank. It marks the second largest bank to
*  fail in American history.
*  The Fed struck a deal to sell...
*  So we should think of what happened to First Republic as pretty similar to what happened
*  to Silicon Valley Bank and to Signature Bank, but just a slower motion failure. It took
*  longer, but it was more or less kind of the same.
*  Yeah, I think it was really sort of a chain reaction. It was the last domino to fall after
*  Silicon Valley Bank set off the cascading dominoes. But this was also a slightly different
*  situation. When it came to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the government swooped
*  in and backed up big depositors. In the case of First Republic, the government instead
*  immediately announced that it had arranged a shotgun marriage to JP Morgan Chase. And
*  so by selling it off to a private buyer, the government also managed to make sure that
*  depositors aren't going to lose their money. But it did it in a different way.
*  Got it. And you know, why would JP Morgan Chase want to buy a bank that is failing so
*  badly, losing money every single day?
*  Part of it is to protect the system, right? The fact that this bank was on its last legs
*  and that it might collapse and leave its depositors out in the cold is pretty nerve wracking for
*  the rest of the banking system. First Republic's a big bank, and if something goes wrong with
*  it, you could really see sort of panic moving all through the banking system. So this really
*  staves off that possibility. I think the other thing is a lot of the sort of assets on First
*  Republic's balance sheet, a lot of its loans, a lot of its, you know, sort of business isn't
*  actually all that bad looking. It just didn't hold up well in the face of rising interest
*  rates. And JP Morgan has also, in this case, got some guarantees from the government.
*  The government is going to share in losses on the portions of the business that aren't
*  looking so hot.
*  Now, does that mean that the government, and by that I mean you and me, the taxpayer, are
*  now subsidizing JP Morgan Chase's purchase of First Republic? So far, the government
*  has been careful to say that no taxpayer money is being used to bail out any of these
*  failing banks. So is that true in this case as well?
*  It is, but it's a little bit complicated. This deal is going to cost the government
*  about 13 billion dollars, which is going to be covered by the insurance fund that's paid
*  by every federally regulated bank. So it's not taxpayer money per se. But the banks will
*  tell you, and some people outside of the banks will tell you, that while this is paid for
*  by assessments on banks, at the end of the day, that comes back to hit the bank customers
*  because the banks are going to raise the money by charging more fees on mortgages, on bank
*  accounts, on things like that. And so it's possible that you'll still end up subsidizing
*  this, whether it's directly or not.
*  And even if you don't want to. So if you have any relationship with a federally regulated
*  bank, which almost all of us do, you're in one form or another eventually helping to
*  pay for this deal.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So if you're JP Morgan Chase, this is a pretty good deal, obviously. But there's something
*  a little bit funny about it, which is that JP Morgan Chase is already the nation's largest
*  And after the financial crisis in 2008, the whole idea was that big banks shouldn't get
*  any bigger, shouldn't be buying up their rivals because they might become too big to fail.
*  So this deal seemed kind of at odds with that.
*  So it is a little weird. I think the message we all took from 2008 was that really big
*  banks can be dangerous. And certainly that was baked into the legislation that we saw
*  passing after 2008. We saw a restriction that said the largest banks in America can no longer
*  acquire really big banks because we don't want too much of the nation's deposit base
*  concentrated at any one bank.
*  However, there was an exception to that rule. And the exception is that if a bank is failing,
*  a large bank can acquire it. And that's really what we saw come into play here. JP Morgan
*  was also able to offer the least cost option to acquire First Republic, and the government's
*  required to take the least cost option. And so ultimately, because of the exception, because
*  of the cost calculus, it was the bank that was chosen to take over First Republic.
*  Got it. So if this sounds like something that violates the 2008 principles, it's because
*  it did. But those 2008 principles had a little exception clause, and the situation just happens
*  to fit it.
*  We had an asterisk. This is the asterisk.
*  Okay. Well, while we're on the subject of 2008, the Times published data over the past
*  couple of days that kind of blew my mind. It found that during this latest banking crisis,
*  the banks that have failed so far held more assets than all of the banks that collapsed
*  in 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis. So given how costly this crisis has
*  already become, three bank failures into it, I wonder if we've now achieved a better
*  understanding of who is most responsible for this latest crisis, and whether it's the banks
*  or the regulators.
*  So these failures have been really big. At the same time, it's not 2008. It's not clear
*  that we're at the start of some sort of cascading financial crisis like we were back then. There
*  hasn't been the same kind of risk taking. We don't think we're not seeing that kind
*  of interconnected disaster. But it is clear that something went wrong here, that something
*  allowed these risks, these banks to sort of grow out of control to a point where they
*  could crash like this. So the government has started to take a look into what exactly that
*  something was. And we saw their first pass at that last week. They released some autopsies
*  into what happened at Silicon Valley Bank and at Signature Bank, who dropped the ball,
*  what happened. And the upshot from those is the government really took a finger and
*  pointed it right back at themselves.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Gina, why do these government autopsies point a finger so strongly right back at the regulators
*  themselves?
*  So we have these couple of reports that come out last week. And the one that I thought was
*  really interesting was this report that the Federal Reserve put out on Silicon Valley Bank.
*  This thing is hundreds of pages long. It's a ton of documents about what went wrong with
*  this bank's oversight, what regulators were seeing in real time, what supervisors were saying.
*  And a lot of this report sort of harkens back to a set of changes that you've discussed on
*  the show before, which is there were some pretty important regulatory rollbacks that happened in
*  2018 and 2019 that allowed banks to get a lot bigger before they were subject to the
*  government's strictest both regulations and supervision, so day-to-day oversight.
*  And Silicon Valley Bank was growing pretty rapidly in the years leading up to these reforms.
*  And because of them, it didn't move up into sort of big bank oversight, which tends to be a bit more
*  strenuous, a bit more professionalized, just a little bit more intensive all around until a
*  few years later than it otherwise would have.
*  Right. Before these regulatory rollbacks, Silicon Valley Bank would have been supervised more
*  strictly earlier, faster, with less money under management. But after these rollbacks, it just
*  took longer.
*  Exactly. And that mattered because some risks were able to sort of grow and metastasize and get worse
*  without a lot of intervention. And by the time they were recognized, it was pretty late in the game.
*  And what were some of the things these supervisors finally did find?
*  So the regulators, the supervisors, start really noticing that management has some pretty bad risk
*  management practices. They're really not minding their liquidity risk. And that means that they're
*  just not keeping sort of a good enough cushion in the case that something might go wrong.
*  But despite all of these findings, they're not really cracking down on this bank all that hard.
*  You know, what we saw was that they gave them a decent score on liquidity, again, that financial
*  cushion component of this, even after they had recognized some of this pretty significant risk
*  taking.
*  And how do you explain that? I mean, what is it that this report finds animates that decision to
*  say everything's okay or to let it slide when it looks problematic?
*  So this is alluded to a little bit in the report. But my reporting has also shown, I think, in a
*  little bit more depth, that it's pretty clearly the case that the supervisors who are overseeing
*  these institutions felt like you really couldn't crack down on an institution the first year that
*  it moved up into this stricter oversight regime. And so the delay that had happened earlier just
*  kind of cascaded through this bank's whole story and really resulted in even as recently as
*  2022, when it's really starting to get its wrist slapped for the first time, a pretty gentle
*  oversight regime that allowed a lot of problems to go unresolved.
*  Hmm. So what you're describing is a crucial set of years where Silicon Valley Bank doesn't get
*  regulated in the way it would have if these laws hadn't been rolled back. And then once it does
*  get regulated, the culture of people inside the Fed is to not be too hard on the new guy, the new
*  big bank. And so taking this all together, there's kind of, you know, a missed opportunity in these
*  two or three years to nip serious problems in the bud at Silicon Valley Bank.
*  Things went too slow. There was also just simply some plain old misdiagnosis that happened here.
*  So for example, one of the interesting documents showed that in the middle of 2021, some of the
*  supervisors watching over Silicon Valley Bank were worried about the possibility that they weren't
*  properly protected in the case that interest rates fell, that interest rates went down,
*  which is interesting because by the middle of 2021, inflation had started to pick up.
*  And so increasingly the risk by that point was that interest rates would increase, which we saw
*  them do in 2022. You know, the Federal Reserve within a few months of that had started raising
*  interest rates. And so not only was the bank not properly prepared for that, but it seems like maybe
*  the supervisors weren't aware that they needed to be taking that risk into account. They were focused
*  on the wrong risk as it turned out. Exactly. So I think what happened here was sort of this cocktail
*  of actual regulatory changes, a fairly lax supervisory culture and just plain old, you know,
*  boring mistakes. Which you're saying when they're finally all brought together in this cocktail,
*  ultimately lead to Silicon Valley Bank having so much risk that it fails and that that failure
*  brings us to where we are right now, which is the failure not just of Silicon Valley Bank,
*  but of Signature and now of First Republic. Exactly. But ultimately, Gina, these banks,
*  the three of them that we've been talking about, made decisions that caused their own failures.
*  And one of the common threads for all three of them was that they were focused on customers,
*  depositors who had a lot of money to put in these banks. And because they had so much money in the
*  bank, that put the whole bank at a higher risk of a bank run because these people worried that
*  anything over $250,000 wasn't going to be insured by the federal government. So I wonder if these
*  banks could have on their own really lowered their risk of being in the situation they're now in
*  by just having a more balanced group of clients the way that the big banks do.
*  You know, people with a lot less money could be their customers too.
*  You know, I think anytime you have a bank failure, you have clearly had a failure of bank management,
*  like bank managers are supposed to make sure that their banks aren't vulnerable to failing.
*  But at the end of the day, what you just explained is really a situation of sort of concentrated
*  risk. There's nothing wrong with having big customers. There's nothing wrong with having
*  uninsured deposits. The problem is when you don't have enough of a variety of customers,
*  when you're not thinking about making sure that you're balancing all of your risk, which is what
*  happened, particularly in the case of Silicon Valley Bank. And those kinds of problems, those
*  sort of gaping vulnerabilities are the kinds of things that regulation is supposed to catch.
*  So I spent a lot of time talking about this with my sources over recent weeks,
*  and I'll often say, you know, I'm getting told that a lot of this was the fault of the managers,
*  and they will say back to me, of course it was the fault of the managers. But this is why we have
*  regulation. Regulation is supposed to step in where CEOs fail. And there's a reason we do this
*  to banks in particular, right? You know, we don't regulate everything like this. Your local toy
*  store is not regulated the way a bank would be regulated. It's because these banks are the
*  beating heart of the center of our economy. They have such big knock on effects when something
*  goes wrong. And so we as a nation, as sort of a society have decided that it's really important
*  to make sure that we're keeping an eye on these folks.
*  Gina, where do we now go from here? Because this now feels like a crisis that in terms of dollars
*  is significant. We talked about that. And yet it's oddly contained as banking crises go.
*  And perhaps that's because these are regional banks and lots and lots of people were untouched by
*  these collapses. You know, 2008 touched everybody because it was so interconnected with the entire
*  economy, as you said. But if you bank a Bank of America or Wells Fargo or Chase right now,
*  what happened at these three banks doesn't really affect you that much. And it kind of feels like
*  we might now be at the end of whatever this set of dominoes was, right? Is that how you see this?
*  I think that's the optimistic take is that this could be the end of it. Stick a fork in it,
*  we're past this. I think there's a more nuanced take, one that an economist described to me this
*  morning, which is that we might be past the acute phase of this situation. You know, the bank
*  failures that we were going to see in response to SVB are now behind us. But we might be moving into
*  the chronic phase. And the chronic phase here has a lot to do with the interest rate increases we've
*  seen over the last year and a half. When interest rates go up, it tends to displace other parts of
*  financial markets. It tends to sort of show us where the weaknesses are. We pretty clearly saw
*  that in the case of these banks. Silicon Valley Bank was very exposed to rising interest rates
*  in a way that it hadn't handled well. And that's a big portion of why it failed. And so the Fed is
*  set to meet on Wednesday, and it's expected to raise interest rates again. That might be its last
*  interest rate increase in this cycle. They've suggested that they might hit pause after that,
*  we don't know for sure. But regardless, rates are a lot higher than they've been in a really long
*  time. And we could have more weaknesses out there that we just haven't recognized yet.
*  You know, there's this phrase that you often hear in finance, which is,
*  when interest rates rise, the tide goes out and you see who's swimming naked.
*  And I think we've seen a couple of the people who are swimming naked, but the tide's not all the
*  way out yet. So we might still see more to come. There may be additional vulnerabilities.
*  More naked banks. Exactly.
*  Well, Gina, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Monday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said
*  the United States could run out of money to pay its bills by June 1st if Congress fails to raise
*  or suspend the debt ceiling. That deadline, which is earlier than previously forecast,
*  will put pressure on President Biden and House Republicans to reach a swift agreement to avoid
*  a financial disaster. House Republicans say they will not raise the debt ceiling unless Biden
*  agrees to deep spending cuts and rollbacks to some of his signature legislation,
*  conditions that Biden has rejected. And the U.S. now estimates that at least 100,000 Russian fighters
*  have been killed or wounded in Ukraine since December, a staggering measure of the war's toll
*  on Russia's military. According to the U.S., Russian casualties have accelerated over the
*  past few months because it sent waves of poorly trained recruits to the front lines.
*  The U.S. did not disclose comparable estimates for the Ukrainian military.
