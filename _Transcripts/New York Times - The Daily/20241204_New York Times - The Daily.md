# Two Billionaires’ Big Plan to Shrink Government
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTyCKGYG89M)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  Your money is being wasted and the Department of Government and Divisions is going to fix
*  that.
*  Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have called the federal bureaucracy a quote, existential threat
*  to our republic.
*  We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook.
*  Now, President-elect Trump is empowering them to drastically shrink it by whatever means
*  necessary.
*  America is going to reach heights that it has never seen before.
*  The future is going to be amazing.
*  Today, my colleague David Ferenfold examines their plans and what it would look like if
*  they actually carried them out.
*  It's Wednesday, December 4th.
*  So David, you've been doing some reporting on plans by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy
*  to cut government to the tune of $2 trillion.
*  You're trying to understand exactly what this effort is and how it would work.
*  Tell me what you're finding.
*  Well, we're talking about this thing called the Department of Government Efficiency.
*  Those of you who are on the Internet may know that that's a meme.
*  It's named after a funny dog meme that Elon Musk likes.
*  And a cryptocurrency apparently.
*  And a cryptocurrency that's named after the funny dog meme.
*  Now, there's no thing in the government called the Department of Government Efficiency, but
*  it is something that President Trump has pledged to set up once he takes office.
*  And what they're talking about is kind of a hybrid setup where there would be people
*  outside the government, Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, these sort of advisors on the outside
*  taking no government salary, holding no government position.
*  And then a bunch of folks on the inside, people who actually would work for the government.
*  Musk has described them as sort of committed, smart government, you know, budget cutters.
*  And together, their goal is pretty massive.
*  They talked about, as you said, cutting about $2 trillion in the federal budget.
*  You know, numbers like that can get kind of abstract with that size.
*  But what that really means is about a third of the federal budget they want to cut.
*  And they also want to make huge cuts to regulation, to the number of regulations, to the size
*  of the regulatory state.
*  Now, it's important to note that there is fat in the federal government.
*  There is potentially room to cut it.
*  But the thing they're taking on, it's really not just in numbers, but in sort of effort,
*  is going to be a massive task.
*  So basically very, very big promises.
*  But you know, to be kind of real about this, I think anyone who stood in line, the DMV
*  could get behind the idea that a more efficient government, as they say that they want to
*  make, makes sense.
*  I mean, you know, efficiency is a hard concept to argue with, right?
*  Right.
*  It's hard to argue with the idea that those government processes could be made more efficient.
*  And on paper, Elon Musk is a really good person to put in charge of efficiency.
*  He has many areas of success.
*  But the thing that he has done best over his career is process engineering, taking a process
*  like assembling a car, assembling a rocket, building a thing and making that process run
*  faster, smoother, cheaper.
*  I mean, the way he changed the assembly process for Teslas particularly, and for SpaceX, there's
*  a reason why his companies build those things faster than others.
*  So he is a great expert in efficiency, at least in that kind of efficiency, sort of
*  manufacturing efficiency.
*  In fact, this whole thing, the whole doge, I mean, as you could probably tell from the
*  name, this is Elon's idea.
*  Donald, great, great to to speak.
*  And there was actually a recording of it happening.
*  Congratulations.
*  Musk is interviewing Trump in August on X, Musk's social media platform.
*  I mean, I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that
*  takes a look at these things.
*  And Musk says, hey, you know, I think we should have this commission.
*  And I'd be happy to help out on such a commission.
*  I'd love it.
*  If it were full.
*  Well, you, you're the greatest cutter.
*  I mean, I look at what you do, you walk in and you just say, you want to quit?
*  They go on strike.
*  I won't mention the name.
*  Then Trump says, oh, yeah, sure, we'll do that.
*  So this is Musk's idea.
*  And so he's the one who sort of planted this idea.
*  And he's really focused on it since Trump was elected.
*  I appreciate it.
*  I'll see you soon.
*  All right.
*  Sounds good.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Elon.
*  Thank you very much.
*  And then Vivek Ramaswamy, this partner in this, is somebody who briefly ran for president,
*  it seems like a million years ago, but a year ago was running for president.
*  And he talked a lot on the campaign trail about also cutting government, how to make
*  government smaller.
*  So they're really focused on this idea of efficiency.
*  But listen, the question for all of us looking at this effort is, what do they mean by efficiency?
*  That's an easy question to define when we're talking about making a car.
*  But what exactly does it mean when you're talking about government?
*  Right.
*  Like how do these two people take the private sector idea of efficiency of this process
*  engineering and map it on to the federal government?
*  There are, of course, risks to this, right?
*  I mean, if you make a mistake at Twitter and it goes offline for a day, not really that
*  big of a deal.
*  But if you do it with air traffic controllers, planes could collide.
*  So what's the plan here?
*  So it seems to me, honestly, like they are still figuring this out themselves.
*  But to the degree that we know their plan, they spelled that out in an op-ed in the Wall
*  Street Journal last month.
*  And they laid out a few different ways that they say they would go about sort of beginning
*  to identify and then make the right cuts.
*  The sort of theme underlying it all was that government is run by what they call unelected
*  bureaucrats, meaning federal workers.
*  They're going to find a way to take power back from those folks and return it to the
*  people.
*  Which is kind of a little rich.
*  I mean, power back to the people.
*  It's basically to them, right?
*  So power back to the business people.
*  Right.
*  We're in a situation where a couple of very rich people are sort of putting themselves
*  in the place of identifying what the people want.
*  Right.
*  But they are working for a president who just won.
*  So maybe they have a little more claim to it now than they would have a few months ago.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  So what are they actually saying?
*  What are they going to do?
*  Well, there's a few different ways they're going about this.
*  But the most important thing I think we need to start with is the idea that they want to
*  cut regulations first, federal rules first.
*  And that once you cut rules, then you can start to cut people and spending.
*  And the way that they're going to start by cutting rules is using a Supreme Court decision
*  called Loper-Brite.
*  It basically strikes down something called Chevron deference.
*  We're deep in the legal weeds here, but this is important.
*  OK.
*  So the reason it's called Chevron is it's named after a case in which Chevron was a
*  party back in the 80s.
*  And the idea that the Supreme Court laid out in the 80s was that if a federal agency makes
*  a rule, it takes an idea that Congress laid out and then sort of makes it more specific,
*  promulgates a rule for people to abide by.
*  If somebody challenges that rule and says, hey, this rule is wrong or it doesn't comport
*  with what Congress wanted, that the court should defer to the judgment of the agency.
*  The idea being that the agency has experts that they may know better than the courts,
*  that they should defer to the judgment of the agency unless it's really egregious.
*  So the power of the federal government is kind of present there because the court defers
*  to what the federal agency says the rule is.
*  But SCOTUS changed that in the past few terms.
*  They did.
*  So the Supreme Court got rid of that.
*  And what they said instead was, no, courts should just be able to use their own judgment.
*  Agencies don't deserve any sort of special deference.
*  That if somebody challenges a rule in court, that the court should be able to use their
*  own judgment about whether that rule was reasonable or not without going from a starting point
*  that the agency might be right.
*  So the way that Musk and Rameswami want to use this is to say, okay, well, now we're
*  going to go back into federal government and with the help of the folks who work inside
*  government, we're going to identify a whole bunch of rules that we believe are wrong.
*  Now that we think there's more freedom to challenge federal rules, we're going to find
*  all kinds of federal rules we think are overreaching or don't follow the original intent of Congress
*  or unconstitutional.
*  And we're just going to start identifying those and tell President Trump, hey, stop
*  enforcing these rules.
*  Don't enforce them.
*  And we'll start the formal process to take them off the books.
*  And that once you stop enforcing rules and start taking those rules off the books, their
*  idea is, well, you won't need as many federal workers to enforce those rules because there's
*  less rules to enforce.
*  And you won't need as much spending because there'll be fewer workers to pay for.
*  So basically, their argument is that they have this magic wand that they can just wave
*  and stop enforcing federal regulations.
*  What else do they say they're going to do?
*  That was sort of the main thrust, the idea that you cut regulations first and other cuts
*  are downstream of that.
*  But they had a couple other ideas for cutting the federal workforce.
*  And their plans here really kind of run the gamut.
*  They refer to a plan where the president could just lay off huge numbers of federal employees
*  across the board.
*  There are civil service protections that prevent individual employees from being fired for
*  their political beliefs or other reasons.
*  But they believe the president could just simply shut down an agency.
*  They also float some kind of more creative efforts that would make employees quit so
*  they wouldn't have to be fired.
*  One is to make federal workers come back into the office five days a week, ending what they
*  call the sort of unnecessary post-COVID privileges.
*  And the other was to relocate federal agencies out of Washington.
*  I think about 85% of federal workers don't work in Washington, but there are a lot obviously
*  who are here in Washington where I am.
*  President Trump can use executive action to say, okay, the headquarters of this agency
*  is no longer Washington, it's somewhere else.
*  And trust that a lot of people won't want to relocate and so the federal workforce will
*  decline in the process of moving them.
*  Got it.
*  And then finally, they say they want to look around the federal government to cut wasteful
*  spending.
*  That means both cutting entire programs, spending programs that they don't agree with.
*  It also means trying to make existing programs like Medicare or the Pentagon run more efficiently
*  by finding and cutting waste or fraud.
*  Okay, so it sounds like, and I bet, right?
*  Here's how I'll cut the federal government in five easy steps.
*  It'll be so quick, so easy.
*  It's funny you say that.
*  Actually, Fox News interviewed Elon Musk's mom, May Musk.
*  May, it's great to have you with us.
*  It's great to be here because I watch your show.
*  Who has been sitting in some of these meetings.
*  His mom.
*  Elon Musk's mom is part of this and she was saying, he wants to chop the bureaucracy.
*  I take it he's excited about doing that, isn't he?
*  Very excited because it's going to be very easy.
*  It's going to be so easy.
*  It's going to be so easy to do.
*  And I'm very proud of him.
*  There was actually another element of this.
*  Vivek Ramaswamy posted a picture on Instagram over Thanksgiving with like one of his kids
*  napping in his lap and he's reading a report on how to cut the federal budget.
*  So, you know, the vibe from them has been this is going to be fun.
*  This is going to be easy.
*  It's going to be bigger than you think.
*  You know, just we can't wait to get started and we're going to make such huge progress.
*  But we have seen lots of administrations try this.
*  And honestly, the history of just this one idea about how to cut the budget, which is
*  you get some very successful businessmen from outside the government, bring them in and
*  help them, you know, with their fresh eyes, they'll see how to run government like a
*  business.
*  The first person to do that was Theodore Roosevelt.
*  Ronald Reagan made a big effort led by this industrialist named Peter Grace.
*  He had this huge commission that produced like 2500 separate recommendations to cut
*  the budget.
*  More recently, we had Al Gore trying to reinvent government in the 90s.
*  And then, you know, I was covering Congress in 2010, 11, 12, when the Tea Party wave of
*  Republicans came in, they were all about cutting the budget, getting the government down to
*  the right size.
*  It's been tried again and again and again in the last 100 plus years.
*  And often it doesn't happen.
*  Now, there are reasons to think this time might be different.
*  There's never been anybody like Elon Musk at the head of one of these commissions.
*  Nobody is rich or powerful.
*  Nobody is close to the president.
*  So those are all reasons to think that Doge is going to have more luck than these other
*  previous efforts.
*  That said, it's pretty clear that Doge is about to run into some pretty big hurdles
*  of its own.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, you said that many past presidential administrations have tried but failed to do
*  what Doge is attempting.
*  Tell me about the obstacles that these two are likely to run into.
*  Well, I think the best way to start, Elon Musk, because he wants to cut $2 trillion
*  out of the 6 point something trillion federal budget, so about a third of the federal budget.
*  If you zoom out, think about what are the biggest chunks of the federal budget?
*  Where does that money go?
*  And the first is about a third of the budget goes to two programs, Medicare and Social
*  Security, two programs that provide income security and health care for older Americans.
*  Now, those are things that Republicans have targeted a lot in the past.
*  Remember the Paul Ryan years.
*  A lot of people wanted to cut Medicare and Social Security.
*  Trump's innovation, the thing that he did that no other Republican did was he said,
*  no, we'll never cut those things.
*  In fact, it says it in the Republican Party platform this year, Medicare and Social Security
*  will not be touched.
*  So you're putting those two giant programs off the table.
*  They're not going to be touched.
*  So, okay, a third of the federal budget already off limits.
*  That's right.
*  And beyond that, if we put Medicare and Social Security off to the side, we're not going
*  to touch those.
*  Another big chunk, about 13% of the budget goes to national defense.
*  And that's all the armed forces, all the contracts to people who supply things for the armed
*  forces, which, by the way, includes Elon Musk's SpaceX.
*  So they have contracts to shoot satellites up in the air for the Air Force.
*  Right.
*  So it's really unlikely that Trump is going to make major cuts in that area.
*  And if you look at his governing record from his first administration, the military budget
*  went way up and Trump tried to make it go higher than even than it did.
*  So he's somebody who has said a lot.
*  He wants the military to be strong.
*  He wants to spend a lot of the military.
*  I don't sense a lot of appetite from him to shrink the military budget in any sort of
*  significant way.
*  Nor presumably would Musk want to cut contracts that he himself receives from the federal
*  government. That is also part of this.
*  So what else are we talking about here that's off limits?
*  Well, it's important to note that we are running huge budget deficits as a country and that
*  a lot of the federal budget, about 10%, is just paying interest on money we already borrowed.
*  So nobody's excited about this spending.
*  Nobody gets any benefit out of this spending.
*  But we already agreed to pay these debts.
*  And if you stopped paying interest now, you'd save a lot of money for about five minutes
*  and then then the country would default and interest rates would go up and the economy
*  would be shattered. It would not help any of Trump's political goals to stop paying
*  interest on the debt.
*  OK, so more than half of the budget is essentially off limits right off the bat.
*  What does that leave for this Department of Government Efficiency to actually cut?
*  Well, in theory, it gives them a still pretty broad range of things to cut within the
*  federal government. The part that remains outside those programs we talked about earlier
*  is everything from Medicaid and veterans benefits to the State Department, to the
*  Education Department.
*  You know, there's a lot of different federal agencies and federal programs that in theory
*  could be out there to be cut.
*  But the problem they're going to run into is Congress.
*  That's the problem these efforts always run into.
*  The reason the government spends money on these things in the first place is because
*  Congress told them to. And so now to cut them, you need Congress to undo that effort.
*  And sometimes that happens. But what has been proven again and again is that even
*  small, seemingly small programs have a constituency in Congress.
*  And you're going to need those folks to sign off to get rid of them.
*  And often it doesn't happen.
*  You know, I covered the Tea Party Congress in 2010, 2011, 2012, when there was a huge
*  amount of effort. There'd been this big wave in Congress, all these people elected to
*  cut the budget. They were explicitly running on the idea that budget was too big.
*  We have to cut things back.
*  And one of the things I did at that time was write about these tiny little programs that
*  seemed like the easiest possible things to cut.
*  What's an example?
*  Well, so my favorite one was the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.
*  Sheep as in sheep the animal.
*  Sheep to improve the sheep.
*  It paid for sort of contests that rewarded people who were good at shearing sheep for
*  trips for people in the sheep industry to take trips around the country.
*  Definitely seems non-essential.
*  Yeah, it's like a million dollars.
*  So it was sort of like, you know, in theory, the easiest thing to cut.
*  And so at the time I was writing about this congressman from Florida, the Republican from
*  Florida, it was sort of like a Mr.
*  Smith goes to Washington thing, except the stakes were much, much smaller.
*  He just wanted to get rid of the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.
*  OK, but they were people who really like the Sheep Improvement Center, the places that
*  have a lot of sheep, Texas, Montana.
*  They like the money. And why wouldn't, you know, if they're going to be giving out money to
*  everything else, why wouldn't they fight for some of that money to come to this industry
*  they care about in their state?
*  And so it didn't work. He failed.
*  So even the lowest hanging fruit, the thing you think nobody would miss, somebody
*  would miss it. And it didn't go away.
*  So you can't cut the Sheep Improvement Center from the federal budget.
*  You're probably not going to be able to cut a big hunk out of, say, Veterans Affairs.
*  No, even the Education Department.
*  You know, that's been something that's been identified as like, well, obviously we got to cut the
*  Education Department. But a lot of what it does is provide grants to schools, school
*  districts and schools all over the country.
*  And so there's a lot of people on both sides of the aisle that like it because the people in their
*  district benefit from it and don't want to lose that aid.
*  Right. So I'm not saying this to tell you that it's impossible to cut the budget or the
*  budget shouldn't be cut.
*  I'm just saying that it's not one fight.
*  It's a million little fights.
*  And if you're going to cut the budget on a broad scale, you have to not only find these
*  programs, but also find and convince or bully the people in your way, the people that are
*  defending these programs into letting them go.
*  So even the stuff that seems, quote unquote, easy is a lot of work.
*  And it's presumably much harder if you're an outsider and not an insider who knows how
*  Congress works.
*  Absolutely right. And that has been the downfall of these outsider efforts in the past is that
*  they don't really understand how Congress works and that they want congressmen to act against
*  their own interests. And it's even more difficult now in a Congress that is so narrowly
*  divided where only a few votes going the other way could doom any idea.
*  So it's very hard to cut government programs.
*  You have shown that amply.
*  But beyond the programs, what about cutting the federal workforce itself?
*  We first need to know sort of the size of the federal workforce.
*  It's about two point three million civilian employees.
*  That sounds like a lot, but it hasn't actually changed that much in decades.
*  What has changed is the number of outside contractors that do work for the federal government.
*  If you come here to D.C., that's what's transformed the D.C.
*  area, brought all this wealth to the D.C.
*  area is there's a huge numbers of federal contractors doing all kinds of federal jobs, sometimes
*  jobs that seem like they should be done, you know, sort of clerical office work jobs that
*  should be done by the agencies themselves.
*  So that makes it a hard problem.
*  It's not just that you can shut down this department as hard as that would be.
*  If you're going to really shrink the amount of money you spend on federal workers, you're
*  going to have to go through the hard work of auditing contracts, figuring out which
*  ones are duplicative, which ones you actually need.
*  Right. Now, this is an area where I think Musk and
*  Rameswamy have not really answered a basic question, which is why are you cutting the
*  federal workforce? Are you doing it because you want to save money?
*  Is that the goal? Are you doing it because you want to reduce sort of the deep state,
*  the liberal influence over Washington?
*  Are you doing it because you think the government does things that it shouldn't do?
*  This is how far apart those two are.
*  Musk has been calling out on his Twitter account individual government employees who he
*  thinks their jobs are too woke.
*  And look at this person who works for this department on this woke thing.
*  They shouldn't work for the government anymore.
*  But firing that person is not going to change the federal budget in any meaningful way.
*  Right. So you're maybe following your political agenda, but you're not really doing the
*  main work, which is making government more efficient.
*  You're not going to cut two trillion dollars firing one person at a time.
*  Rameswamy, on the other hand, has been sort of like the machete approach to government.
*  He's talked about we should fire everybody who works for the government whose social
*  security number ends in an odd number.
*  So just like one of those dramas where everybody just vanishes one day, like, you know,
*  like it's like a rapture.
*  We're going to rapture the government employees and one day only half of them will be
*  there. So there's no sense that we're going to continue delivering the same services.
*  It just let's cut for cutting sake.
*  So until the two of them can get on the same page about what they're cutting and why
*  they're cutting, it does leave some questions about their ability to deliver any sort of
*  significant reduction to the federal workforce.
*  OK, so bottom line, very difficult to make cuts anywhere near the scale that Musk is
*  talking about. Cutting the budget and even the size of the federal workforce will be
*  very hard. But what about this idea of reducing government regulation?
*  This is clearly what animates Musk.
*  That's what got Musk into this.
*  He runs a lot of businesses that are regulated by the federal government.
*  He regards a lot of those regulations as standing in his way, standing in the way of
*  progress. He often says standing in the way of getting humanity to Mars.
*  And when he talks about, you know, what will this DOGE committee do, he often talks
*  about things that affect him personally.
*  You know, I'd like to get rid of this regulation that slows down my rocket launches or
*  that inhibits this tunnel I'm digging somewhere.
*  So, you know, I'm not saying that he gets into this only to sort of clear the way for
*  his businesses. But when he talks about what makes him mad about government and why he's
*  so animated about this, it's clearly the regulations that impact him.
*  So that makes sense for him to say regulations is the place we're going to start.
*  So remember that so much of their plan revolves around using this court case that ended
*  what we called Chevron deference.
*  Right. And so their argument here is that now there's all this new power in the executive
*  branch to basically stop enforcing rules you don't agree with.
*  But the problem with that argument is that according to the legal experts we've talked
*  to is it is 100 percent wrong.
*  OK, how?
*  Well, remember that the essence of that decision was it took power that had been given to
*  the executive branch, the federal agencies, and gave it to the courts.
*  The courts now have the power to strike down these regulations if they feel like they
*  have overstepped the bounds.
*  Right. And they don't have to defer to the federal government.
*  Exactly. It doesn't do anything to say that the federal executive branch can decide to
*  do that. In fact, it takes power away from them.
*  So basically, they're claiming a right and a power not to enforce regulations that is
*  nowhere in that court decision.
*  And in fact, they probably have less power to ignore rules or reinterpret rules than
*  they did before, because that power is now in the courts.
*  Right. I do think that that court case will lead to a lot more deregulation, but it's
*  going to happen slowly.
*  One court case at a time is courts sort of roll back those rules.
*  It's not going to happen all at once because the president decides he doesn't want to
*  start enforcing rules he doesn't like.
*  So their central argument of how they're going to pull off this efficiency thing kind of
*  doesn't hold water.
*  That's right. They have lofty ambitions.
*  They have a lot of confidence and they have some very high level ideas about what they
*  want to cut. But this is not something that can be done with high level ideas.
*  This is going to take a lot of detailed, focused effort, a lot of political effort.
*  And we haven't seen yet that those elements are present.
*  And of course, do they even agree among themselves on all of this stuff?
*  I mean, as you described here, it doesn't sound like they're all going to be rowing
*  in the same direction.
*  Look, I think the most important thing to remember about all this is the finite quality
*  of all this is going to be attention and energy, both Musk's energy, Ramaswamy's energy,
*  probably most importantly, Donald Trump's energy.
*  Remember, when Trump takes office, he's promised to do all kinds of things that are going
*  to be disruptive in Washington.
*  They're going to produce controversy and they're going to take energy, time and effort
*  to make work. He's talked about mass deportation.
*  A deportation like we haven't seen in decades.
*  He's talked about tariffs, huge tariffs on a lot of different countries and possibly
*  trade deals. There's a lot of disruption, he's promised.
*  And in among all this, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are going to try to make a very
*  disruptive change in the size of the federal government.
*  The question for me is when the rubber hits the road on these cuts, when they recommend
*  big cuts to different agencies or to things that congressmen want to fight for, is Trump
*  going to have the energy and the inclination to join that fight, to lend him some of his
*  presidential energy and power, or is he going to be focused on other things?
*  But as you said, we do have a budget deficit crisis.
*  The country could benefit from addressing it.
*  This is a hugely important conversation.
*  Just in the last few years, we've added 12 trillion dollars to the national debt.
*  We spend, as I said, more than 10 percent of the federal budget every year just paying
*  off the debt for money we already borrowed.
*  Whatever you think the size of the federal budget ought to be, I think the country would
*  benefit from a real serious, significant conversation about what it spends money on
*  and an effort to try to make that more efficient, to try to spend the least you can to
*  get the services you want.
*  So given all of that, David, what's the best case scenario here?
*  I mean, in terms of what DOGE might actually get done?
*  I think the best case scenario is that Elon Musk really dives into one of these really
*  thorny, ugly, complicated federal government bureaucracies and finds a way to make
*  it more efficient. Think about, you know, finding waste in Medicare where there's, you
*  know, billions of dollars lost to waste.
*  Think about auditing the Pentagon, although the Pentagon is one of its customers.
*  But if there was a way to sort of shrink the wasted money and duplication at the
*  Pentagon, you could really make a huge difference, not just in the budget, but at the
*  functioning of the federal government.
*  I think that's the best case scenario is that someone really digs into one of these
*  supposedly unsolvable problems that make the government so big and inefficient.
*  But the worst case scenario here is that Trump or Musk get distracted.
*  They get bogged down.
*  They don't change very much, but the small things they do change, they make a huge deal
*  out of. And people see that, see, you know, a cut of a few million dollars here, even a
*  few billion dollars here.
*  Things that sound big, but are actually pretty small in the context of the federal
*  government, that they see those kind of changes.
*  And they think, oh, the problem was fixed.
*  Donald Trump fixed this problem.
*  When in reality, the problem wasn't fixed.
*  It was solved.
*  In reality, the problem wasn't fixed.
*  It was just sort of kicked down the road for somebody else to deal with.
*  In other words, this just becomes another chapter in the government's struggle to
*  contain the problem.
*  That's right.
*  David, thank you.
*  Thanks for having me on.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today.
*  South Korea, one of America's closest allies in Asia, descended into political chaos on
*  Tuesday after its president, Yoon Suk-yul, imposed martial law.
*  And then just hours later, the country's National Assembly, in a swift rebuke to the
*  president, voted to lift it.
*  Yoon, a deeply unpopular and divisive leader, accused the opposition of, quote, trying to
*  overthrow democracy.
*  It was the first time a South Korean president had declared martial law since the military
*  dictatorship ended in the country in the late 1980s.
*  The move drew peaceful protests in Seoul, the capital, and over the course of a tense
*  night, eventually backfired.
*  Before the sun rose on Wednesday morning, the president had backed down and rescinded
*  his martial law declaration.
*  And Donald Trump's transition team announced that it had belatedly signed an agreement
*  with the Department of Justice that will allow the FBI to conduct background checks on people
*  Trump intends to appoint as senior officials in his new administration.
*  FBI background checks have long been a routine part of transitions.
*  But Trump, who is hostile to the FBI because of its role in various criminal and counterintelligence
*  investigations into him, had let weeks pass without signing the agreement.
