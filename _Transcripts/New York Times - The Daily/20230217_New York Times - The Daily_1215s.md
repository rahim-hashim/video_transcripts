Video Description: The Biden administration said this week that it would end the public health emergency for Covid, a sign that federal officials believe that the pandemic has moved into a new, less dire phase.


The move carries both symbolic weight and real-world consequences for millions of Americans.


Guest: Apoorva Mandavilli (https://www.nytimes.com/by/apoorva-mandavilli) , a science and global health reporter for The New York Times.


Background reading: 

  •  The end of the public health emergency, planned for May, will bring about a complex set of policy changes and signals a new stage (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/us/politics/biden-covid-public-health-emergency.html)  in the government’s pandemic response.
  •  Among the effects of the change (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/well/live/covid-public-health-emergency.html) , access to tests and treatment will be more complicated.

# The End of the Pandemic Emergency in the U.S.
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=0.0s)]
*  The Biden administration said this week it would end the public health emergency for [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=10.76s)]
*  COVID, closing this chapter of the pandemic three years after it started. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=14.52s)]
*  Today, my colleague Apurva Mandeville explains how it will affect Americans and why it does [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=19.56s)]
*  not mean the end of COVID. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=25.92s)]
*  It's Friday, February 3rd. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=32.88s)]
*  So Apurva, the Biden administration announced that the public health emergency around COVID [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  is ending. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=48.32000000000001s)]
*  Can you explain what that means? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so almost exactly three years ago, when the pandemic started, on January 31st. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=51.88s)]
*  Well, good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=59.2s)]
*  I have today declared that the coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=61.2s)]
*  United States. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=66.0s)]
*  Alex Azar, who was then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that we were now [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=67.0s)]
*  in a public health emergency. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=71.92s)]
*  In accordance with the declaration, the United States government will implement temporary [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=73.9s)]
*  measures to increase our abilities to detect and contain the coronavirus proactively and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=78.98s)]
*  aggressively. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=84.66s)]
*  And that was an acknowledgement that the virus was spreading in the country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=86.06s)]
*  And a public health emergency, which is something that the government does every once in a while [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=90.42s)]
*  when there is one, allows the government to do a lot of different things to cope with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=93.66s)]
*  this special situation. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=98.5s)]
*  And since January 2020, this public health emergency has been renewed every 90 days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=101.98s)]
*  But now the Biden administration is saying that that emergency is over and that all of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=107.46s)]
*  those special things that we did will end on May 11th. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=112.3s)]
*  So the Biden administration is basically letting this declaration of a health emergency expire, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=116.13999999999999s)]
*  right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=120.86s)]
*  But what exactly had this declaration been allowing? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=121.86s)]
*  Like how have we been seeing it play out in our everyday lives? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  For the average person, what it did most importantly is it gave us access to free tests, free treatments, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=129.62s)]
*  free vaccines. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=135.7s)]
*  It allowed states, hospitals, nursing homes, various parts of the federal government to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=136.9s)]
*  deal with COVID outside of the usual framework. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=141.26s)]
*  It also gave them extra money. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=145.26s)]
*  And Medicare and other group health plans were covering out of network as if it were [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=147.7s)]
*  in network. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=151.78s)]
*  Meaning? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=152.78s)]
*  Meaning you could go to any doctor and be treated and you would be treated for free. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=153.78s)]
*  And the federal government barred states from kicking anybody off of Medicaid for the rest [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=157.98s)]
*  of the pandemic. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=162.78s)]
*  I mean, it basically gave the federal government extra muscle to deal with a disaster that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=163.9s)]
*  was unfolding all around us, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=168.46s)]
*  Like lessening all the friction in the system so that we could all get care more easily. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=170.58s)]
*  Yeah, and it gave a lot of extra money and people power and made it possible for private [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=175.34s)]
*  entities and government entities to really fight the pandemic on every front. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=181.66s)]
*  And now that's all going away. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=185.9s)]
*  That's not all going away. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=187.5s)]
*  But yes, some of it is going away as of May 11th. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=188.94s)]
*  Anupurva, what does that mean? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=192.7s)]
*  Lay this out for me. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=194.85999999999999s)]
*  What does it mean that it's going away? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=195.85999999999999s)]
*  It means three big things, really. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, the first thing is that the health care system is now going to treat COVID like it's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=199.45999999999998s)]
*  any other disease, like it's diabetes. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=202.94s)]
*  So basically it puts COVID into the category of all other health issues. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=205.26s)]
*  And that means into the category of complicated, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=210.94s)]
*  That is the American health care system. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=215.5s)]
*  It's incredibly complicated and it will make your head hurt to figure out what you qualify [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=216.5s)]
*  for and what you don't. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=220.73999999999998s)]
*  A lot depends on what kind of insurance you have, like it does for everything else. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=223.22s)]
*  If you have private insurance, you may not even notice a difference. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=234.22s)]
*  So if you want a test, if you want a PCR test for COVID, you have to go to the doctor and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=238.14000000000001s)]
*  have them prescribe the test. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  You can still go to the store and get an antigen test, but you just won't get those aid-free [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=244.46s)]
*  tests a month like we were getting. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=248.74s)]
*  If you want a drug, the doctor has to prescribe it for you and your insurance company has [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=251.54s)]
*  to cover it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=255.3s)]
*  If you have Medicare, you may still be able to get free tests and free treatments, but [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=257.94s)]
*  only if they're ordered by a physician and you may still have out-of-pocket costs. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=262.66s)]
*  If you have Medicaid, the tests will only be free till the second half of 2024. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=267.26s)]
*  And Medicaid may even cover drugs like Paxlovid that are under emergency use authorization, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=273.74s)]
*  but that will depend on your state. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=279.1s)]
*  But if you're uninsured, you're not going to be able to get the vaccines, tests, and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  treatments for free the way that you used to. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=285.7s)]
*  You may still be able to get some of them through community clinics, and there are programs [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=287.85999999999996s)]
*  to help uninsured children get what they need. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=292.41999999999996s)]
*  But if you don't have insurance, you might very well end up paying a lot of money out [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=295.46s)]
*  of pocket for all of this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=299.65999999999997s)]
*  And what effect do you think that will have? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=306.74s)]
*  That uninsured people won't have free access to tests and treatments. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=309.46s)]
*  It means a lot fewer people will get tested, even fewer than now. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=313.74s)]
*  It means a lot more people will probably get sick because they won't get treated. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  It means the hospitals may be more full with people who are low income, who've been the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=321.62s)]
*  hardest hit by the pandemic and will continue to be. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=326.02s)]
*  And a lot more people will be in that category now because remember the federal government [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=329.9s)]
*  allowed states to get extra money in exchange for not booting people off Medicaid? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=335.14s)]
*  Well, in December, Congress decided that that should end in April. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  And so starting in April, the states are going to start kicking people off of Medicaid and [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=344.02s)]
*  all those people will lose insurance. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=348.26s)]
*  And that means a lot of people who are getting all of these things, tests and treatments [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  and vaccines through Medicaid, will now lose them. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=354.41999999999996s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=358.21999999999997s)]
*  So how many people roughly are we talking about? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=359.21999999999997s)]
*  At the moment, there are about 80 to 90 million people on these total. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=362.7s)]
*  And there's one estimate that says 15 million may lose it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=367.32s)]
*  Wow, that's a lot of people. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=370.82s)]
*  That is a lot of people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=372.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we already have about 30 million people in this country who don't have insurance. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  And when people start getting kicked off Medicaid, they will add to those numbers. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=378.94s)]
*  Okay, so the first big effect is if you don't have insurance, and the number of uninsured [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=382.78s)]
*  is about to really expand, you may be paying more for treatment. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=388.21999999999997s)]
*  What's the second big effect? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=392.62s)]
*  The second biggest effect is that pharma companies are now going to charge a lot of money for [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=394.98s)]
*  vaccines and for treatments. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=399.98s)]
*  Pfizer and Moderna have both said that they'll charge somewhere between $80 and $130 for [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  a vaccine dose. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=408.94s)]
*  The government was paying $30 per dose and we were getting it for free. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=410.3s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=413.98s)]
*  So that's a huge markup. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=415.02s)]
*  That's a huge markup. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=416.68s)]
*  But I thought that taxpayers themselves were the ones who paid for the development of this [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=417.96s)]
*  thing, right? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=422.6s)]
*  Through that Operation Warp Speed that happened under the Trump administration. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=423.6s)]
*  Like why are these publicly paid for vaccines now going to make a lot of money for pharmaceutical [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=428.04s)]
*  companies? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=434.44s)]
*  These agreements were made in the fog of war. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=435.68s)]
*  And my conversations with people who were involved say that the government did not get [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=438.32s)]
*  all that it could for its money. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=443.4s)]
*  And they built in some things that made it very difficult for them to compel companies [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=445.78s)]
*  to do anything. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=449.67999999999995s)]
*  That means the companies are now free to charge whatever they want and they are free to develop [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=451.38s)]
*  anything new that they want. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=456.58s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=458.05999999999995s)]
*  So it all again just goes back to the market. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=459.05999999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  So is this basically the government acknowledging that yes, this will mean fewer people will [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=462.91999999999996s)]
*  have access to the vaccines and that's okay because the vaccines are just not as important [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=467.67999999999995s)]
*  as they once were because most people have gotten at least a few doses already. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=473.74s)]
*  They're not saying that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  What they're actually saying is that vaccines are really important and they're making sure [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=478.90000000000003s)]
*  that every insurance, every kind of insurance will have to cover vaccines. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=482.26000000000005s)]
*  So if you have insurance, you won't really notice a difference. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  What is changing is that these manufacturers can now set the price for where they want [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=490.20000000000005s)]
*  it, sort of like they do for everything else. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=495.8s)]
*  And then your insurance company is going to have to negotiate with them to figure out [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=497.8s)]
*  how they'll cover it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=501.22s)]
*  Okay, so what's the third big effect? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  The third big effect is something called Title 42, which is a policy implemented by the Trump [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  administration way back in March 2020. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  And it allowed border patrol officers to send back migrants who were crossing the border [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=511.78000000000003s)]
*  from Mexico, sent them back to Mexico. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=517.1s)]
*  And it was a public health order because the thinking was new people coming into the country [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=519.78s)]
*  increases COVID risk. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=524.54s)]
*  It's one of the ways in which we could contain the epidemic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=526.66s)]
*  Remember, in March 2020, things were pretty bad. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=529.62s)]
*  We were trying everything. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=532.22s)]
*  But what the Biden administration is saying now is if there is no public health emergency, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=534.3000000000001s)]
*  then there's no need for Title 42 either. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=539.7s)]
*  And so Title 42 will go away. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=541.62s)]
*  So the Biden administration is effectively now saying, you know, we're not in that public [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=543.82s)]
*  health emergency anymore. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  We can no longer justify Title 42, the rule that allowed the US to keep people out because [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=548.6s)]
*  it was a global pandemic. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=554.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=556.5s)]
*  And so what that means is that more people may now come to the border and seek to come [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=557.5s)]
*  into the United States because that rule is no longer in place. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=561.56s)]
*  OK, so it sounds like with the end of the public health emergency, a few things are [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  staying the same, but a lot of things are changing in pretty significant ways. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=571.1999999999999s)]
*  But why is President Biden doing this? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=575.0s)]
*  And why now? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=577.92s)]
*  Well, why is because it's an acknowledgement that we are not in a public health emergency [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=578.92s)]
*  anymore. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  Why now? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=585.62s)]
*  The answer to that has a lot to do with politics. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=587.24s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=591.4s)]
*  So Apoorva, before the break, you said that the timing for the administration's decision [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=609.6s)]
*  to end the public health emergency is in part because of politics. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=613.84s)]
*  What are those politics? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=617.4s)]
*  This public health emergency was set to expire in April anyway, and the expectation from [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=619.38s)]
*  a lot of people was that it would either be allowed to finish then or that the Biden administration [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  might extend it for a few more months. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=629.46s)]
*  But certainly sometime this year, it would end. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=631.58s)]
*  Why this week? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=635.58s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=636.58s)]
*  Today, I rise to push for immediate and overwhelming passage of my legislation, H.R. 3-A2. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=637.58s)]
*  The pandemic is over, Act. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=643.58s)]
*  On Tuesday, the House passed a bill called pandemic is over. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=645.14s)]
*  As you know, Republicans have been saying now for many, many, many months that the pandemic [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=651.34s)]
*  is over. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=656.42s)]
*  This week, we are voting on several bills designed to do what we all in America have [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=657.42s)]
*  known for some time. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=661.5s)]
*  Americans have moved on from the pandemic. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=663.06s)]
*  Georgians in my district went back to work and back to school over two years ago. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  Emergency executive authority should be limited and only for extraordinary circumstances. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=668.98s)]
*  And this is no longer an extraordinary circumstance. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=673.82s)]
*  And this bill was meant to end the public health emergency the second it was signed [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=677.46s)]
*  into law. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  The pandemic is over, Act, sends a loud and clear message to President Biden. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=683.0600000000001s)]
*  The American people are tired of living in a perpetual state of emergency, and it's long [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=686.34s)]
*  overdue for Congress to take back the authorities granted under Article 1 of the Constitution. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=690.5400000000001s)]
*  Now that was probably never going to happen because the Senate wouldn't have passed it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=695.86s)]
*  But this was their way of saying we think the pandemic is over. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=698.96s)]
*  But what it would have meant is that everything that the public health emergency put into [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=702.78s)]
*  place would have ended immediately the second this became law. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=707.5s)]
*  The Biden administration has always said they would give at least 60 days warning for everything [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=712.04s)]
*  to unwind because they put so many complicated things into place. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=716.22s)]
*  The system needs time to undo all of those things. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=720.6s)]
*  And so this was the Biden administration's way of saying, we agree with you, the pandemic [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=723.9s)]
*  is over, but we're going to do this on our terms. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=728.1800000000001s)]
*  The decision to do this now was not based purely on some public health calculation about [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=731.22s)]
*  COVID. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=736.74s)]
*  Well, there's no real public health metric that these things can be based on. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=737.74s)]
*  But the administration has been saying for quite a long time now that we are not in the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=742.94s)]
*  same state of crisis that we were in. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=747.66s)]
*  And the numbers do show that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=750.66s)]
*  We did not have anywhere near the kind of deaths or even hospitalizations that we saw [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=752.26s)]
*  the previous two winters, and we weren't taking precautions this year. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=756.4200000000001s)]
*  So this is really an acknowledgement of something that the administration and a lot of experts [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=760.28s)]
*  have been saying for quite a while, which is this is a new phase. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=765.4399999999999s)]
*  But that said, I do want to note that we are still seeing somewhere around 500 deaths a [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=770.3s)]
*  day. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=774.9599999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=775.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are not trivial numbers that you know, they feel like a lot less because [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  they are a lot less than the previous years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=779.8399999999999s)]
*  But this is still a pretty high level of damage that COVID is able to inflict. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=782.4s)]
*  Even if most people feel like this is done, the virus is not done with us. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=788.38s)]
*  Does any of this change the way we should be thinking about how we approach COVID? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=793.74s)]
*  Like as individuals? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=799.4200000000001s)]
*  What should be my COVID hygiene practices, if you will? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=801.14s)]
*  How you feel about the pandemic and what you do really depends on your risk level and your [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=806.3000000000001s)]
*  risk tolerance. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=813.1800000000001s)]
*  If you are over 65, if you're immunocompromised, if you're pregnant, if you have a baby under [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=814.74s)]
*  one and you want to protect that baby, the virus is still very much a threat. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=819.62s)]
*  And those people should still continue to mask everywhere they can to get their vaccine [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=824.94s)]
*  doses on time and to protect themselves every way they can. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=830.1s)]
*  For everybody else, really, it's a matter of personal choice now because the government [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=834.3s)]
*  is saying we're no longer thinking this is an emergency. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=839.38s)]
*  You make the decision. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=843.1s)]
*  So it sounds like you're saying I don't need to get a booster anymore. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=844.78s)]
*  I'm a healthy person. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=848.02s)]
*  I'm done with boosters. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=849.5s)]
*  It seems that way from this winter. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=851.5400000000001s)]
*  Only about 16% of the population got the bivalent booster and yet this winter we didn't see [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=854.3000000000001s)]
*  anywhere near the kind of deaths we saw the last two winters. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=859.6800000000001s)]
*  Even this winter, the people who are in the hospitals are older adults who are most at [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=863.84s)]
*  risk from any respiratory disease. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=868.22s)]
*  Having said that, the FDA has said they would like to go to a system where everybody would [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=870.9s)]
*  get an annual shot, kind of like we do for the flu. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=876.5799999999999s)]
*  So then can we just start treating this thing like the flu? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=879.9s)]
*  Is COVID the flu, basically, at this point? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=883.66s)]
*  No, it's not the flu. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=885.86s)]
*  I mean, it's an endemic virus like the flu in the sense that we're going to live with [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=887.66s)]
*  this forever, but we don't know it anywhere near as well as we know the flu. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=891.34s)]
*  Flu is a very old friend, an old enemy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=896.06s)]
*  And COVID is still such a mystery to us. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=899.96s)]
*  It's way more contagious, it's way more deadly, and we really have no idea about its seasonality. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=903.2s)]
*  We know, for example, that okay, every winter we'll probably see a wave of some size, but [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=908.1800000000001s)]
*  we don't know when else in the year it might come. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=913.44s)]
*  We don't know how big it will be. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=915.52s)]
*  We don't know how often it will change, which new variant will come our way. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=917.84s)]
*  There's just so many unanswered things about this virus that are not the case for flu. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=922.44s)]
*  That is not the answer I was hoping for. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=928.12s)]
*  I mean, it seems to kind of behave in the same way, roughly, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=931.12s)]
*  Okay, so we don't know what season it comes in, but it's just, it's not changing our lives [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=935.48s)]
*  and turning them upside down in the way that it once was. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=940.2s)]
*  At the moment, I really hesitate to draw conclusions about what this virus is doing because it [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=943.58s)]
*  has thrown so many surprises at us. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=949.28s)]
*  It could still come up with a new variant that gets around the vaccines. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=951.88s)]
*  We may all still need to go get another booster. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=954.72s)]
*  We may need new drugs. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=956.82s)]
*  We are not fully out of the woods. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=959.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you think it will ever get predictable in the way that the flu is? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=962.1400000000001s)]
*  Or are we seriously just living with this unpredictable thing forever? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=966.9000000000001s)]
*  That's the hope that we will understand when this virus comes around. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=971.6s)]
*  It hasn't been long enough. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=976.38s)]
*  We've only been in this for three years, and the previous two years we didn't see other [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=977.94s)]
*  respiratory viruses. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=982.22s)]
*  This year we had RSV, we had flu, we had COVID, and we don't know how those viruses really [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=983.74s)]
*  play with each other yet, how they will affect each other's seasonality. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=988.1s)]
*  So we need at least another year or a couple more years to see what this virus does at [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=992.7s)]
*  different parts of the year. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=998.58s)]
*  Up over the last time we did an episode together, I asked you if COVID was a road trip from [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1000.02s)]
*  the East Coast to the West Coast, where were we in that journey? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1013.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think at the time, some point last year, you said somewhere in the Midwest. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1018.18s)]
*  Where are we on the journey? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1024.54s)]
*  How close are we to San Francisco? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1026.3s)]
*  We're closer, but San Francisco may never have been the destination. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1028.82s)]
*  If we thought that we were going to reach herd immunity and be rid of this virus, San [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1034.26s)]
*  Francisco was never in the cards. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1038.3799999999999s)]
*  The GPS was always set to Denver. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1040.1s)]
*  We just thought we were headed to San Francisco. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1042.44s)]
*  Apoorva, thank you. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1044.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1047.3799999999999s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1049.14s)]
*  Here's what else you should know today. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1078.82s)]
*  This resolution is not about engaging in a tit for tat with my colleagues on the other [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1080.54s)]
*  side of the aisle. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1084.54s)]
*  This is about keeping someone with a long record of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel bias [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1085.54s)]
*  off the Foreign Affairs Committee, which needs objective emissaries for our foreign policy. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1090.86s)]
*  On Thursday, the Republican-led House passed a resolution to oust Representative Ilhan [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1096.3s)]
*  Omar of Minnesota from the Foreign Affairs Committee over her past comments about Israel [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1101.86s)]
*  that were condemned as anti-Semitic. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1107.02s)]
*  There is an idea out there that I do not have objective decision making because of who I [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1109.5s)]
*  am, where I come from, and my perspective. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1115.74s)]
*  But I reject that. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1119.0600000000002s)]
*  We say there is nothing objective about policymaking. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1121.02s)]
*  We all inject our perspective, our point of views, our lived experiences, and the voices [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1125.66s)]
*  of our constituents. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1132.14s)]
*  That's what democracy is about. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1134.14s)]
*  The move settled a partisan score in the House that had been festering since 2021 when Democrats [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1136.38s)]
*  stripped Republicans of their committee assignments in response to social media posts that endorsed [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1142.0200000000002s)]
*  violence against Democrats. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1147.46s)]
*  And, the U.S. announced it would increase its military presence in the Philippines to [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1149.9s)]
*  what will be the largest U.S. presence there in 30 years. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1155.94s)]
*  The plan allows Washington to station military equipment and build facilities in nine locations [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1159.9s)]
*  across the country. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1165.04s)]
*  Some of the locations were bases that it had already been using. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1166.56s)]
*  The deal comes as Washington tries to reaffirm its influence in the region and to counter [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1170.16s)]
*  what it sees as aggression from China. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1175.04s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson, Shannon Lin, and Jessica Chung. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082pPxCaWD8&t=1181.04s)]
