# The Protesters and the President
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSIWVlj-9h4)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Over the past week, what had begun as a smattering of pro-Palestinian protests on America's
*  college campuses exploded into a nationwide movement.
*  Students at dozens of universities held demonstrations, set up encampments, and at times seized academic
*  buildings.
*  In response, administrators at many of those colleges decided to crack down.
*  Calling in local police to carry out mass detentions and arrests from Arizona State
*  to the University of Georgia to City College of New York.
*  As of Thursday, police had arrested 2,000 students on more than 40 campuses.
*  A situation so startling that President Biden could no longer ignore it.
*  Look, it's basically a matter of fairness.
*  It's a matter of what's right.
*  There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.
*  Today, my colleagues Jonathan Wolf and Peter Baker, on a history-making week.
*  It's Friday, May 3rd.
*  Jonathan, as this tumultuous week on college campuses comes to an end, it feels like the
*  most extraordinary scenes played out on the campus of the University of California, Los
*  Angeles, where you have been reporting.
*  What is the story of how that protest started and ultimately became so explosive?
*  So late last week, pro-Palestinian protesters set up an encampment at the University of
*  California Los Angeles.
*  It was right in front of Royce Hall, which I don't know if you are familiar with UCLA,
*  but it's like a very famous red brick building.
*  It's like on all the brochures.
*  And there was two things that stood out about this encampment.
*  And the first thing was that they sort of barricaded the encampment.
*  The encampment, complete with tents and barricades, has been set up in the middle of the Westwood
*  campus.
*  The protesters...
*  They have metal grates, they had wooden pallets, and they sort of separated themselves from
*  the campus.
*  This is kind of interesting.
*  They are controlling access, as we've been talking about.
*  They are trying to control who is allowed in, who is allowed out.
*  They sort of policed the areas.
*  They only would let people that were part of their community, they said, inside.
*  I'm a UCLA student.
*  I deserve to go here.
*  We pay tuition.
*  This is our school.
*  And they're not letting me walk in.
*  Will you let me go in?
*  We're not engaging with that.
*  Then you can move.
*  Will you move?
*  And the second thing that stood out about this camp was that it immediately attracted
*  pro-Israel counter protesters.
*  And what did the leadership of UCLA say about all of this, the encampment and these counter
*  protesters?
*  So the University of California's approach was pretty unique.
*  They had a really hands-off approach, and they allowed the pro-Palestinian protesters
*  to set up an encampment.
*  They allowed the counter protesters to happen.
*  I mean, this is a public university, so anyone who wants to can just enter the campus.
*  So when do things start to escalate?
*  So there were definitely fights and scuffles through the weekend, but a turning point was
*  really Sunday.
*  This group called the Israeli American Council, they're a nonprofit organization, organized
*  a rally on campus.
*  The Israeli American Council has really been against these pro-Palestinian protests.
*  They say that they're anti-Semitic.
*  So this nonprofit group sets up a stage with a screen, really just a few yards from the
*  pro-Palestinian encampment.
*  We are grateful that this past Friday, the University of California stated that they
*  will continue to oppose any calls for boycott and divestment from Israel.
*  And they host speakers and they held prayers.
*  Jewish students, you're not alone.
*  Oh, you're not alone.
*  We are right here with you.
*  And we are right here with you, Israel.
*  And then lots of other people start showing up, and the proximity between protesters and
*  counter protesters and even some agitators makes it really clear that something was about
*  to happen.
*  And what was that?
*  What ended up happening?
*  On Monday night, a group of about 60 counter protesters tried to breach the encampment
*  there and the campus police had to break it up.
*  And things escalated again on Tuesday.
*  They stormed the barricades and it's a complete riot.
*  I went to report on what happened just a few hours after it ended.
*  Hello?
*  Hi.
*  I spoke to a lot of protesters and I met one demonstrator, Marie.
*  Yeah, my first name is Marie, M-A-R-I-E, last name Salem.
*  And Marie described what happened.
*  So can you just tell me a little bit about what happened last night?
*  Last night, we were approached by over 100 counter protesters who were very mobilized
*  and ready to break into camp.
*  They proceeded to try to breach our barricades extremely violently.
*  Marie said it started getting out of hand when counter protesters started setting off
*  fireworks towards the camp.
*  They had bear spray, they had mace, they were throwing wood and like spears, throwing water
*  bottles, continuing fireworks.
*  So she said that they were terrified.
*  It was just all hands on deck.
*  Everyone was guarding the barricades.
*  Every time someone was experienced the bear spray or mace or was hit and bleeding, we
*  had some medics in the front line and then we had people.
*  And they said that they were just trying to take care of people who were injured.
*  I mean, at any given moment, there is, you know, five to 10 people being treated.
*  So what you described to me sounded more like a battlefield than a college campus.
*  And it was just a complete terror and complete abandonment of the university.
*  We also watched private security watch this the entire time on the stairs.
*  And some LAPD were stationed about a football field length back from these counter protesters
*  and did not make a single arrest, did not attempt to stop any violence, did not attempt
*  to get in between the two groups.
*  No attempt.
*  I should say I spoke to state authorities and eyewitnesses and they confirmed Marie's
*  account about what happened that night, both in terms of the violence that took place at
*  the encampment and how law enforcement responded.
*  So in the end, people ended up fighting for hours before the police intervened.
*  So in her mind, UCLA's hands off approach, which seemed to have prevailed throughout
*  this entire period, ends up being way too hands off in a moment when students were
*  in jeopardy.
*  That's right.
*  And so at this point, the protesters in the encampment started preparing for sort of two
*  possibilities.
*  One was that this group of counter protesters would return and attack them.
*  And the second one was that the police would come and try to break up this encampment.
*  So they start building up the barricades, they start reinforcing them with wood.
*  And during the day, hundreds of people came and brought them supplies.
*  They brought food.
*  They brought helmets, goggles, earplugs, saline solution, all sorts of things these people
*  could use to defend themselves.
*  And so they're really getting ready to burrow in.
*  And in the end, it was the police who came.
*  So Wednesday at 7 p.m., they made an announcement on top of voice hall, which overlooks the
*  encampment.
*  Administrative criminal actions up to and including arrest.
*  Please leave the area immediately.
*  And they told people in the encampment that they needed to leave or face arrest.
*  And so as night falls, they put on all this gear that they've been collecting, the goggles,
*  the masks and the earplugs, and they wait for the police.
*  And so the police arrive and sort of stationed themselves right in front of the encampment.
*  And then at a certain point, they stormed the back stairs of the encampment.
*  And this is the stairs that the protesters are having using to enter and exit the camp.
*  They set up a line and the protesters do this really surprising thing.
*  They open up umbrellas, they have these sort of strobe lights and they're flashing them
*  at the police who sort of just like slowly back out of the camp.
*  And so at this point, they're feeling really great.
*  You know, they're like, we did it.
*  We pushed them out of the camp.
*  And when the cops try to push again on those same set of stairs, the protesters organize
*  themselves with all these shields that they had built earlier and they go and confront
*  them.
*  And so there's this moment where the police are trying to push up the stairs and the protesters
*  are literally pushing them back.
*  And at a certain point, dozens of police officers who were there basically just turn around
*  and leave.
*  So how does this eventually come to an end?
*  So at a certain point, the police push in again.
*  Most of the conflict is centered at the front of these barricades and the police just start
*  tearing them apart.
*  They remove the front barricade and in its place is this group of protesters who have
*  linked arms and they're hanging on to each other.
*  And the police are trying to pull protesters one by one away from this group.
*  But they're having a really hard time because there's so many protesters and they're all
*  just hanging on to each other.
*  So at a certain point, one of the police officers started firing something into the crowd.
*  We don't exactly know what it was, but it really spooked the protesters.
*  They started falling back.
*  Everyone was really scared.
*  The protesters were yelling, don't shoot us.
*  And at that point, the police just sort of stormed the camp.
*  And so after about four hours of this, the police pushed the protesters out of the encampment.
*  They had arrested about 200 protesters and this is finally over.
*  I'm just curious, Jonathan, because you're standing right there.
*  You are bearing witness to this all.
*  What your thinking, what your impressions of this were?
*  I mean, I was stunned.
*  These are mostly teenagers.
*  This is a college campus, an institution of higher learning.
*  And what I saw in front of me looked like a war zone.
*  The massive barricades of police coming in with riot gear and all this violence was happening
*  in front of these red brick buildings that are famous for symbolizing really open college
*  campus and everything about it was just totally surreal.
*  Well, Jonathan, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Peter, around 10 a.m. on Thursday morning, as the smoke is literally still clearing at
*  the University of California, Los Angeles, you get word that President Biden is going
*  to speak.
*  Right, exactly.
*  Wasn't on his public schedule.
*  He was about to head to Andrews Air Force Base in order to take a trip.
*  And then suddenly we got the notice that he was going to be addressing the cameras in
*  the Roosevelt Room.
*  They didn't tell us what he was going to talk about, but it was pretty clear, I think everybody
*  understood that it was going to be about these campus protests, about the growing violence
*  and the clashes with police and the arrests that the entire country had been watching
*  on TV every night for the past week.
*  And I think that we watching just that morning with UCLA and it reached the point where he
*  just had to say something.
*  And why in his estimation, and those of his advisors, was this the moment that Biden had
*  to say something?
*  Well, it kind of reached a boiling point.
*  It kind of reached the impression of a national crisis.
*  And you expect to hear your president address it in this kind of a moment, particularly
*  because it's about his own policy.
*  His policy toward Israel is at the heart of these protests.
*  And he was getting a lot of grief.
*  He was getting a lot of grief from Republicans who were chiding him for not speaking out
*  personally.
*  He hadn't said anything about 10 days.
*  He's got a lot of pressure from Democrats, too, who wanted him to come out and be more
*  forceful.
*  It wasn't enough in their view to leave it to his spokespeople to say something.
*  Democrats felt he needed to come out and take some leadership on this.
*  And so at the appointed moment, Peter, what does Biden actually say in the Roosevelt Room
*  of the White House?
*  Good morning.
*  Good morning.
*  Before I head to North Carolina, I wanted to speak for a few moments about what's going
*  on on our college campuses here.
*  Well, he comes in the Roosevelt Room and he talks to the camera.
*  He talks about the two clashing imperatives of American principle.
*  The first is the right to free speech and for people to peacefully assemble and make
*  their voices heard.
*  The second is the rule of law.
*  Both must be upheld.
*  One is freedom of speech.
*  The other is the rule of law.
*  In fact, peaceful protest is in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential
*  issues.
*  But, but neither are we a lawless country.
*  In other words, what he's saying is, yes, I support the right of these protesters to
*  come out and object to even my own policy, in effect, is what he's saying.
*  But it shouldn't trail into violence.
*  Destroying property is not a peaceful protest.
*  It's against the law.
*  Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses.
*  It shouldn't trail into taking over buildings and obstructing students from going to class
*  or canceling their graduations.
*  Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest.
*  It's against the law.
*  And he leans very heavily into this idea that what he's seeing these days goes beyond the
*  line.
*  I understand people have strong feelings and deep convictions.
*  In America, we respect the right and protect the right for them to express that.
*  But it doesn't mean anything goes.
*  It is crossed into harassment and expressions of hate in a way that goes against the national
*  character.
*  As president, I will always defend free speech and I will always be just as strong as standing
*  up for the rule of law.
*  That's my responsibility to you, the American people, my obligation to the Constitution.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Right.
*  As I watched the speech, I heard his overriding message to basically be, I, the president,
*  I say some drawing a line.
*  These protests and counter protests, the seizing and defacing of campus buildings, class disruption,
*  all of it, name calling, it's getting out of hand that there's a right way to do this.
*  And what I'm seeing is the wrong way to do it.
*  And it has to stop.
*  That's exactly right.
*  And as he's wrapping up, reporters, of course, ask questions.
*  And the first question is, Mr. President, have the protests forced you to reconsider
*  any of the policies with regard to the region?
*  Will this change your policy toward the war in Gaza, which of course is exactly what the
*  protesters want?
*  That's the point.
*  Right.
*  And he basically says, no, no, just one word.
*  No.
*  Right.
*  And that felt kind of important as brief and fleeting as it was, because at the end of
*  the day, what he's saying to these protesters is, I'm not going to do what you want.
*  And basically, your protests are never going to work.
*  I'm not going to change the US's involvement in this war.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  He is saying, you know, I'm not going to be swayed by angry people in the streets.
*  I'm going to do what I think is right when it comes to foreign policy.
*  Now what he thinks is that they're not giving him enough credit for trying to achieve what
*  they want, which is an end of the war.
*  He has been pressuring Israel and Hamas to come to a deal for a ceasefire that hopefully
*  in his view would then lead to a more enduring end of hostilities.
*  But of course, this deal hasn't gone anywhere.
*  Hamas in particular seems to be resisting it.
*  And so the president is left with a policy of arming Israel without having found a way
*  yet to stop the war.
*  Right.
*  I wonder though, Peter, if we're being honest, don't these protests, despite what Biden is
*  saying there, inevitably exert a kind of power over him?
*  You know, becoming one of many pressures, but a pressure nonetheless that does influence
*  how he thinks about these moments.
*  I mean, here he is at the White House devoting an entire conversation to the nation to these
*  campus protests.
*  Well he looks, he knows this feeds into the political environment in which he's running
*  for reelection, in which he basically has people who otherwise might be his supporters
*  on the left disenchanted with him.
*  And he knows that there's a cost to be paid.
*  And that certainly obviously is in his head as he's thinking about what to do.
*  But I think his view of the war is changing by the day for all sorts of reasons and most
*  of them having to do with realities on the ground.
*  He has decided that Israel has gone far enough, if not too far in the way it has conducted
*  this operation in Gaza.
*  He is upset about the humanitarian crisis there.
*  And he's looking for a way to wrap all this up into kind of a move that would move to
*  peacemaking, like beginning to get the region to a different stage, maybe have a deal with
*  the Saudis to normalize relations with Israel in exchange for some sort of a two state solution
*  that would eventually resolve the Palestinian issue at its core.
*  So I think it's probably fair to say that the protest won't move him in an immediate
*  kind of sense, but they obviously play into the larger zeitgeist of the moment.
*  I also think it's important to know who Joe Biden is at heart.
*  Explain that.
*  He's not drawn to activism.
*  He was around in 1968, the last time we saw this major conflagration at Columbia University,
*  for instance.
*  At the time, Joe Biden was a law student in Syracuse, about 250 miles away.
*  And he was an institutionalist even then.
*  He was just focused on his studies.
*  He was about to graduate.
*  He was thinking about the law career.
*  And he didn't really have much of an affinity, I think, for his fellow students of that era,
*  for their activist way of looking at things.
*  He tells a story in his memoir about walking down the street in Syracuse one day to go
*  to the pizza shop with some friends.
*  And they walk by the administration building and they see people hanging out of the windows.
*  They're hanging SDS banner.
*  That's the students for a democratic society, which was one of the big activist groups of
*  the era.
*  And he says, they were taking over the building and we looked up and said, look at those
*  assholes.
*  That's how far apart from the anti-war movement I was.
*  That's him writing in his memoir.
*  So to a young Joe Biden, those who devote their time and their energy to protesting
*  the war are, I don't need to repeat the word twice, but they're losers.
*  They're not worth his time.
*  Well, I think it's the tactics they're using more than the goals that he disagreed with.
*  He would tell you he disagreed with the Vietnam War.
*  He was for civil rights, but he thought that taking over a building was performative, was
*  all about getting attention and that there was a better way in his view to do it.
*  He was somebody who wants to work inside the system.
*  He said in an interview quite a few years back, he says, look, I was wearing sports
*  coats in that era.
*  He saw himself becoming part of the system, not somebody trying to tear it down.
*  And so how should we think about that Joe Biden when we think about this Joe Biden?
*  The Joe Biden who, as a young man, looked upon anti-war protesters with disdain and
*  the one who is now president and his very own policies have inspired such ferocious
*  campus protests.
*  Yeah, that Joe Biden, the 1968 Joe Biden, he could just throw on a sports coat, go to
*  the pizza shop with his friends, make fun of the activists and call them names, and then that's it.
*  They didn't have to affect his life.
*  But that's not what 2024 Joe Biden can do.
*  Now, wherever he goes, he's dog by this.
*  He goes to speeches and people are shouting at him, genocide, Joe, genocide, Joe.
*  He is the target of the same kind of a movement that he disdained in 1968.
*  And so as much as he would like to ignore it or move on or focus on other things,
*  I think this has become a defining image of his year.
*  And one of the defining images, perhaps, of his presidency and 2024 Joe Biden can't simply
*  ignore it.
*  Well, Peter, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  During testimony on Thursday in Donald Trump's hush money trial, jurors heard a recording
*  secretly made by Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen in which Trump discusses a deal to buy
*  a woman's silence.
*  In the recording, Trump asks Cohen about how one payment made by Trump to a woman named
*  Karen McDougal would be financed.
*  The recording could complicate efforts by Trump's lawyers to distance him from the
*  hush money deals at the center of the trial.
*  A final thing to know tomorrow morning, we'll be sending you the latest episode from our
*  colleagues over at the interview.
*  This week, David Marquesi talks with comedy star Marlon Wayans about his new stand up
*  special.
*  It's a high that you get when you don't know if this joke that I'm about to say is
*  going to offend everybody or they're going to walk out or they're going to boo me or
*  they're going to hate this.
*  And then you tell it and everybody cracks up.
