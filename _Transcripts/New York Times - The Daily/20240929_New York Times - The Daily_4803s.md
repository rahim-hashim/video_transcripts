# The Deserter Parts 4 and 5
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAZN9pTYUXc)
*  Part Four The Long Escape
*  The Russian evacuation vehicle crashed through the wreckage of the forest, passing the upturned,
*  splintered poplar trees and cratered roads. The man riding on top, wherever they could find space
*  to cling, could barely hang on, moaning. Ivan knew he needed a plan, urgently. Otherwise,
*  they would send him back into battle right away. Whether it had been riding itself through his
*  mind all along, or whether he thought of it on the spot, he would never know. But the answer
*  was self-evident. He needed to insist on surgery for his back. Years earlier, Ivan was holding
*  Sasha in his arms when he fell down hard. Pain shot up his leg and back. It was a herniated disc.
*  Ivan began trying to remember how Roman limped when he came back from the S.V.O. so he could
*  replicate it. He decided that his gait should be more laborious. He needed to really wince
*  when he put weight on his foot. When the vehicle pulled up to a field hospital,
*  it was a broken building with no window panes, just polyethylene flapping over the frames.
*  There were medics writing down what kind of injury each man had. Ivan observed that most
*  of the assembled could rip open their uniforms and show some kind of blood.
*  He needed to think. He let everyone pass him.
*  What have you got? the medic asked him. My back. What, you got hit in the back? Wounded? No,
*  my back's jammed. Hernia. The guy eyed him. All right, I'll put you on the other list.
*  At the entrance, the men unclipped their belts, unlaced their boots, and handed in their armor.
*  The injured were wandering around in their socks on tiles streaked with blood and grime.
*  The nurses couldn't keep up with the mopping. Ivan saw one of his subordinates,
*  Space, talking on a cell phone. He thought he had bagged everyone's phone and left them
*  with Lyon before the operation. Why do you have your phone? Ivan demanded.
*  Well, shit, Commander Space said. I had more than one.
*  First of all, you're an asshole. You didn't follow orders, Ivan told him.
*  And secondly, give me the phone now. I need to call my wife.
*  Ivan dialed Anna. Everything is fine, he told her. I'm alive. We're back from there.
*  Anna was sobbing so hard she couldn't speak. When Ivan got off the call, he went inside.
*  It seemed as if the doctors there were churning everyone they could through an X-ray machine.
*  They told Ivan they would X-ray his back, too.
*  My problem doesn't show up on X-rays, Ivan insisted. I need an MRI. No one listened.
*  The doctors at the field hospitals were overworked, underprepared, or underqualified. Either way,
*  they had a reputation for making mistakes. Bare-blood, Ivan's deputy who lost part of
*  a finger in the battle, wasn't even X-rayed properly, so they didn't spot shrapnel in his
*  wound, which would get infected and fester. Months later, he would need to have two additional
*  phalanges removed. As the men waited, someone brought them breakfast. The plate was plain,
*  watery potatoes with meat and onions. But Ivan had never tasted anything so good. It was almost
*  sweet, melting in his mouth. There was tea in regular cardboard cups. The firmness of the
*  cardboard felt like a luxury. A galette, which was probably not even a galette that they dunked
*  in the tea seemed so sweet, too. An hour ago, he was under fire, and now he was sitting barefoot
*  on a bench, eating delicious food. He couldn't stop marveling at the contrast. He was sure in
*  that moment that he would remember this meal for the rest of his life. Ivan limped all the way to
*  the sleeping quarters. He washed his clothes. There was a shower. The two minutes under the water
*  felt like a dream. He hadn't showered in more than a month. He lay down on a clean cot. It felt so
*  soft that these realities existed simultaneously was bewildering. A place where there is always
*  something to eat, which people tried to clean with running water, and yet at the same time,
*  in the distance, you can still hear the explosions, he thought, and promptly fell asleep.
*  The next morning, Ivan was told he would be pushed onward to a hospital in Donetsk for further
*  examination. The men loaded up into a truck. Donetsk was where the military sorted the injured,
*  the fulcrum of the reverse march from Russia's strategy of throwing its men relentlessly at
*  the front. Some were operated on there. Others were flown to Moscow or driven to Rostov-on-Don.
*  As they waited for intake and triage, Ivan relished the line. The same worthless paperwork
*  and thumb twiddling that had always irritated him became an asset. He had a lot to think about.
*  He needed to get back to Russian soil. He wasn't sure what he would do once he got there,
*  but he knew it would give him the time to figure it out. Donetsk was not safe enough. If you were
*  unlucky, it was still possible to be redeployed to the front line in a few hours. The doctor,
*  who initially examined Ivan, referred him to a neurologist. When Ivan said he needed a neurosurgeon,
*  he was told there were none. The neurologist began to probe his leg, raising and lowering it,
*  telling Ivan to tell him when the pain started. Ivan yelped, there, there, he feigned. You'll
*  be fine, the doctor told him. It will pass. Ivan tried to show the doctor his old MRI scan
*  on his phone, but the doctor refused to look at anything not printed on paper.
*  Ivan was to fill the prescription and return to his unit. This cannot be the end of this story.
*  He raced to print out his old MRI scan. He went back to the original doctor. The neurologist
*  wouldn't even look at the results of my MRI, Ivan said. I know I need surgery,
*  but he tells me to take a pill. I need a neurosurgeon. Can you send me to Moscow,
*  to St. Petersburg? The doctor looked at Ivan's printout and agreed to refer him to a different
*  neurologist. Ivan could not afford another setback. As he waited for transport, he called his mother.
*  She had an acquaintance who was a military neurosurgeon and specifically dealt with backs.
*  Give me her phone number, he said. I need to talk to her right away.
*  Ivan's mother didn't ask questions, but he wouldn't have told her anything anyway.
*  Ivan couldn't have her thinking he was a traitor. It would break her heart or worse.
*  Ivan's mother was a patriot. She cared more about appearances than about Ivan's realities. This did
*  not hurt Ivan's feelings, because he did not expect it to be another way.
*  When Ivan reached his mother's friend, he explained that the situation in Donetsk was bad.
*  My back really hurts, he told her. I'm worried that since I don't have as much pain now,
*  they will send me back. But as soon as I put on my body armor, immediately everything will get worse.
*  When you're lying down, if you can lift your leg above 30 degrees,
*  you're probably not as acute of a case, she explained to him.
*  Ivan thanked her and got off the phone. He had definitely raised his leg further than
*  30 degrees at the neurologist. He should have started yelping much earlier.
*  He cursed himself for not preparing. Each mistake could cost him his life.
*  Ivan knew he had to be personable. He chatted up the next neurologist,
*  asked him about the situation in Donetsk. War had been destroying the city since 2014,
*  but Ivan noticed that people were eerily unfazed. Parents still walked the streets
*  with their children who played outside in playgrounds. Water was intermittent.
*  The hospital stockpiled it in buckets. I have no pencils, no paper, the doctor complained.
*  We buy everything at our own expense. Ivan nodded and groaned along at all the right places.
*  The doctor examined him and said he could send him on to a civilian hospital to see a neurosurgeon
*  there and do another MRI, but he would have to pay for it out of pocket.
*  No question about it, Ivan said. I'll pay whatever I need to pay. I'll go everywhere I need to go.
*  He left the appointment and immediately went to the store. He bought some stationery and
*  some cognac and returned. Please, so everything is normal, Ivan said as he handed the items to
*  the doctor. I just wish you'd keep me here a little longer. The doctor understood.
*  Ivan got on the MRI waiting list. It would be at least ten days. He needed to pinpoint
*  exactly what symptoms he needed to qualify for surgery. Only surgery would guarantee him a ticket
*  to Russia. Ivan called Roman and asked how he was faring. He said he was much better after
*  rehabilitation. The pain had been so intense that Roman didn't just limp, he dragged his leg. Ivan
*  realized he needed to correct his gait. Rather than wincing with each step, he would start pulling
*  his leg behind him. Ivan decided to start saying that before the war, a doctor at home had told
*  him that he needed surgery to make everyone believe that a higher authority than Ivan had
*  cleared it. As an officer, he figured he could insist on doing the procedure in a military
*  hospital in Moscow or St. Petersburg, where the surgeons were competent enough that the
*  operation most likely wouldn't harm him, even if he didn't actually need it. And going through
*  with it would grant him six months of leave for rehabilitation. Maybe the war would be over by
*  then. When the civilian neurosurgeon finally saw him, Ivan went through his whole routine.
*  Yeah, this is a problem, the civilian doctor told Ivan. You can either do the surgery at this
*  hospital for a fee or in Russia with your military insurance. No, no, no, Ivan said. I would like to
*  be in the military structure. He watched as the doctor wrote his recommendations, the words that
*  would get Ivan back to safety, surgical intervention. He had no idea if the doctor had bought the ruse
*  or if he was just playing along. Either way, the man was saving his life. In the first Russian
*  city Ivan reached, Rostov-on-Don, he marveled at the silence. There was no shelling or sounds
*  of war anywhere. Ivan had continued to think about his act as he traveled. He decided to add a cane
*  to his performance. He thought it would distinguish him from the crowd when he returned to the base,
*  signifying that his injury was serious rather than some kind of sprain. Not far from the train
*  station he found a shop selling canes. It was November, it would be winter soon. Ivan was
*  playing the long game. He decided to buy the nicest cane. It was solid black with a retractable
*  spike for the ice. He wandered the back streets practicing how to use it with his left hand while
*  dragging his leg behind him. He went to the post office and put his cane on the table to fill out
*  some paperwork, but when Ivan turned around it was gone. He was in uniform so the person who
*  stole it had to know it was a wounded war veteran's cane. Welcome home. Ivan had joined the tens of
*  thousands of men making their way through the Russian military's medical system, loaded onto
*  evacuation trains, transferred and retransferred into hospitals for treatment and rehabilitation,
*  eventually ending up back at their bases. As he moved through Russia Ivan perfected his limp
*  and his grimaces. Watching the other injured men around him he realized that surgery might not be
*  the solution he originally believed it to be. That eventually he would be rehabilitated and sent
*  back to the front line almost as soon as the bandages came off. When he finally got back to
*  his base he went straight to the colonel's office without showering or shaving. He wanted to look as
*  rough as he could. I have to have back surgery he explained, showing everyone his paperwork. I got
*  an injection to block the pain. It's enough for a while but I have to have surgery. Ah, you have
*  the same story as Roman they replied at the office at HR at the medical clinic offering him a chair.
*  It was easier to sell his act because they had already heard it. Why would they think to doubt
*  its veracity? Instead they sped up his paperwork. An injured captain was a war hero. He was on the
*  next flight to Anna and Sasha. Anna met him at the airport. She could scarcely believe that he was
*  real, that he was whole, that he was with her again. They took the weekend to celebrate but
*  they couldn't allow themselves any further opportunity to relax. They knew they were on
*  borrowed time. I'm never going back there again Ivan told Anna. Never under no circumstances will
*  I go back to war. I'd rather die. Russians have two passports, international and domestic. When
*  Anna wrote to Adite Lesum on Telegram she explained that Ivan's foreign passport was locked in a safe
*  at the human resources office at the base. The person typing on the other end explained that
*  because Ivan did not have his international passport his only opportunity to leave Russia
*  would be to use his domestic passport to go to another country in the Collective Security Treaty
*  Organization, Russia's answer to NATO, which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
*  and Tajikistan. Once Ivan arrived in a CSTO country he would have to remain there. He would
*  not be in Russia but he would not be safe either. Ivan and Anna had followed the case of Mikhail
*  Zhilin, a federal guard service officer who sent his wife and child to Kazakhstan and later crossed
*  the border illegally because FGS officers are forbidden to leave Russia. Moscow put Zhilin on
*  an international wanted list and the Kazakh authorities arrested him despite his request
*  for asylum. In December 2022 they deported him to Russia despite the public pleas of his wife
*  and efforts from NGOs. Zhilin was subsequently sentenced to six and a half years in prison for
*  desertion and illegal border crossing. Anna decided that the CSTO was not an option. They needed to
*  get as far away from Russia as they could to a country that would not extradite Ivan once he was
*  declared AWOL or a deserter. He agreed in principle but had no idea how to do it. How can I run without
*  a passport Ivan asked her. Anna was undeterred. Ivan spent his vacation focused on the practicalities.
*  He needed to find the hospital in Moscow with the longest waiting list. They worked together and
*  separately. Anna went back and forth across telegram channels, websites and message boards. She decided
*  on the country they should go to. She told Ivan that she would start studying cosmetology. She needed
*  a profession that wouldn't require her to speak the local language. She would leave first with Sasha.
*  That part would be easier. Civilians, even the wives of officers, were free to travel. Ivan would
*  find a way to join them. Maybe he would have to run through the forest or maybe if he thought
*  hard enough he could find a legal way to quit. He just needed more time. Anna registered for courses
*  and an apprenticeship at a salon. She started organizing paperwork, a passport for Sasha.
*  She felt she was at the edge of a chasm, stepping into the unknown with no idea if they would make
*  it or not. They spent the New Year's holiday together. They planned and planned. It would be
*  the last time they saw each other until they met again in their final destination. Anna sat Ivan
*  down. She had been thinking about it. If you don't make it to us, it's okay. Just stay alive, she told
*  him. I'll know you're alive somewhere and that's the most important. I'll do anything to get to you,
*  he told her. I'll arrange for some guy to load me into a cargo container ship. I'll get to you somehow.
*  When Ivan returned to the base, he went back to work as he waited to get on the surgery list.
*  He reported to all the formations, the meetings, the paper pushing.
*  But now with the respect of a captain injured in war, he kept the curtains closed in their apartment
*  so he could move around without the cane. Otherwise, it would be easy to spot him from
*  the main street downstairs, from that bench at the skate park where he used to watch Anna in their
*  kitchen. It could jeopardize the whole thing. Every night he came home and ate his dinner while
*  streaming some TV show on his computer. Then he put everything aside and sat at the kitchen table
*  in silence. Maybe he could get himself declared insane and be discharged. He had heard about a
*  guy at his base who told the base psychologist that he had fallen asleep on duty, dreamed of
*  killing himself, and woke up with a gun in his mouth that he didn't remember putting there.
*  Rumor was that the guy would be dismissed for being mentally unfit for service.
*  Perhaps Ivan could get a fake mental health exemption certificate.
*  Sometimes when he had an idea like trying to be declared mentally unfit,
*  he messaged his Idite Lessam coordinator. Within the group, Ivan's case had been passed to Anton
*  Gorbachevich, who specialized in complicated situations. Though the team was public,
*  Ivan knew little about the man he was corresponding with directly, but he liked Anton's manner.
*  He was calm, collected, and responsive. He inspired trust, even though Ivan did not know his last name.
*  For over a decade, Anton had been in opposition politics in St. Petersburg.
*  He was soft-spoken and good with people. Anton himself had fled Russia within days after the
*  mobilization was announced. He had taken a circuitous route to the land crossing with Georgia
*  and had been hunted, threatened, and extorted by the police at checkpoint after checkpoint,
*  so he understood the urgency and anxiety of Ivan's situation better than many.
*  When Anton told Ivan that mental unfitness didn't disqualify anyone from serving anymore because of
*  the mobilization, Ivan returned to thinking. One night it occurred to him. All he needed was
*  his passport. So what if he got a fake and somehow swapped it with his real one?
*  Hello. I got an idea for a passport, he wrote to Anton. I can come to HR physically in the office
*  and take it. The issue was only duplication. I've heard there are people on the dark net who can help.
*  Yes, that's a good idea, Anton replied. He pointed Ivan toward Rutor, a Russian site on the dark web.
*  People could make all kinds of passports. Ten-year biometric passports with fingerprints,
*  newer five-year passports with chips. A customer could send a photo of himself,
*  and the seller would find a person who looked similar from the database of real, valid passports
*  and change the surname, the first name, the patronymic, at a cost of up to ten thousand dollars.
*  Ivan's passport was issued seven years earlier. To create a good replica, he needed to redo the
*  photograph. In his original picture, he had bangs, so he sat down with Photoshop and added bangs,
*  hair by hair. He played with his haircut, making it boxier. He smoothed out his complexion. He
*  moved his ears little by little. He took off some pounds and gave himself a more pronounced jawline.
*  He pulled sideburns from stock images, added them and smoothed them out.
*  It took him a few hours until he was happy with the result. Ivan sent the photo to the seller,
*  who showed Ivan what the final page would look like. Ivan would pay sixty thousand rubles,
*  six hundred and fifty dollars, and then wait about a month. He had submitted the paperwork
*  for surgery, but nothing had moved. Ivan began preparing anyway so he could leave as quickly as
*  possible when the fake passport arrived. He needed to sell their things. He started new telegram
*  accounts to list items so they couldn't be traced to him. Within a few weeks, he was living in an
*  empty apartment. He slept on an old mattress on the floor. When the passport arrived, Ivan noticed
*  that it was missing the watermark and the hologram. The seller had claimed that it would be an identical
*  replica. Ivan kicked himself for not discussing every single detail, but decided he wouldn't
*  complain. Probably no one would examine the passport that thoroughly. His real problem
*  was how to swap it without getting caught. Ivan knew the Human Resources Office from
*  years of worthless paperwork and reports. The HR manager sat at a desk on the right side of the room.
*  Next to him was a six-foot-high metal safe with three drawers. They were unlocked with a key. The
*  passports were kept in folders inside the drawers. Each passport had a paper bookmark in it with
*  various biographical details. Ivan thought about returning after hours, waiting for the duty officer
*  to go to the bathroom and picking the lock, but that seemed too risky. He would have to find a way
*  to take the passport under the pretense of borrowing it, but he didn't think they would let him just walk
*  off with the document. Even asking would raise too much suspicion. What could I need it for that I
*  couldn't do with it inside the room, he asked himself. Maybe, he reasoned, he would say he
*  needed to write something down for his wife's job application and make the switch while the duty
*  officer and anyone else were present. To complicate matters, Ivan could use only one arm.
*  The other would be holding the cane as part of his act, so he had to walk in with his cane in his left
*  hand, take the passport with his free right hand, and somehow swap it for the fake. He would also
*  need to remove the bookmark from the original and place it into the duplicate before returning it.
*  How could he do all that with just one hand? The HR manager's desk faced the room. Ivan would have
*  to find a way to reach into his pocket while holding both the cane and the passport. No,
*  that wouldn't work. He would need to find a way to sit down, put down his cane so he could have two
*  free hands and then reach into his pocket. But that motion could be seen from the side or the back.
*  He decided he had to avoid unnecessary movements. He would have to sit down, put his cane down,
*  and start taking down the passport details while making the swap. Ivan thought maybe he could stick
*  his passport up his sleeve. At home, he put on his uniform and practiced. The passport was bulky,
*  bigger than his wrist. Someone could notice. Ivan sat down at the kitchen table to think.
*  He attended meetings with a moleskin-type notebook. Maybe he could take the notebook
*  as if he were coming from some mindless meeting. He carried it in his right hand.
*  What if I take it, open it, and slip the passport inside? When he tried it, he realized that the
*  notebook bulged a bit. You could see something smaller sandwiched inside the larger book easily.
*  Just imagine if it slipped out and there were two identical passports on the ground.
*  He sat down again to think. What if I cut a hole in the notebook and put it in there?
*  Ivan took out a knife and carved a hole in the center of the notebook's pages.
*  He left blank pages at the back so if anyone asked him to write something down,
*  it would still be usable. He practiced how he would do it. He would walk into the office.
*  To his right, the HR manager would be seated facing the room.
*  Privet, can I have my passport, please? I need to write something down for my wife.
*  I'll copy it down right here, Ivan rehearsed. The guy would turn, open the safe, and hand
*  Ivan the passport. Ivan would take the passport with his right hand, the same one holding the
*  notebook, and walk over to a table he knew was on the other side of the room. If it was empty,
*  he would sit down. If it was occupied, he would say, buddy, can I sit down? I'll write it down
*  quickly. He was the one with a cane, after all. Of course you can, comrade captain, he imagined
*  the reply. He was an officer, injured in war. Ivan would sit down and lean his cane against the table.
*  Keeping his original passport in his right hand, he would open the notebook with his left,
*  his fingers flipping the cover to reveal the duplicate passport in the hole. Ivan would pull
*  out the duplicate with his left hand and insert the original passport with his right. Once it was in,
*  he would pull the bookmark out of the passport and close the notebook. He would reopen the
*  notebook from the back to an empty page and start to copy the details from the duplicate.
*  As he wrote, he would casually lean back in his chair and ask the guy how the morning
*  formation went that day, so he would see that Ivan was relaxed. When he was done, Ivan would
*  close the notebook from the back and pick it up tightly by the binding in one hand with the
*  duplicate passport on top. He would return it to the duty officer the same way he had taken it
*  and walk out leaning on his cane. He spent a night and a day at home practicing the movements.
*  He timed it until he could do it fast, almost with his eyes closed. He wanted to be quick,
*  muscle memory, so if he were nervous he wouldn't stumble or shake. The trick wasn't just in the
*  double-handed swap, but in moving the pages and cover backward and forward with his fingers
*  simultaneously like a difficult piano piece. Once he mastered the movements, Ivan spent a
*  week casing the HR office, determining when it was the least busy. He learned that the usual
*  senior human resources officer had left for the SVO and that in his place was a green young lieutenant
*  whom Ivan outranked. Perfect. Ivan waited for the evening when he had noticed that there typically
*  were fewer people in the office. When he walked in, the young officer was alone. Once Ivan explained
*  what he needed, the officer handed him the passport. Ivan took the original and sat down.
*  His hands were steady, left fingers flicking open the notebook, pulling out the duplicate,
*  while his right hand dropped in the original and pulled the bookmark out seamlessly.
*  He slid the bookmark into the duplicate. It couldn't have been more than a few seconds,
*  but it felt endless. The passports were swapped. Ivan opened a fresh page and began to write numbers.
*  How did the formation go? He asked, leaning back in the chair, turning to the officer.
*  Well damn, there was some bullshit there, the kid replied. Yeah, like always, Ivan answered, relaxed,
*  slowly writing. He stood up, took his cane, walked back to the desk and handed over the passport.
*  The guy didn't even look at it, just put it back in the folder.
*  Ivan walked out of the room and back to his car, holding the notebook tightly in his hand.
*  He got in and settled behind the wheel before allowing himself to peep inside. He saw the
*  hologram. It was his original passport. His insides melted. He had really done it. He called Anna.
*  The bird is in the cage, he whispered. The bird is in the cage.
*  Part Five. Stalked by Shadows.
*  Though Ivan had his passport, he was still stuck. He needed a way to get off the base
*  without arousing suspicion, but he had taken all his vacation time already.
*  He didn't think he could wait much longer. It was summer, and since the start of the invasion,
*  Russia had taken heavy casualties on multiple fronts. A hundred and twenty thousand had been
*  killed and as many as a hundred and eighty thousand injured, according to U.S. officials.
*  Roughly fifteen thousand Soviet troops were killed in the decade-long war in Afghanistan.
*  After the Wagner coup in June, when Evgeny Progozhin marched his private army on the Kremlin
*  and openly challenged the competency of Putin's military direction,
*  there was a fear of the private contractors disbanding. The enlistment campaign had driven
*  total spending on sign-up bonuses and salaries to a colossal level. It did not seem sustainable
*  for the state. Rumors about another round of mobilization were constant. Ivan feared that
*  there could be an order barring all men, or service members in particular, from leaving the country.
*  He needed to move fast. When Ivan convinced the doctor to recommend surgery, it was in the hope
*  that recovery would give him six months away from the front. But now he realized that it could be
*  his ticket out of the country entirely. He had heard that Roman, whose legs failed at the S.V.O.,
*  had received permission to leave the base to have his surgery done privately.
*  Ivan thought about it. Why can't I do the same? He went straight to the newest base commander.
*  Comrade Major, he said, I've been walking with the Kaine for six months now. So far,
*  no one has sent the documents. They say there are no places. Let me go and get the surgery on
*  my own dime. There's a good clinic and— They do surgeries there like the one I need.
*  Okay, the commander replied. Can I have ten days' vacation? Yes, permitted.
*  In five minutes Ivan wrote the report and took it back. The commander, one of those same superiors
*  who sat safe and pretty at the base as they forced Ivan against his will to the front line,
*  while tormenting him for not being a patriot, added his signature.
*  My friend, you've signed your own sentence now.
*  Immediately Ivan booked a flight to Moscow. He printed the papers he needed. The things
*  he didn't want found, like his international passport. He slipped into a compartment in his
*  backpack that usually contained a retractable rain covering, which he had gingerly cut out of
*  the lining. The border dance had to be executed carefully. Anton had repeatedly cautioned that
*  under no circumstances should Ivan use his international passport, or even admit to having
*  one, at the border between Russia and Belarus or at the Minsk airport, as it could provoke
*  additional checks. The most important crossing would be the exit from Minsk. The magazine is
*  withholding certain details of the route at the request of Edith Alesum. Belarus's borders were
*  where the security systems were the most synchronized with Russia's and where people had been detained.
*  But at the next airport in the next country he would be able to use his foreign passport to
*  board a flight to Istanbul. From Istanbul he would fly on to his final destination.
*  He did not have any of his flights booked in advance, so as not to light up the web.
*  He would book each leg as he approached it. If everything went according to plan,
*  he would arrive on Anna's birthday. Once Ivan got to Moscow, his closest childhood
*  friend helped him exchange rubles for American dollars. He took five thousand dollars in cash
*  and put the rest of his money in bitcoin. His friend had bought him a new phone,
*  but hadn't opened it. Ivan took his old phone to another friend's house and left it there.
*  They bought a new unregistered SIM card in the subway, took the train to another part of Moscow,
*  and turned the phone on, ensuring that the new one and the old one had never been next to each other.
*  Ivan opened a new Telegram account and subscribed to some pro-Russia channels to show how much he
*  loved Putin. They went to buy a train ticket. While they waited, Ivan noticed the police talking to
*  some of the people in line. Brother, calm down, his friend told him. He looked nervous as hell.
*  Ivan realized his hands were trembling. Each step matters. He went to the bathroom. He forced himself
*  to breathe. When he returned, the police were gone. He bought the ticket in cash and boarded.
*  It was a standard platz cart, the cheapest long-distance overnight option, with an open
*  carriage and rows of bunks. After all the stress and sleepless nights, Ivan fell asleep immediately.
*  He woke up to daylight and checked his phone. It was roaming. They had crossed into Belarus.
*  Another step down. His bunkmate came down from the top bed and they chatted over tea.
*  She told Ivan she was a civil servant. What about you? She asked. I'm a web designer, Ivan said.
*  I'm going on vacation with co-workers. Just saying the words aloud thrilled him. He wasn't just a web
*  designer, but a web designer who traveled, not a guy who posed for photo reports or killed people
*  in war. How long had he lurked on the precipice of that life? Ivan knew what happened when someone
*  deserted. At every evening meeting, the base's duty officer reported on the last 24 hours,
*  showing photo reports on the projector, including a slide that listed everyone who missed roll call
*  that morning. Other slides listed those who were on rotation somewhere, those at the SVO,
*  those with the dispensation to receive medical treatment, those who were on trips to take
*  200s from Rostov-on-Don and deliver the corpses to family members, and then those who were
*  unaccounted for. He knew that once his leave ended, his name would flash on the final slide.
*  Did you call his parents? the colonel would demand. Did you call his wife?
*  What does the wife say? Personnel department. What about the personnel file?
*  Where do his parents live? Did you send a request to send someone to their address?
*  Did they go there? Yes, they went to the address. What did they report? They said the parents are
*  out of the loop. They don't know where he is. He's not at the address. Ivan had seen the
*  scenario repeatedly. They all knew about the guy who had been hiding in Syria for months,
*  but like so much else in the Russian services, people tried not to talk about it. Another set
*  of guys had been AWOL and Donetsk somewhere for half a year. Every week their commander would call
*  them and ask where they were. Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there, they would answer, but never appear.
*  These were all unofficial deserters. Not that the Russian authorities released any formal figures.
*  No commanding officer wanted to officially declare a subordinate AWOL. He didn't want to
*  get knocked by his superior because he had lost so many men. So everyone was trying to solve the
*  situation on their own to avoid officially entering the soldier's name into the system.
*  A commander may even have already reported the guy to his superior, but that superior did not
*  want to have problems with his own superior, and so the two were in cahoots not to open a criminal
*  case. Under Russian law, a deserter must have the intent to desert. So a man could be away from base
*  for a long time and be charged with simply being AWOL, which carried a significantly shorter
*  sentence than desertion. And so even under mobilization, long after the two days beyond
*  which he could be declared AWOL had passed, or the eight more that carried a prison term of up to
*  five years, or even the twenty more after that that increased the punishment to seven years,
*  or even more than a month for a sentence of up to ten years, there was still no case at the military
*  prosecutor's office. A deserter might never be charged with desertion at all and could continue
*  receiving his full salary for months. Because Ivan was a captain, he assumed that the base's
*  FSB officer would be working on his case. Ivan knew the guy from school. How many times did we
*  go to each other's houses with our wives and children? He would call around to ask Ivan's
*  subordinates how they would characterize him, if he had any suspicious contacts, if he had any
*  contacts in Ukraine, what his call sign was, whether he had told anyone of his plans to desert,
*  whether he had expressed any opinions about the army or politics. Both before deployment and after
*  his return, Ivan had himself been involved in the hunt for missing soldiers. One commander would call
*  another and ask him to check the registered house of someone from their unit who had gone AWOL.
*  The commander would send his subordinates. Sometimes it was the military police,
*  but sometimes it was just normal soldiers, borrowed from another unit.
*  Everyone knew the routine. They could try a few times at different times of the day,
*  morning, evening, night. They would bang on the door and if no one answered,
*  they would stand outside the house or sit in their car and wait for the lights to come on.
*  Then they would report back what they saw.
*  There were instances when the soldiers simply didn't show up to the S.V.O. transport.
*  The base's military police or grunts from the base under other commanders would be dispatched to his
*  apartment. They would see the man inside, but they had no right to break into the house.
*  The soldier did not answer his phone, but there were methods to flush him out.
*  They could cut his electricity at the panel in the stairwell. Let's say the guy is sitting inside,
*  playing on the computer or something. He is surprised when the power fails and goes to check.
*  He walks out into the entryway and the men grab him. The hallway is in his apartment,
*  and there the military has the right to use a certain amount of physical force.
*  They take him, put him in the car, and bring him to the base commander.
*  The base commander takes over. The guy ends up at the S.V.O.
*  Ivan didn't spend time thinking about the morality of trying to flee despite sending other people to
*  the front line. This was the automatic reflex of a well-developed muscle of moral ambiguity.
*  That's not my area of expertise. I don't care why the person didn't show up for the service.
*  The mere fact of not reporting for duty is a violation. I'm just doing my job.
*  When Ivan got to the Minsk airport, he hung back, watching. This was the most crucial hurdle on the
*  first international airport border he had ever been to. Everyone passed through the two white
*  doors that led to the security screening. Beyond that was passport control. He called Anna.
*  I'm going. That's it, he told her. I'll call you later.
*  Once through security, he saw white cubicles with glass windows. Women sat looking through passports.
*  He stayed back again to watch. He spotted a woman who looked as though she was in her 40s with a
*  brown bob and a pleasant face. Her line was moving quickly, and she seemed to be barely
*  flipping through the pages. As he approached her, he breathed deeply. He told himself to be calm.
*  Smile. Hello, he said. Please remove your hat. Ivan took off his hat, smiling.
*  He passed her his domestic passport. Why domestic, she asked. Where's your foreign passport?
*  You can fly to—with the domestic one. I don't know about that, she told him.
*  I'm going to check. She got up and left him standing there. Ivan tried to stay calm. Around
*  him, people passed without any incident. Everyone click, click into the computer and out.
*  What is this absurdity? Why is she taking so long? You can use the domestic one, she said when she
*  returned. But do you have a foreign passport? No, I don't have a foreign passport. Of course not.
*  Domestic only. Only a domestic one. You don't have a foreign one by any chance.
*  Why are you suddenly asking that question so many times, Ivan wanted to scream. He started sweating.
*  No, he replied. It's just faster to register a foreign passport. No, I don't have one.
*  She started to type in his information, but then began hitting the same button over and over again.
*  My computer's freezing, she announced. Fuck, she is probably running me through the database,
*  which is causing the computer to freeze. It will say something like,
*  Do not let him out. He is a service member. He is forbidden to leave. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
*  Ivan began to shake. He focused all his energy on his hands and fingers, willing them to stay still.
*  He wiggled his toes up and down, up and down, so no one would see him fidgeting.
*  They're scanning a database right now, that's it. They're just going to arrest me now.
*  He waited, sweating, toes wiggling, wiggling.
*  What's going on, the woman asked a co-worker. Yeah, it's frozen for me too, her neighbor said.
*  It's the Russian passports. Ivan could not believe it. Were they going to let him pass,
*  take him to another room? His shirt was soaked. The woman kept hitting her keyboard. She reset
*  something, took Ivan's photo a second time, and ran him through again. Ivan waited. And then she
*  looked up at him from her computer and announced that he was free to pass. He was so dazed that he
*  couldn't figure out how the door worked. Finally, he was out and in the transit zone. He ran to the
*  bathroom and called Anna. I'm shaking, he told her, but I got through, I got through, that's it.
*  You can exhale now. Anna didn't believe it. Since Ivan left the base, she had been in a state of
*  constant dread. She didn't sleep. She forced herself to breathe, to watch Sasha. She thought
*  Ivan could be stopped at any moment. When he emerged from the bathroom, he chose a chair by
*  his gate and sat down. Damn, it's about time. I've been through the most important part, now
*  a little more. It was only on the plane, buckled into the seat, taking off, that Ivan felt he could
*  exhale. He was, in his mind, free. The rest of the steps were a formality. Everything mentally
*  complicated was done. The rest was physical. Just fly, land, fly, land, fly, land.
*  At the next airport, Ivan watched the sunrise. He nearly lost most of his money buying a fake
*  plane ticket from a charlatan. He used cash at an airport office to buy a multi-leg ticket all the
*  way through to his final destination, but when he looked at it closely, he saw that only the flight
*  to Turkey was confirmed. The rest were just reservations. Some opportunists thought Ivan was
*  a sucker who wouldn't notice until he was already on a layover. Ivan raised hell and threatened to
*  call the police until someone found the guy, who slinked around to offer what Ivan was sure was a
*  feigned apology, claiming that he didn't realize he hadn't really made the booking.
*  Anna was horrified. If Ivan hadn't been able to get the money back, they would have had nothing
*  left to spend on plane tickets. But also, was he insane? Did he want to involve the police and
*  flash his ID all over the CSTO? The flight to Istanbul was beautiful. Clouds and more clouds.
*  Ivan filmed it all. As the plane descended, he could see green water rippling around lush islands.
*  But then the pilot jerked them up violently and climbed back into the clouds.
*  I can't believe this is happening. A moron at Minsk passport control. A swindler at the next
*  airport. A plane mishap in Turkey. Just my luck. They circled for a while and then landed on their
*  second try. Ivan waited around all day in the enormous Istanbul airport, worried that his gate
*  would suddenly change and he would have to run across five concourses and end up missing his
*  next flight. When he eventually boarded, he fell asleep almost immediately. Exiting customs at his
*  final destination, Ivan couldn't really believe it. Finally. It's finally happening. It's happening.
*  It really worked. You were running from death. Did you really succeed? He walked out into the
*  arrivals hall. Anna and Sasha were waiting with a sign. Welcome, is said in the language of their
*  new country. In the video a friend took, Anna looked drunk, her features melting. She was balling,
*  her frame collapsing in on herself. Ivan enveloped her and whispered into her ear,
*  it's okay. It's okay. I'm here. I arrived. Calm down. It's okay. It's okay here.
*  Anna couldn't stop crying. She knew there was a whole road ahead of them that still needed to be
*  traversed. Status papers, safety, a new life. But Ivan was there. He was in front of her.
*  He stroked her hair. Anna had tasked herself with establishing their new lives in anticipation of
*  Ivan's escape. As soon as she arrived, she set about learning the language, figuring out how
*  to buy groceries, making friends, finding a daycare for Sasha. If each step Ivan took mattered,
*  each counterstep Anna took mattered just as much. The most important thing was to legalize their
*  existence. She needed to find the right lawyer to make sure they could receive protected status.
*  There were a lot of swindlers peddling assistance to the waves of desperate Russians who were
*  fleeing their country. Anna decided that they didn't just need refugee status, they needed
*  citizenship. An ironclad guarantee that they would never be sent back to Russian soil or have to set
*  foot in the Russian embassy for any reason ever again. But she couldn't just ask random Russians
*  she met for help. Besides, their asylum claim was more complicated than most. Ivan was not a
*  politically persecuted activist or someone who had fled a draft notice. He had been involved in
*  actual fighting. No matter how long other cases took, theirs would probably take longer.
*  Deserters were not in touch with one another either. Edith Alessem helped soldiers escape Russia,
*  but it was up to the individual to take it from there. They were almost entirely on their own.
*  She spent weeks trying to understand the most mundane nuances of the logistics of life in this
*  new place. Even renting an apartment was more difficult than she imagined. When she first
*  arrived she lucked out with a less than attentive landlord, but now they needed a bigger place,
*  and many listings required renters to have a local guarantor.
*  Anna saw the man's posts while scrolling telegram group chats for newly arrived Russians as she was
*  researching rental law. He was so nice, joking and offering advice to everyone about everything.
*  His thoughtful replies drew tons of likes and grateful comments. She wrote him a direct message
*  with a question about the guarantor system. Right away the man offered to call her to explain the
*  details. He laid everything out systematically, explained things she had spent hours puzzling
*  over. He was buoyant, made so many jokes and suggested they grab a coffee and talk some more.
*  Anna took Sasha. The man brought his pregnant wife. He made more jokes. They chatted and chatted
*  about the weirdness of this new life in exile. He asked her about Sasha's daycare. Is it a good one?
*  I'm going to need one soon, he said, nudging his wife and laughing. Anna told him everything she
*  knew about the education system. She was so happy to be useful, to share something back,
*  after he had spent so long on the phone explaining the property system to her.
*  After an hour and a half he took her phone and started making calls to real estate agents for her.
*  I speak the language, he said. Don't worry about it, it's easy for me.
*  He touched her arm, just a small gesture, but it meant so much.
*  Well, what's your deal? He asked when he was done making the calls. I know it's hard for you here.
*  Let me help you somehow. It doesn't cost me anything. I mean, really, people who know me
*  around here, they all say you're a wizard. Here comes the wizard, you know.
*  Anna thought they were still bantering. Don't you know there's no such thing as
*  wizards in real life, she asked. You just never met one in your life, he told her seriously.
*  But anything is possible here. The stress of the last year sat in her bones.
*  It curled inside the angry scars on her wrists. She looked at him in wonder, are there really
*  people in the world who just help without asking for anything in return?
*  She felt for the first time in so long that maybe she could have some relief.
*  Maybe he could find a way for them to get their paperwork done faster.
*  What's your status here, he asked. How are you going to get legalized?
*  I don't know, she told him. I thought about going to school to get a student visa,
*  maybe university, but I don't have the language. Look, that's a long time,
*  four years of school, he told her. Yeah, and we need to earn money to survive, too.
*  Damn, why is it so complicated, he asked her, commiserating. Who's your husband?
*  My husband is complicated. Why is it so hard, he asked, but she stayed quiet.
*  Did you get caught in the vortex or something with the war? Yes.
*  And war in general is bullshit. Fuck Putin, I've had so many friends end up there.
*  I helped them to escape the war. She looked at him. Our situation is so fucked, she whispered.
*  Shit, I know what you mean. I understand. Hey, is there anything I can do to help?
*  I've already helped my guys get out of there. Can I help you translate documents and paperwork?
*  I speak the language well. She promised to email him everything when she got home.
*  What about your husband, though, he asked again. Is he military?
*  Anna grew up amid Russia's Soviet hangover and came of age in Putin's Russia. Generations of
*  dictatorship had given way to renewed autocracy. She knew you didn't talk to strangers. Instead,
*  she burst into tears. My girl, calm down, it's okay. I understand, he told her. That Putin is a
*  bastard. She agreed. She started speaking generally about the war. All the horrible
*  things she felt about Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yeah, yeah, of course. But what's
*  going on with you, he asked kindly. Little by little she felt herself unfurling,
*  relaxing. The layers came off. She told him that her husband was military, that they fled the war,
*  that they barely made it here, that it was a miracle he had made it through Belarus,
*  that he had almost been swindled of their savings trying to buy plane tickets.
*  Really? Holy shit, oh my God, he exclaimed. Once she started, she kept talking.
*  She told him a lot of things. Not Ivan's name, but that he was an officer. All the trouble they had
*  been through, all the trouble he was in. It tumbled out of her without warning. She didn't even know
*  how badly she had needed to talk to someone. Well, of course, treason against the motherland.
*  He's looking at 20 to 25. The man wasn't joking around anymore. He was solemn, concerned. Okay,
*  let's think about how we can help him, he started. Okay, so now he's got a criminal case pending
*  against him. Let's say he gets new citizenship here, obtains some documents, and renounces
*  Russian citizenship. He tears it up. He doesn't fucking need it. He renounces his citizenship
*  altogether. How? In all her research, Anna had never heard of this. Wait, I'll tell you everything.
*  You and I are going to figure this out. It's possible. Yeah, it's complicated. Yeah, it's hard,
*  but it's all being solved. He paused. Everything can be solved only in a different way.
*  And then he looked at her and smiled. Gotcha. Anna didn't understand. Your husband is ours now.
*  What do you mean? I'm here for people like your husband. I live and work here for guys like your
*  husband. He took his cell phone and turned it to her, flashing his screen so quickly that she
*  couldn't quite make it out. A black screen with a red cross. Was that the GRU? I'm from this
*  organization, so let's go. Call him. Bring him to me. She barely understood what was happening.
*  She panicked. She stalled for time, trying to make sense of this. Who? She asked. Your husband. He
*  doesn't have a lot of options. Either he comes to me nicely. I'm going to supervise him here.
*  He's going to do certain tasks for me. Or do you know how it happens? What happens? People just
*  disappear. Here was a man walking down the street. The wrong car drove by and the man was gone. Today,
*  the man is there. Tomorrow, he is not. Anna squirmed in her chair. She looked at him and
*  didn't speak. She picked up a knife from the table. You're going to take the knife and stab
*  me in the neck like this, right? He taunted. I'd kill you right now, Anna replied. She called
*  to Sasha, who was absorbed in the cake the man bought for them. Let's go. Get ready, she said in
*  her calmest voice. Slowly, she started gathering their things. Well, come on. Call him. Don't waste
*  time, the man said. I'm waiting. Anna looked at the man squarely. You don't know my husband,
*  you bastard. What, were you trying to scare me to death? Do you know how much death I've seen this
*  year, you bastard? I will help every person who is running from this war. Did you hear me? I'll
*  help anyone because there shouldn't be people like you in this world. It's because of you this war is
*  happening, because of people like you. Anna was shaking, adrenaline mixed with rage awash with fear.
*  She threw money at the waiter, took her child by the hand and started walking. The man followed her
*  out. He grabbed her hand hard, not letting go. Calm down, calm down. Let's smoke. Calm down.
*  Anna pulled her hand away and steered Sasha toward a taxi.
*  By the time I met Anna in person a few months later, her wrists were red and welted. She had
*  been on the edge of happiness, but after the incident her fear had redoubled. She worried
*  that they would be found, that this man would send someone for Ivan. The secret of who they were,
*  what their life had been and the families they had left behind, the shadows stalked her.
*  Worse was the guilt, that she had been the one to give Ivan up. She had taken the happy ending
*  they worked so hard for and smashed it. At any minute he could be killed or hurt, and it was all
*  her fault for opening up, for being herself, for trusting in fairy tales. She spent days weeping in
*  bed. They wrote a detailed lesson about the incident. The group offered Anna a few consultations with a
*  volunteer psychologist who told her not to panic. The man was probably a grifter, one of the many
*  Russians who played on the community's fear to make a quick buck. He would probably just have
*  extorted them in return for his silence. But when Anna asked her new friends if they knew this guy,
*  they told her they thought he really was affiliated with the Russian Embassy.
*  He had been on the periphery of the diplomatic circle for years, operating in some gray area
*  that no one understood. Ivan wasn't sure what to think. He just knew Anna was terrified.
*  They started calling the man Misha Lyosha. Two generic Russian names as a joke, so his specter
*  would loosen its power over them. Whether Misha Lyosha was an agent of the Russian military
*  intelligence service or just a grifter was almost beside the point. They knew the Russian
*  state could reach them anywhere, or it wanted them to think it could. Either way, the result was the
*  same. They were silenced. After a detailed lesson put me in touch with Ivan, we chatted online until
*  one day he apologized and disappeared. Then, just as suddenly, a few weeks later he was back.
*  He explained that he had wanted to tell his story, but the incident with Misha Lyosha happened.
*  Anna grew scared and asked him to stop speaking to me. They moved apartments. They tried again
*  to change their lives. We agreed that I would keep the specifics of their biography vague enough so
*  as to protect their security. Anna was at war with herself. All she had wanted was her little life.
*  She didn't want their story publicized, but she knew it was important to Ivan, so she agreed.
*  After that situation, I wanted to flatten myself to the floor so no one could see or hear me,
*  she told me. I'm talking to you, and I realize internally, man, this is important.
*  And as they say, am I a quivering, miserable creature, or do I have rights?
*  That's the eternal question. Am I a quivering, miserable creature, or do I have rights?
*  No one could fault them for being afraid. Defection is dangerous. Inside and outside the country,
*  Russians who speak out against Putin end up dead. Seemingly unimportant individuals are hunted,
*  harassed, threatened, shot, thrown off balconies in the European Union or the United States.
*  Journalists, activists, people few have ever heard of have been poisoned,
*  beaten, had chemicals thrown in their faces. But the worst punishments are reserved for
*  former members of the regime who have died in any number of curious circumstances.
*  The higher the profile a person has, the greater the risk. A pilot who flew his helicopter into
*  Ukraine in a public relations coup for Kiev was found dead in Spain. His body, riddled with
*  bullets, was then run over by the assassin's car. As Dmitry Medvedev, the former president
*  and prime minister, put it, dogs die a dog's death. Was it the work of the regime or its
*  mafioso enthusiasts? Did it matter when you were dead? As a result, very few deserters from the
*  Russian military have spoken to the media. I reported this article in eight countries
*  across four continents and interviewed eighteen deserters. Many of those who fought in Ukraine
*  had been sent to the training exercise at the border in February 2022. As soon as they saw
*  war was happening, they started looking for ways out. I didn't have much of a choice,
*  one lieutenant explained. I wasn't told, so, look, either you go to lunch or we're going to
*  take over Ukraine. I was told to get in the car and drive. I was trapped. If I had gotten out when
*  we were crossing the Ukrainian border and run in the opposite direction, I would have been shot.
*  What could I have done? Killed my brigade commander? It wouldn't have made a difference.
*  Another brigade commander would just take his place. No matter how many people I ask,
*  what would you have done if you were in my position? They say, well, I would probably do
*  what you did. In the end, the lieutenant tried to break his own hand with a rock multiple times,
*  but couldn't manage to do it. Another man I interviewed organized a group of subordinates
*  to shoot one another in the thigh, shin, and arm. Others bided their time, returned on leave,
*  and ran away from their base. One of them lost his entire life savings to a huckster in Kazakhstan,
*  was forced to return to Russia, and fled the country a second time to Armenia.
*  His wife was against it. Everyone's going, she said. And you're a coward.
*  She stayed in Russia with their child and doesn't speak to him anymore.
*  I spoke to a young gay soldier who went from his military desk job to Pushkin Square in central
*  Moscow to protest on the day the full-scale invasion began. On that day, arrest would have
*  been life-destroying even for a civilian, to say nothing of an active duty service member in a
*  country that defines the LGBTQ movement as extremism. He tried to terminate his contract
*  even before the invasion, but his request wasn't granted, so he fled to Kazakhstan.
*  His boyfriend, a teacher, joined him later. Without a foreign passport, he stayed in hiding
*  with his partner in a conservative country where violence against the queer community is normal.
*  The couple lived in limbo for over a year without refugee status, unable to leave the CSTO,
*  with the daily fear of being pushed back into Russia and jailed, like Mikhail Zhilin,
*  the Federal Guard Service Officer, and Dmitry Setrikov, a deserter who Aditya Lesum reported
*  was tracked down and kidnapped in Armenia to be returned to Russia. One time, when the police
*  knocked on their door, the young man panicked so much that he started climbing out of the apartment's
*  third-story window. His boyfriend anxiously answered the door, preparing himself to face
*  imprisonment for abetting. The couple have since fled to safety, but many deserters remain stuck
*  in the CSTO. One young man who worked as a defense ministry videographer was sent to Ukraine twice and
*  couldn't figure out how to flee. His international passport, like Ivan's, was locked in a safe at his
*  base's human resources office. Thinking he had no other options, he decided to use the opportunity
*  to try to collect footage of Russian crimes for history. The deserters I spoke to who don't have
*  passports and are trapped in CSTO countries believe that their salvation is Europe or the
*  United States, but neither place will have them. Kamil Kasimov was arrested, forcibly returned to
*  Russia and sentenced to six years in prison for desertion. He worked for a rocket brigade that
*  launched missiles into Ukraine. He was deployed during the training exercise, but he didn't shoot
*  anything himself. He didn't know what they were doing, couldn't pinpoint where he had been,
*  and fled as soon as he worked up the nerve. In April 2024, the Russian and Kazakh authorities
*  went to the 23-year-old's place of work and detained him, holding him on a Russian base
*  in the south of Kazakhstan, where he was pressured to return to Russia to face charges.
*  It has become much more dangerous in Kazakhstan this year.
*  Artur Agustaf, his lawyer at the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and
*  Rule of Law, told me recently, We received unverified information that Kamil was not the
*  only one. There were also attempts to kidnap other deserters. Even having an international
*  passport did not guarantee salvation. I met one man at an outdoor cafe in Tbilisi,
*  where he chain-smoked nervously. He had avoided deployment for a year and a half.
*  When he was transferred to another unit and it looked as if he was about to be ordered to Ukraine,
*  he escaped. He left his wife and two children behind and did not know when he would be able
*  to see them again. He tried to apply for a humanitarian visa from the European Union.
*  He dropped his application off at embassy after embassy and received no reply. He bought a ticket
*  to Mexico that flew through Europe, planning to claim asylum in the EU as the Germans had promised,
*  but he was stopped from boarding the plane despite having a valid passport.
*  I often think about whether I should have done this, he told me over telegram months after we
*  met. I don't know anymore. I'm stuck and scared. At my most difficult moments I think maybe I
*  should have just gone to prison in Russia. At least there would have been an end date to my sentence.
*  He wondered if he should use his remaining money to try to actually get to Mexico
*  and cross the U.S. border on foot. Deserters have told me recently that Russians are being
*  taken off flights to Mexico despite being allowed visa-free travel. After over a year
*  of hiding in Georgia, the man recently arrived in the EU. It's impossible to know the real
*  statistics of desertion. MediaZona, an independent investigative outlet in exile,
*  says there have been almost 7,400 AWOL cases in military courts since the start of mobilization,
*  but experts agree that's only a fraction of the number who have tried to escape.
*  Aditya Lesam has helped around 1,500 military men flee the country. The Russian authorities,
*  meanwhile, have made it more and more difficult to avoid service. Last year, the authorities raised
*  the maximum age of conscription to 30 from 27, which will increase the number in the pool to
*  at least 700,000 by 2025. A military summons no longer has to physically reach a person.
*  Sending it electronically is enough. People who ignore the summons for more than 20 days
*  lose the right to drive a car, get a loan, and buy or sell property. Despite this, the number of
*  deserters continues to rise. This March, according to MediaZona, Russian military courts sentence a
*  record 34 men per day. The growth in 2024 is unprecedented, it wrote. Soldiers most frequently
*  receive suspended sentences so they can return to base, apologize, and be sent straight back to the
*  front line. In May, Putin replaced Defense Minister Shoigu with Andrey Belosov, first deputy prime
*  minister and one of his most trusted economic advisors. The reshuffle showed how intertwined
*  the military and economy had become, and how committed Putin remained to waging a long-term
*  war. Analysts saw it as an attempt to clean up military corruption once and for all,
*  or at least to signal that the regime was trying. For two years, Putin had tolerated military bloggers
*  criticizing the Ministry of Defense for corruption and poor management, as long as they did not
*  implicate the Kremlin itself. Many saw this as a check on the military, a productive release
*  vow for frustration with the war, as well as a well-honed tactic pitting parts of the regime
*  against one another as each tries to win Putin's favor, a trademark of his 24-year reign. The Wagner
*  founder Yevgeny Prokofiev's sin was to openly challenge Putin's rule. For this, his plane was
*  exploded in the sky. The Kremlin continues to rely on the age-old strategy of throwing waves of
*  infantry at the front, and the casualty toll is now astronomical. During a Russian push for
*  territory this May, British intelligence estimated that roughly 1,250 Russian soldiers were killed
*  or injured each day, and that up to half a million Russians have been killed or wounded
*  since the beginning of the invasion. Still, Russia continues to recruit 25,000 to 30,000 soldiers per
*  month, about the same number that leave the battlefield as casualties. Last year's increased
*  recruitment drive, which included 50,000 male and female convicts, as well as people who previously
*  would have been exempt for mental or physical impairments, allowed the Russians to continue
*  to stabilize the force. According to the policy group ReRussia, from July 2023 to July 2024,
*  the Russian regime has paid families of those killed and wounded approximately $34 billion.
*  Roughly 8% of the federal budget. Ukraine, meanwhile, is running out of weapons and troops.
*  Ukrainian military casualties are a closely guarded secret. The most recent estimate of 31,000 is
*  definitely an undercount. More than 11,500 civilians have been killed in two and a half years of war,
*  including at least 600 children. Russian troops have been accused of rape, torture, and extrajudicial
*  executions. A generation of Ukrainians are growing up in bomb shelters. The Russian regime
*  has spent at least $211 billion to inflict this horror. In August, Kyiv brought the war home to
*  Russia, the first time the country has been invaded since World War II. The Ukrainians launched a
*  surprise attack, shocking Western officials and quickly pushing seven miles into Russia.
*  They took prisoners, including hundreds of babyface conscripts who were manning the border
*  and surrendered in droves, rekindling memories of Chechnya and Afghanistan. Ukraine would come to
*  control at least 28 towns and villages, while the Russians would evacuate more than 132,000 people.
*  If Ukraine's current story is being told as one of resilience, Russia's has been cast as a tale of
*  bottomless moral passivity. Indeed, acquiescence is its own form of tacit support. For decades,
*  the Russian had been a faceless evil in the American psyche. This time, it seems the reputation
*  was deserved. A terrible country fighting a terrible war. I had spoken to deserters online
*  before I met one of them in person for the first time in a park in Tbilisi. I was apprehensive,
*  worried that I would be followed and expose someone, or that I would meet an FSB plant and
*  endanger myself. I arrived early to check the area and saw a lanky young man sitting on a bench.
*  He was more afraid of me than I was of him. He had been a lieutenant when the invasion began.
*  He feigned a suicide attempt, got himself locked up in a mental institution, was threatened with
*  torture and with being chained to the commander's radiator, was told he would be killed, and was
*  then ostracized by his own family for refusing to deploy to Ukraine. The lieutenant had never been
*  out of the country, so he plotted to leave methodically, making lists of the things he
*  would need to pack, down to a precise number of socks. Then one night he vanished from his base,
*  from his life, into the complete unknown. Now here he was in an empty park,
*  meeting someone who messaged him online, claiming to be a journalist.
*  When a person says I'm a deserter, a coordinator of Intransit, a secretive network based in Germany
*  that helped smuggle activists out of Russia told me, people think they are just afraid and that's it.
*  They don't understand the remarkable things that they've done. They're not only victims,
*  but many of them are really heroes, and they need support.
*  I spoke to quite a few men like this, whose stories contained less moral ambiguity than Ivan's.
*  They either left after being forced to fight in the initial invasion, or tried unsuccessfully to
*  break their contracts and then fled. I could have written an article about any one of them,
*  but Ivan's story painted a more representative picture of the Russian servicemen.
*  Patriotism is often not the main motivation to fight. It's money. And generally, for Russians,
*  if the war doesn't touch their family, they try to ignore it. There is a nationwide desire to eat
*  the fish and sit on the dick. More gracefully and graciously, it could be described as avos,
*  a word for the Russian attitude of ignoring the possibility of negative outcomes,
*  with the belief that luck predetermines the result anyway.
*  Three men in Kazakhstan, Alkustov, the human rights lawyer, and two former service members,
*  worked together to verify stories of deserters in anticipation that this status might one day
*  qualify them for residency in the EU. This is done to address the concern of European politicians,
*  which in transit and a detailessom have encountered that such a decision would invite spies, killers,
*  or Russian patriots into their countries. They hear deserter testimonies in video calls
*  and review supporting paperwork to write reports to share with human rights organizations
*  that petition foreign affairs ministries. I told all three of them an abridged version of Ivan's
*  story. Each had a different interpretation. When he was shown the combat order, he did not refuse it,
*  said Alexei Alshansky, the warren officer who used Photoshop to alter uniforms,
*  and who is now an analyst at the conflict intelligence team. On the day he was shown
*  the combat order, he could have left to Kazakhstan. He was not a wanted man yet. All this time,
*  while he was telling you how he was walking around, agonizing, suffering, looking for solutions,
*  writing reports, all this time he could calmly leave. This is a man who had every opportunity
*  to not go to this war, not go to jail, and keep himself and his family safe. But he made the
*  decision to go to war. How do you morally treat this? Bad. You can't demand some kind of heroism
*  from people, Alkustov interjected. We must remember one thing. We cannot shift responsibility from the
*  politicians who make decisions and the generals who execute them onto the soldiers. The third man,
*  the lieutenant who had been deployed to Ukraine during the initial invasion, and had tried and
*  failed to break his own hand with a rock, and who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal,
*  told me, a person who was brought up and raised in a military family, then had the goal of
*  graduating from a military school, becoming an officer, cannot say anything about it,
*  school, becoming an officer, cannot see himself without military service. He will never dare to
*  leave Russia. He will never be able to break that core, he continued with admiration. That's a hero.
*  This is truly a man who has transcended himself and, in my opinion, made the right choice.
*  He was brought up with the conviction that Russia and the army are everything in life. He doesn't
*  see himself without it, and if he dared to do it, he overstepped himself.
*  When I met Ivan, I was struck by his earnestness. He had a sincere desire to better himself and
*  his life. His candor seemed born of genuine guilelessness. He was personable, funny, and
*  warm, and he spoke of his self-interest openly. When we discussed attending funerals or presenting
*  the coffins of fallen soldiers to their families, Ivan was honest. He didn't go to the services of
*  the men who perished under his command, and he didn't want to, whether it was his duty as the
*  platoon commander or not. Officially, a military representative must attend a soldier's funeral.
*  Though it's not obligatory, it's considered honorable behavior for the commander to be the
*  one present. I thought maybe we were having a miscommunication in Russian, but he assured
*  me that he didn't feel a moral obligation. It seemed to me it was because it wasn't his war,
*  but he never even tried to make that excuse. That would be the right thing to do, but not everything
*  that is right is what we want to do, he told me. If there was an option not to go, I wouldn't.
*  This is the moral morass of a nation. Still, Ivan spent ages looking for a piece of paper that had
*  all his platoon members' names on it so he could show it to me. He tried to reconstruct the list
*  for months after I left. He didn't know the name of the engineer whose body they left by the crater,
*  and this really bothered him. He wanted me to write about the soldiers he lost, to use their
*  real call signs, to commemorate these men who behaved heroically toward their comrades in arms.
*  He worried that it wasn't his place to publicize their names, but he also wanted their sacrifice
*  to be known. Apricot the machine gunner. If it wasn't for him, things could have been even worse,
*  Ivan said. This man really acted heroically. He didn't go anywhere. He didn't retreat. He started
*  to cover us. He gave the rest of us a chance to jump into that hole. Apricot is survived by two
*  daughters and a common-law spouse. Because they were not officially married, his wife did not
*  receive the coffin payment. Ivan protected the men he could, as long as it did not risk his own
*  safety. He never sent one of his subordinates to the S.V.O. against his will. When he told me that,
*  he wasn't saying it to show off or to justify himself. He was direct and matter of fact.
*  He openly admitted that he helped send others to the front. This did not strike him as problematic.
*  Ivan shared hundreds of pages of documents that supported his account. He showed me photographs
*  that he had taken and that had been taken of him throughout his life, and we read his personal chat
*  history together. All day, every day for a week, we sat in a hotel conference room and reviewed his
*  life. Anna did not want me to go into their house. To tell your story to a journalist in such
*  excruciating detail requires a confounding mix of blind faith, bravery, trust, and total self-
*  disregard. The hours we spent going over details and Ivan being asked, but why didn't you X?
*  Was its own kind of torture. A confessional with no absolution. Perhaps Ivan felt he was performing
*  penance, but he said he simply wanted to save other Russian officers from repeating his fate.
*  I also verified parts of his story with two service members from his base.
*  Look, basically everyone involved is a murderer in one way or another, Ivan said.
*  I realized that each of us, each Russian, is involved in this. Every one of us participated.
*  We have allowed this old man to be in power for so many years,
*  and there's also this anger that I had to quit. My contract was almost over. It was officially the
*  end of the contract. I should have been a civilian by now, and all my plans, my whole life was ruined
*  by this old grandfather, Vladimir Vladimirovich. What right does he have to control my life?
*  When he looked back on it all, Ivan couldn't believe that there were still people in Russia
*  who knew full well what was going on, what their future could hold, and yet stayed. Not because
*  they supported the war, but because they genuinely continued to believe that it wouldn't affect them.
*  For so many years, Putin had offered them all protection, and now they just wanted to keep their
*  heads down. A stupor of an existence. A vos. This learned in difference to the obvious,
*  to the grinding of the bones of their own. Ivan's parents, for whom Putin remained sacred,
*  his friends outside the services who just wanted to live their lives without being bothered by
*  anything else, all fervent patriots, criminals, and regime opponents alike perished at the front.
*  What remains of the country's opposition is now in exile, where they have been joined by those who
*  awakened from this torpor. Over and over again for generations, Russia's greatest strength has been
*  its habit of destroying itself, and the regime endures. Anna and Ivan grew up under the reign
*  of Vladimir Vladimirovich. They had never participated in a real election, never thought
*  much about what the Kremlin did or didn't do overseas. Their parents' generation had sleepwalked
*  into autocracy, too exhausted to protest. They focused on trying to stay alive amid the turbulence
*  of changes no one prepared them for. Unlike them, Anna and Ivan came of age in an era of booming oil
*  prices and optimism. They had big plans for their small life. The Russian army offered a path to
*  socioeconomic stability. There was no shame in serving the homeland. They worked hard to buy an
*  apartment, to improve their circumstances, to have a child, but their dreams would be destroyed by
*  much larger geopolitical machinations. They would, like many of their compatriots, practice a kind of
*  self-mutilating patience that cost them everything they cherished most. Now they lived in the twilight
*  of perpetual anxiety, a paranoia that was impossible to fully shake. Small, ordinary milestones became
*  minefields. The first time Sasha got bullied, a classmate said Russians were all evil, and Sasha
*  came home crying. Anna tried to explain that her child, who loved kittens and made it a point to
*  hug the principal every day, had no responsibility for this war. But Sasha brought up Ivan's military
*  uniform. What of the last two years did their child remember? How much would they tell Sasha one day?
*  For how many generations should guilt travel?
*  This was never a story about heroes or bravery, a valiant victor or a helpless victim.
*  From the beginning, Ivan wanted me to make that clear.
*  It is a story about the dangers of an act of independence after a life of conformity,
*  and about how defection from Putin's system is a sentence without end.
