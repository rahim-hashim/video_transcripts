# Israelâ€™s Far Right Government Backs Down
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UL3T4Cgr4M)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  For weeks in Israel, the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu has been pushing a highly
*  controversial plan to fundamentally change the country's Supreme Court.
*  It led to some of the largest protests in Israel's history.
*  On Monday, Netanyahu announced he was pausing it.
*  Today, Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley explains Netanyahu's surprising concession.
*  It's Wednesday, March 29th.
*  Patrick, when we last spoke, it really looked like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  was pressing ahead with this very polarizing plan to change the country's Supreme Court.
*  On Monday, we find out he's pressed pause.
*  So how did we reach this point just 17 days later that Netanyahu has started to back down?
*  We reached this point because the government set itself the arbitrary deadline of this
*  week.
*  This week is the last week of the winter session of the Israeli parliament, and they wanted
*  to get at least part of their judicial overhaul onto the law books by the end of that session.
*  The goal of the overhaul was to limit the power of the Supreme Court, limit the influence
*  of the judiciary on the selection of new judges, and to give the government more power over
*  who gets to be a judge on the Supreme Court.
*  Which of course would be an enormous historic change in Israel.
*  Yes, it would be a big change.
*  The Supreme Court is one of the few checks on the government's power.
*  Since the current government is the most right-wing government in Israeli history, there are fears
*  among the centrist and left-wing opposition that removing the court's restrictions on
*  government would give enormous power to the ruling coalition that would allow it to potentially
*  pave the way to some kind of authoritarian rule.
*  At least that's the fear.
*  The closer and closer we got towards the enactment of this overhaul, the higher those stakes
*  fell both to those who opposed it and to those who supported it.
*  Among the opponents, perhaps the most influential group were the soldiers in the military reserve,
*  because more and more of them stopped reporting for duty, and more of them started threatening
*  that they would not turn up for duty if the overhaul went ahead.
*  And their resistance was so significant because while reservists are a small minority of those
*  who serve in the Israeli military, they do perform an important role in certain sectors
*  of the military, in particular the Air Force.
*  A large proportion of those who fly fighter jets and bombers for the Israeli Air Force
*  are reservist pilots.
*  And Patrick, remind me why in particular these military reservists objected?
*  Well, there's a bunch of reasons why they were resistant to the judicial overhaul.
*  There were concerns that by fighting on behalf of a far-right administration, they might
*  be ordered to do things that they considered to be immoral or illegal.
*  And that in particular grew to be a concern after one far-right minister several weeks
*  ago called for a Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank to be wiped out.
*  And that sent shockwaves, particularly through the reserve pilots, who feared maybe at some
*  point in the future that some kind of similar order might be made to them.
*  And there was also a self-serving component of that.
*  They were concerned that if the Supreme Court was weakened, there would be growing calls
*  outside Israel for international courts to prosecute Israeli soldiers for alleged war crimes.
*  Interesting.
*  I mean, that makes sense, right?
*  That the Israeli military would feel that the stakes were pretty high for them.
*  Well, more and more reservists started to say they wouldn't report for duty.
*  And there were fears within the military leadership that this would soon affect operational
*  capacity.
*  And the commanders of the military began to warn politicians that they were close to having
*  to reduce the scope of certain operations.
*  And they were also concerned that the fears and low morale among reservists was beginning
*  to spread to the soldiers on active duty.
*  And the defense minister, Yoav Galant, the man who oversees the military, began to come
*  under increasing pressure.
*  People were protesting outside his house, in particular former naval commandos who he
*  served with.
*  Pilots were beginning to text Mr. Galant's personal phone, telling him that they were
*  deciding to stand down from reserve duty.
*  And all this prompted him on Saturday evening to do something very unusual.
*  He came out and gave a televised speech.
*  He says, I come to you as a patriot.
*  I have risked my life dozens of times for the state of Israel.
*  And he says the judicial overhaul needed to be paused, to be delayed, that it has become
*  a threat to Israeli national security because of the turmoil that it had caused within the
*  military.
*  Okay, so here we have a member of Netanyahu's own cabinet saying that this reform is a threat
*  to Israeli security.
*  And I'm assuming that this man in particular, the defense minister, is pretty important,
*  right, in the state of Israel?
*  Yes.
*  This is a country that has a myriad of enemies.
*  It's running an occupation of millions of Palestinians in the West Bank.
*  So the defense of the country is one of the central themes of Israeli discourse.
*  And when someone like the defense minister comes out and says that the security of the
*  state is in danger and it received wide coverage in the media, it's a bombshell.
*  So Patrick, what happened next?
*  Well for just over a day there was silence from Netanyahu.
*  On Sunday night, his office releases a one-line statement saying that Yov Galen has been fired.
*  And there's no reason given, but the message is clear.
*  If you speak out against this overhaul, you're fired.
*  Almost immediately, the country erupted.
*  Thousands of people went out into the streets blocking highways, some of them lighting fires
*  in the road.
*  I arrived at about 2 a.m. early on Monday morning on my bicycle outside the Israeli
*  parliament in West Jerusalem.
*  I saw the extraordinary sight of hundreds, if not thousands of protesters chanting democracy,
*  democracy, democracy, banging on drums, honking on horns, holding cartoons of Netanyahu under
*  the slogan dictator.
*  We've seen people protesting in Israel for months now, but nothing on the scale of what...
*  All the while, the head of the country's main union was dropping a heavy hint that there
*  would be a general strike in protest.
*  We're talking healthcare employees, transit workers, banking employees, even a doctor's
*  union is planning to walk off the job today.
*  It was absolute pandemonium and it continued on Monday morning.
*  Nearly everything, almost as far as we understand, is on strike.
*  With the general strike being put in place, the country's main airport being shut down
*  to all outgoing flights, most non-emergency healthcare was stopped.
*  In some places, trash collectors stopped collecting trash, malls were shut, banks were shut, and
*  protesters began to gather outside the Israeli parliament.
*  The country's political turmoil rapidly deepening.
*  So it was a huge outpouring of emotion and it was also coordinated in a way that protests
*  in Israel has rarely ever been to that extent.
*  It was a social movement that has few comparisons in Israeli history.
*  So at this point, Patrick, we're in Monday.
*  It's a full-on emergency.
*  So if you're Netanyahu and you're seeing this, what are you thinking?
*  Well in a nutshell, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place.
*  On the one hand, his opponents in the street had shut down the country and were threatening
*  serious economic harm.
*  And on the other hand, his coalition includes some real hardliners that resolutely believe
*  in the need for this judicial overhaul.
*  And they didn't want to back down.
*  So basically, the prime minister is essentially choosing between remaining in power and preserving
*  his coalition.
*  And what looks like at that point, the viability of the state of Israel, really, which is not
*  a good position to be in.
*  Yes, that's exactly right.
*  As one analyst said to me, it was a lose-lose situation.
*  And throughout Monday afternoon, everyone was wondering what on earth is he going to
*  do?
*  As right-wing protesters, as pro-government protesters began to announce plans to hold
*  counter demonstrations, raising the risk of physical confrontations between the two political
*  camps in the streets.
*  He did issue a short statement telling both sides to be peaceful.
*  But then again, afterwards, he went dark.
*  And for a man who's known for his speeches, for his loquaciousness, for being one of the
*  best political communicators in the world, he was uncharacteristically silent.
*  And then finally, shortly after seven o'clock, we received another message saying that he
*  was going to speak at five past eight, a speech to the nation.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Patrick, we left off at a really critical moment.
*  Netanyahu is poised to deliver a speech and protesters are literally at his doorstep.
*  What does he say?
*  He acknowledges how angry and divided people are and how the country is on the brink, in
*  his words, of civil war.
*  He says, when there's a possibility of preventing a civil war through dialogue, I, as the Prime
*  Minister, take a time out for dialogue.
*  And he says, we're going to postpone this judicial overhaul and that he's not going
*  to push for a vote this week.
*  But at the same time, he says that the overhaul will take place in some form during the next
*  session of the Israeli parliament during the summer.
*  But he also makes a point of saying that he wants to enhance individual rights in Israel.
*  And that's a concession to the demands of some protesters who fear that the undermining
*  of judicial authority will harm minorities.
*  And that last comment from him was a nod towards that concern.
*  And what was the reaction to his announcement?
*  We have two camps, right?
*  The protesters and Netanyahu's right-wing cabinet.
*  Some of his cabinet members, particularly the ones from his own party, were more conciliatory.
*  They seemed to understand the need for at least some kind of delay.
*  But there were others, particularly those who were not from his own party, who seemed
*  to really be digging their heels in.
*  One of them, Itamar Ben-Gurvir, who we've talked about in a previous episode, was particularly
*  vocal in public about the fact that the overhaul needed to pass.
*  And if Ben-Gurvir walked, then he could take his party with him.
*  And Netanyahu would lose his majority in parliament.
*  And that could lead to a government collapse.
*  Right.
*  So very high stakes for Netanyahu here.
*  And what about the protesters?
*  How do they see it?
*  For most protesters, it wasn't enough.
*  They all want to either see the proposal scrapped entirely or to be changed to prevent the government
*  from having control over who gets to be a judge.
*  And to also make sure that the Supreme Court retains its independence.
*  They don't quite buy that the delay will be used to hold negotiations and mediations.
*  And they fear that after the parliamentary recess ends in late April, the government
*  will just carry on regardless.
*  Nevertheless, the leader of the country's leading union has called off the general strike.
*  And around the country today, there is a sense of everyone having pulled back from the brink.
*  So it sounds like Netanyahu has, in fact, you know, gotten himself some breathing room.
*  Not a lot.
*  And if he decides, Patrick, to push this reform through, as he's suggesting he will in a few
*  weeks, and as his far right cabinet is demanding, presumably we'll be right back where we were
*  earlier this week, right?
*  With protesters shutting down large parts of the country.
*  So what's really changed here?
*  In a sense, nothing has fundamentally changed.
*  All that's changed is that we have delayed by a few weeks the crescendo of this whole
*  situation.
*  And we have a clearer sense of what the protesters could do if the government goes ahead in full
*  with the overhaul.
*  They've named their price.
*  They can close down airports, roads, ports.
*  They've shown their power.
*  And next time they could show that power with even greater force.
*  And Netanyahu will have to worry about this happening again and again if he keeps pushing
*  towards overhauling the judiciary.
*  I mean, it really has been a pretty extraordinary display of public anger and power, right?
*  From a huge swath of Israeli society.
*  From people of many different walks of life, as you say.
*  And they did this very rare thing.
*  They forced their leader to back down.
*  If only, you know, for a short time.
*  Like, what do you make of that?
*  Well, it suggests that there's a group of people who are opposed to this overhaul for
*  this has become an almost existential fight.
*  In one sense, this is a technical battle about the shape of the judiciary that might sound
*  a little bit procedural for people outside Israel.
*  But for many Israelis on both sides, this is about what kind of version of Israel they
*  are going to live in.
*  And for the opponents of the overhaul, they feel that their Israel, the one that's a bit
*  more secular, the one that's more moderate, is slipping away.
*  They come from all sorts of backgrounds, but they tend to lean secular.
*  And they fear that the religious community in Israel, put simply, is growing faster than
*  they are.
*  And they fear being outnumbered.
*  And they also feel that the country needs them.
*  They pay taxes.
*  They serve in the military.
*  And they feel that one of the communities that is driving the overhaul, the ultra-orthodox
*  section of society, they pay less taxes.
*  They're more likely to study religious texts than they are to serve in the military.
*  And so the secular leaning protesters feel like they're being dictated to by a group
*  in society that they're subsidizing and that they're also protected and that they feel
*  that in exchange, they should be listened to.
*  What will it mean to all these people if in a couple of weeks, they lose this battle
*  and the judicial reform actually goes through?
*  I think a lot of them would feel like they're living in a country that's no longer theirs,
*  where their rights are no longer going to be protected by the one institution, the Supreme
*  Court, that they felt was on their side.
*  But the flip side is also true, that if the overhaul doesn't go ahead, then the other
*  side of the country, the ones from a slightly more religious background on the whole, they
*  will also feel like this isn't their country, that they can win an election like they did
*  last November.
*  And even then, their goals and their priorities are not taken into account.
*  And that will leave us with a situation where at least one half of the country is going
*  to feel like it's not living in a place that it can recognize as their own.
*  And when you have divides like that, that's why you start hearing from commentators and
*  politicians and leaders that there's a risk of civil war.
*  Now that might be hyperbole, but it illustrates the kind of tension and lack of agreement
*  about the direction that Israel should be going in.
*  On the other hand, it also opens up the possibility of some kind of resolution, some kind of positive
*  outcome from all of this mess, because you can end a dispute through force, or you can
*  end it by coming together and trying to work out what your shared values are.
*  That concept a few days ago felt very unlikely, as protests surged into the streets on the
*  one hand and right-wing lawmakers vowed to surge onwards with their legislative blitz
*  on the other.
*  It's something that people are talking about more and more, that this could be a moment
*  where two sides could come together and hammer out some kind of shared vision.
*  And the framework for that is in place.
*  We have a period now where people from all factions can come together.
*  We have mediated the president, Isaac Herzog, who's put his hand up and said he's prepared
*  to oversee some of those discussions.
*  And so you have a time period, you have a mechanism, and you have an existential need
*  for this to happen.
*  And that's why some people think this could be the moment.
*  But then again, the divisions are already so wide that it may prove impossible to bridge them.
*  Patrick, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  On Tuesday, President Biden said that Israel cannot, quote, continue down this road and
*  added that it remained to be seen whether Netanyahu would act in a way that would achieve
*  genuine compromise.
*  Netanyahu responded, saying that while the two leaders had known each other for 40 years,
*  Israel makes its decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from
*  abroad.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Tuesday, at least 39 people were killed and 29 others seriously injured when a fire
*  broke out at a migrant detention center in northern Mexico near El Paso.
*  Mexico's president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said the men held at the facility had been
*  angry at the authorities, possibly because they had learned that they were going to be
*  deported.
*  They put mattresses at the door and set them on fire in protest.
*  The fatal blaze comes as border cities across Mexico have seen an increase in migrants hoping
*  to cross to the US after a pandemic era public health rule expires in May.
*  And a federal judge in Washington has ordered former Vice President Mike Pence to appear
*  in front of a federal grand jury that is investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020
*  election.
*  It was the latest setback to bids by Trump's legal team to limit the scope of questions
*  that prosecutors can ask witnesses in separate investigations into his efforts to maintain
*  his grip on power.
