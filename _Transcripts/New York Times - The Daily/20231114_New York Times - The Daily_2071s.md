# Hamasâ€™s Bloody Arithmetic
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69yDDhDFSh4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, to much of the outside world, Hamas's decision to murder hundreds of Israelis and
*  trigger a war that has since killed many thousands of its own people looks like a historic miscalculation,
*  one that could soon result in the destruction of Hamas itself.
*  My colleague Ben Hubbard has been reporting on that decision and the deliberate calculations
*  that went into it.
*  Ben, since October 7, since Hamas breached Israel's border and killed 1,200 people,
*  according to Israel, the vast majority of them civilians, I think a really important
*  question has largely gone unanswered, which is why?
*  Why undertake such a horrifying terror attack that entailed the mass murder of noncombatants?
*  And why do that when Hamas had to understand on some level that it would trigger an overwhelming
*  reprisal from Israel that would end the lives of so many Palestinian civilians, which is
*  exactly what's happened.
*  This was a highly planned and highly organized attack that clearly had a strategy behind
*  it.
*  So what was it?
*  That's what I set out to understand.
*  After the attack, I think everybody was asking that question of why would Hamas, which is
*  sort of ruling in Gaza and has this control, and why would they suddenly do something like
*  this that was actually described by one of my colleagues as a suicide attack on itself?
*  Basically, was the movement trying to destroy itself?
*  And so we wanted to sort of figure out, you know, how did Hamas get to the point in terms
*  of capabilities where it could launch this, which was a much, much more sophisticated
*  and complicated attack than we had ever seen them carry out before, despite the decades
*  and decades that they've been fighting Israel.
*  And then also, why?
*  How did they get to the point where they made the decision that of the kinds of attacks
*  do for whatever it is that they wanted to achieve?
*  Why this?
*  Not a very easy thing to answer.
*  It's completely unrealistic that we would be able to call up the leaders of Hamas in
*  Gaza who plotted and carried out this attack.
*  I mean, certainly by the time that we were asking this question, they were hiding away
*  in their bunkers somewhere, getting ready to fight Israel, which was making it very
*  clear it was going to do a ground incursion.
*  So there's sort of no way to talk to these people.
*  But Hamas has leaders in other places.
*  You have the people in Gaza who sort of run the show there, and then they have people
*  from their more political operations who are based in other parts of the Middle East.
*  There's a number of them who are in Beirut.
*  There's a number of them who are in Qatar.
*  So I packed my bags and left Istanbul and first went to Beirut.
*  With the understanding that you could meet with them, I think it would surprise people
*  to think that you can just meet with the senior leaders of Hamas.
*  Yeah, I mean, they're sort of like political people from any other political party.
*  They have offices and they have aides and you call them up and you take an appointment
*  and you figure out where you're going to meet them and you go to the office.
*  And so we got in touch with a number of them and they said, yeah, come in and we'll have
*  a chat.
*  And they told us to meet them at this restaurant that's kind of well known in the suburbs of
*  Beirut.
*  And we actually got in their car and they drove us to this sort of compound where we
*  We went in with a sort of big metal gate that opens when you go in.
*  And we went in and we just basically sat in a room with some couches and we talked.
*  And then a few days later, I went to Doha, capital of Qatar, sort of on the other side
*  of the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.
*  Again, we get in touch with the Hamas officials that we know are there.
*  And the first person that we talked to was actually an aide to Ismail Haniyeh, who was
*  the head of Hamas.
*  And he says, well, let's meet at Sheraton.
*  The hotel sort of on the waterfront.
*  And so, you know, I go there and we meet and have a long chat with him asking him basically
*  all about sort of the attack and before the attack and why the attack.
*  And then we actually get in his car and he drives us to the Hamas office.
*  It's in sort of a nice villa in an affluent neighborhood, kind of on the outskirts of
*  the city, has a big wall around it.
*  No sign, no indication to anybody coming by sort of who is there, who works there.
*  We meet one of the members of sort of the senior leadership body, the Politburo, Khalil
*  Haniyeh.
*  And again, we're sitting in a large room with, you know, couches and somebody brings us tea
*  and coffee and we start talking.
*  And after you have all these conversations with these leaders of Hamas, what did they
*  tell you about this question of why?
*  This question that you have come here to try to understand the logic of this attack, if
*  we can apply that word to what happened.
*  The basic idea that they all kept coming back to is they felt that the Palestinian
*  cause was basically fading away, that there were aspects of this conflict that were approaching
*  a point of no return.
*  And if they sort of passed that point, then it was all over.
*  And also this feeling that nobody really cared.
*  Nobody was really paying attention or doing anything about it, including the Israelis,
*  that the Israelis just didn't even seem to be thinking about the Palestinian cause anymore.
*  So they felt that they needed to do something big.
*  They need to do something dramatic to blow up the status quo.
*  They wanted to completely overthrow the situation in the region.
*  And individual leaders said that they hoped that this led to a big regional war, that
*  that was like the ideal outcome and hoped that some new option would emerge from what
*  came after.
*  So what they're telling you is they needed in their minds to light a fire and not a
*  small fire.
*  They wanted to light a conflagration.
*  And I'm wondering if that means for them that any death toll on both sides was therefore
*  worth it.
*  Well, I asked them about that, everybody that I talked to, and they give pretty much all
*  counts incredibly unsatisfying answers.
*  When you ask about the civilian Israelis who were killed in their communities, they
*  basically deny it and say either it's not true, this is Israeli propaganda, or they
*  say that if any civilians were killed, they were killed in the crossfire between our fighters
*  and Israeli security services and the military.
*  And there's ample evidence that show that that's just not true.
*  There is evidence and testimony from Israeli survivors of the attacks.
*  There is dash cam footage from cars that were parked in places where the attacks took place.
*  There's surveillance footage from cameras that were posted in the communities.
*  And there's even helmet cameras that some of the Hamas fighters were wearing that were
*  captured by the Israelis after the fighters were killed.
*  And so we have that footage as well.
*  So all of this shows that regardless of what Hamas says, the objectives of the attack were
*  that many of these fighters just moved deliberately through these communities in a very studied
*  way, shooting and killing people on site.
*  My colleagues have done work proving that they cornered civilians who had taken shelter
*  inside of bomb shelters and threw grenades inside to try to kill them while they were
*  stuck in there.
*  And there's other evidence that they just lit people's houses on fire on top of them.
*  So we know that Hamas's denials are just not true.
*  And when you ask them about, okay, well, there's a big war going on.
*  Obviously, we see the death toll in Gaza going up every day.
*  These are supposed to be your people.
*  They basically say, whatever Israel does is not our fault.
*  We're out here trying to save the Palestinian cause.
*  And if Israel decides to come back and kill a bunch of people in Gaza, that's not our
*  problem.
*  So when you take a step back and look at what they're saying in the context of this broader
*  goal, they just seem to be saying that all of these deaths are just the necessary cost
*  of this blowing up of the status quo.
*  Ben, bottom line, to accomplish this objective of upending the status quo for Hamas, for
*  its leaders, it seems like almost any amount of death would be allowable.
*  Right.
*  In my conversations with some of the Hamas leaders, there really did not seem to be a
*  lot of hand-wringing about the number of civilian deaths that have come about because of this
*  attack.
*  So help us better understand how that status quo that Hamas is so desperate to shatter
*  came to be and how Hamas decided that it was willing to go to this length to destroy it.
*  So I found it very useful in trying to understand how Hamas got to this point, looking at the
*  career of one of the people who ended up plotting this attack.
*  This is the head of Hamas in Gaza, whose name is Yahya Sinwar.
*  So what should we know about him?
*  Yahya Sinwar is from the first generation of Hamas.
*  Hamas was a Palestinian militant movement founded in the late 80s that was an Islamist
*  movement that aimed to destroy Israel with military means and replace it with a Palestinian
*  state.
*  At this time, the Israeli military was occupying the West Bank and Gaza, and Hamas was not
*  interested in just ending the occupation of these territories.
*  Hamas believed that the entire state of Israel was an occupation.
*  This sets it apart from other Palestinian movements that have negotiated with Israel
*  and accept Israel's right to exist.
*  Hamas never accepted that and felt that the whole thing was wrong and that the only solution
*  was to completely destroy Israel and replace it with a Palestinian state.
*  So Sinwar is from the very early generation of this movement, and from very early on,
*  he's sort of an internal security guy.
*  He's in charge of looking out for Israeli moles inside of the organization, and he punishes
*  these people with such brutality that he's given the nickname the Butcher of Hanunis.
*  Hanunis is a town in Gaza where he was born, and so he was known as the Butcher of Hanunis.
*  So he's an enforcer within Hamas, a violent figure within an already violent group.
*  Yes.
*  Then in 1988, he gets arrested by the Israelis, and he is thrown in jail for the murder of
*  four Palestinians who were alleged collaborators with Israel, spying inside of the organization.
*  And he's in prison for 22 years, and he describes Slater as being very educational.
*  He learns to speak good Hebrew.
*  He reads books in Hebrew, and he describes it as being this great opportunity to really
*  get to know his enemy, to understand Israeli society, to understand how Israel works and
*  how it thinks.
*  And clearly, this is because he does expect or hope that someday he's going to get out
*  of prison and that this knowledge is going to come in useful.
*  He's studying Israel from inside prison so that he might someday better understand, it
*  sounds like, their weaknesses.
*  Right.
*  So while he's in jail, Hamas expands as a movement, and it becomes basically notorious
*  for using very, very violent techniques to try to harm Israel.
*  In 2007, it gets in a huge fight with other Palestinian factions inside of Gaza and ends
*  up taking the place over and basically exiling the Palestinian Authority.
*  And this puts the movement in a really new place.
*  I mean, this was a movement that was founded to do military action against Israel.
*  And suddenly, it finds itself governing a territory.
*  I mean, it becomes the de facto government of a territory that now has more than 2 million
*  Palestinians.
*  And so instead of just wanting to launch attacks and figure out ways to attack the Israeli
*  military, suddenly they have to think about infrastructure and how to provide services
*  for all these people who are technically under their rule.
*  But of course, Sinwar is in prison and cannot be a part of this transformation of Hamas
*  into the governing authority of Gaza.
*  Yes.
*  So while all this is happening on the outside, Sinwar is inside, learning Hebrew and getting
*  to know Israel better.
*  And then all of a sudden, he gets an opportunity and basically Hamas gets an opportunity.
*  On Sunday, Palestinian fighters used a tunnel to attack a border post and kidnap an Israeli
*  soldier.
*  In 2006, some Hamas fighters pop up from a tunnel on the Israeli side of the border separating
*  Israel from Gaza and they take a soldier captive and they drag him back to Gaza and
*  they hold him.
*  The 8,500 Palestinians held captive in Israel now in the spotlight following the militants
*  capture of the Israeli soldier.
*  Their freedom, the single demand so far from the corporals captures.
*  And there are years of negotiations.
*  And then in 2011, there's an agreement for a prisoner swap.
*  And in the end, Hamas trades this one Israeli soldier named Galad Sharit and they get in
*  return more than a thousand Palestinians released from prison.
*  It was just before midday that the first coach load of Palestinian prisoners came across
*  the Egyptian border into Rafah.
*  And among them is Yahya Sinwar.
*  Yahya Sinwar is the only one of the group's top leaders to be freed in the deal.
*  And Sinwar is one of the biggest prizes that Hamas gets out.
*  And then he returns to Gaza and he receives a hero's welcome.
*  And he does this not just with this new Israel education that he's gotten while he was locked
*  up, but he also of course learns lesson, which is that Israel will pay dearly to get its
*  captives released.
*  Right, one thousand Palestinian prisoners, including himself, for a single Israeli soldier.
*  Right.
*  And so here, you know, returns this leader with 22 years in Israeli prison and he comes
*  back and reintegrates into Hamas and begins his further climb up the ranks.
*  The Palestinian group Hamas has elected a commander of its armed wing as overall leader
*  in Gaza.
*  And in 2017, he actually becomes the top Hamas official in Gaza.
*  And in that role, he starts to transform that branch of the organization.
*  He does things to make the organization stronger.
*  And interestingly, he sends certain messages implying that he's actually interested in
*  a kind of accommodation with Israel.
*  Huh, explain that.
*  Well, so by this point, Hamas and Israel have settled into this strange kind of violent
*  coexistence.
*  They're obviously incredibly hostile parties.
*  Violence frequently breaks out.
*  In fact, entire wars break out.
*  But there's also a lot of interaction because Israel controls almost all of Gaza's borders,
*  except, you know, a small part controlled by Egypt.
*  Most of Gaza's electricity comes from Israel.
*  Most of Gaza's commercial goods are brought in from Israel.
*  And so just for the place to survive, there needs to be a certain amount of interaction.
*  And so this strange process develops where violence frequently breaks out and Hamas will
*  fire rockets into Israel and try to hit Israeli towns and military bases.
*  And then Israel responds with airstrikes and sometimes with assassinations of Hamas leaders
*  inside of Gaza.
*  And then mediators get involved and while they're trying to work out a ceasefire, there's
*  a negotiation that's not really about the larger conflict, but sort of about some of
*  the details of the actual blockade.
*  And, you know, Hamas is trying to find ways to loosen up this blockade to allow more goods
*  to enter Gaza.
*  And over time, Sinwar ends up giving people in the Israeli security establishment this
*  impression that that's actually something that's important to him, that he actually
*  does want to try to make life better for the people of Gaza.
*  And it's not just all military all the time.
*  And then in 2021, there's another war between Israel and Hamas.
*  And after that, there's a negotiation.
*  And again, Hamas pushes for a number of things that seem to be geared towards improving life
*  for Gazans.
*  They negotiate tens of millions of dollars in aid from Qatar to come in through Israel
*  to Gaza to keep the economy functioning in the place.
*  They negotiate work permits to try to increase the number of work permits for Gazans to leave
*  Gaza into Israel to work, because there's really not a lot of jobs in Gaza.
*  And so this is a good thing for the economy.
*  And so, you know, at another point, even more recently than that, there were clashes started
*  by other militant factions in Gaza, and Hamas sits out.
*  They sit on the side.
*  And so together, this creates this impression on the Israeli side that I think there's sort
*  of two prongs to it.
*  One is that the Israeli defense technology is enough to keep Gaza contained.
*  We have this border fence that has cameras and it has motion sensors and it has remote
*  control machine guns.
*  We have an underground wall, so there's no tunnels.
*  And we have Iron Dome, which is the Israeli rocket interception system.
*  And then on top of that, they say, well, we also have this leader in Gaza who seems like
*  he doesn't want to get a bunch of his people killed in yet another war.
*  It sounds like you're saying Sinwar's conduct and his messaging is contributing to this
*  feeling inside Israel that maybe Gaza and Hamas can be contained.
*  This can all be managed.
*  Right.
*  And it's not that anybody thinks that they've managed to sort of solve the long term conflict
*  with Hamas.
*  It's more that, okay, well, we've got this situation under control.
*  That with our security measures to try to keep them contained and that if we can keep
*  enough aid going in to keep the economy going along so that people aren't too miserable,
*  that in a way this could keep things from really blowing up.
*  But, meanwhile, it's clear to us in hindsight that Sinwar was not at all happy with that
*  status quo and that he was covertly working to try to build up Hamas's military capabilities
*  inside of Gaza.
*  Well, how so?
*  Well, Hamas continues to build its arsenal of rockets inside of Gaza.
*  They smuggle in the materials that they need to make them and they build them inside of
*  Gaza.
*  So they're building up this arsenal.
*  And on a more strategic level, Sinwar comes in and he repairs the relationship between
*  Hamas and specifically with the Hamas military wing in Gaza and some of its older regional
*  allies.
*  The most important of these is Iran, which had been a funder and the state supporter
*  of Hamas since the early days of the movement, and also with Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia,
*  which is also dedicated to the destruction of Israel and works closely with Iran to try
*  to build this sort of network of regional militias that are out to harm Israel.
*  We know that in recent years, a number of Hamas fighters have been able to get out of
*  Gaza and travel both to Iran and to Lebanon for various kinds of training.
*  And looking back at this attack, we realized they were probably learning new capabilities
*  that really added a whole different kind of sophistication to the kinds of attacks that
*  Hamas was able to carry out.
*  So all these alliances you're describing that Sinwar deepens, they're in the service of
*  making Hamas a stronger, more capable fighting force.
*  Yes.
*  I mean, he clearly knows that the battle is not over.
*  And it certainly is clear in hindsight that his end goal was not to govern Gaza and to
*  try to improve the life of Gazans.
*  But he was very interested in developing the military capabilities so that he could find
*  a way to hit Israel in a new and powerful way.
*  So what exactly sets the stage for doing just that, hitting Israel in a new and powerful
*  way and for doing it when Sinwar and Hamas decide to do it on October 7th, 2023?
*  So when I asked the Hamas leaders about this, this is where they brought up the idea that
*  the Palestinian cause was slipping away.
*  And they point to a number of things.
*  And these are issues that are not just important to Hamas.
*  These are issues that are important to all Palestinians.
*  They talk about the most right-wing government in Israeli history coming to power and basically
*  not being at all interested in talking about any future for the Palestinians.
*  They talk about attacks by settlers in the West Bank on Palestinian communities.
*  They talk about police raids on the Al Aqsa Mosque, which is one of the holiest sites
*  in Islam, which is in Jerusalem and has always been sort of a touchstone for the Palestinian
*  claim to the city.
*  There's also, of course, the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which it has enforced since 2007
*  along with Egypt.
*  And also sort of hanging over this is these normalization deals that are happening between
*  Israel and other Arab countries.
*  And this idea that Israel can go around the Palestinians and find peace with the Arabs
*  without resolving the conflict.
*  And these are the things that they're talking about when they're saying, you know, we just
*  felt like the cause was slipping away.
*  Right.
*  Because in a sense, the cause has been slipping away, right?
*  Kind of indisputably.
*  Arab countries who would be natural allies of the Palestinian cause are signing deals
*  in which the only previous obstacle had been the fate of the Palestinian people.
*  And so in signing those deals, they're basically saying they no longer cared about the Palestinian
*  cause.
*  And as you just mentioned, there are these kind of daily insults and offenses occurring
*  that are, if you're a Palestinian, extremely upsetting.
*  Right.
*  And so Hamas basically sees all of this happening and feels like this cause is slipping away.
*  And this is where they get this idea that we have to do something and we have to do
*  something big.
*  We cannot let this issue disappear.
*  We have to bring it back to the world's attention.
*  And that's what gets us to October 7th.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Ben, what have you learned through this reporting you have been doing about how under Sinwar,
*  Hamas planned and thought about the scope of what became the October 7th attack?
*  So we know that they basically felt that the old model was not going to be good enough.
*  This idea that they would fire rockets and try to hit Israeli communities and whatever.
*  No, no, no.
*  This had to be much, much bigger.
*  And so they wanted to take the fight to the Israelis.
*  They wanted to get out of Gaza and not just a few of them, but large numbers of them.
*  And they wanted it to be an incredibly dramatic attack.
*  So they went by air, they went by land, they went by sea, they went inside of Israeli military
*  bases, they went inside Israeli communities and killed a lot of people and took a lot
*  of prisoners and they managed to bring a lot of these hostages back to Gaza.
*  And Sinwar knows better than anybody how much the taking of one Israeli captive can change
*  the situation.
*  And we know that when they launched this attack, they were seeking captives.
*  They wanted to find people and bring them back to Gaza.
*  And we also know that this attack was much, much more successful than even its plotters
*  had anticipated.
*  And so now the fact that Hamas, instead of just one Israeli captive, has somewhere around
*  240, it just pushes the entire conflict into this uncharted territory where nobody really
*  knows what comes next.
*  Well, let's talk more about the aftermath of this brutal attack and how, Ben, in your
*  reporting you've been trying to understand whether Hamas did what it set out to do, given
*  the original aims, as you have described and reported them, of exploding a status quo.
*  I mean, how should we think about measuring this idea, this complicated idea, that this
*  was, to use Hamas's word, a success?
*  Well, I think in the fundamental sense of setting out to shatter the status quo, then,
*  yeah, this accomplished that.
*  Gaza's never going to go back to what it was.
*  I think in terms of the goal of putting the Palestinian cause back on the table, I think
*  it was true that not many people were paying attention to it just over a month ago.
*  And now, because of Israel's ferocious response to the Hamas attacks and the bombing of Gaza,
*  now we're seeing protests coming out all over the world in different cities in the U.S.
*  talking about Palestinian rights in a way that we have not seen before.
*  And there's also this sort of frantic diplomacy that started, and you have U.S. Secretary
*  of State, Anthony Blinken, flying around and talking about the two-state solution and how
*  to make progress on it.
*  And so the issue is on the table in a way that it was not before this attack.
*  And then in terms of this idea of sparking this big regional war, that has not happened,
*  at least not to the extent that Hamas had hoped.
*  There has been fighting on the Lebanese border with Hezbollah.
*  There have been attacks in Iraq, but we have not seen this sort of huge uprising and the
*  rest of the Arabs kind of joining the cause to come and try to help Hamas destroy Israel.
*  Then that feels important to dwell on for just a moment.
*  If Hamas' militant allies in the Middle East, Hezbollah, for example, don't become more
*  involved in this conflict, will that be a signal that the Palestinian cause is not likely
*  to stay top of mind for very long?
*  And then ultimately, one of the main objectives of October 7th will have failed.
*  I mean, one of the most surprising things, I think, for me about all of this is that
*  Iran and its regional militias, including Hamas, have been talking for a long time about
*  how they had built this axis of resistance and how they were much more integrated and
*  they were sharing technology and sharing information.
*  And there's this idea that they had put out that if there was a war against Israel, all
*  the pieces would fall into place and it would be like this big sort of militant Voltron
*  that would come together and fight Israel.
*  And that's not what happened.
*  I was quite surprised in the reporting that we don't have any indications that Hamas coordinated
*  this attack with anybody or that they let anybody know that it was coming.
*  Hezbollah's response was quite cautious at the very beginning.
*  They're now clashing with Israel on the border, but they've done it in sort of a controlled
*  way to keep it from escalating into a bigger war.
*  And so it sort of raises this whole question of this idea of this big regional militia
*  network.
*  Well, maybe it's not as coordinated as we thought.
*  I mean, if Hamas is actually going to be the one to pull the plug on this big war and these
*  other guys don't actually want to join it in the same way that Hamas is doing it, then
*  maybe this network is not as tight as we expected it was.
*  So yes, Hamas has put the question of the Palestinians back on people's minds, whether
*  it's demonstrators or like Blinken diplomats.
*  But to what end?
*  I mean, ideally, from the point of view of Hamas, the end is a Palestinian state and
*  the elimination of Israel.
*  It seems like Hamas is no closer to that now than they were before October 7th.
*  So in Hamas's mind, what is supposed to be on the other side of the status quo that's
*  gone other than Israeli death and Israeli suffering and Palestinian death and Palestinian
*  suffering on an enormous scale?
*  In my talks with the Hamas leaders, there was really no sense of a grand plan for what
*  comes next.
*  They definitely wanted to hit Israel as hard as they could, and they wanted to hit Israel
*  inside of Israel.
*  And they were not particularly concerned about what sort of response this would bring and
*  what it would mean to the people of Gaza.
*  It was that the attack somehow would be enough and would open up some new way.
*  Now that we're five weeks into this, I think it's also worth pointing out that Israel doesn't
*  appear to have a grand plan either.
*  The stated goal is to destroy Hamas, and Israel can probably make a lot of progress on that.
*  They could kill a lot of the Hamas leaders.
*  They can degrade its military capabilities.
*  But then what?
*  There's not really any plan for who's going to run Gaza once this is all over.
*  And so where does all this get us?
*  I mean, I think it's difficult to tell the future, but there's a few possibilities.
*  One is that the violence gets so bad and the destruction gets so great that people get
*  sort of disgusted with it and decide that there has to be some new way forward.
*  There has to be a new way to try to figure out how to keep this cycle from continuing.
*  But it's also sadly possible that Israel will go in and do whatever it feels that it needs
*  to do in Gaza.
*  And the world could move on, and people could go back to forgetting about the Palestinians.
*  And we could end up in a kind of status quo like we had before, but one that's even worse
*  for the people of Gaza.
*  And Israel has been trying to destroy Hamas for a long time.
*  And this time they may make a lot of progress.
*  They may kill a lot of their leaders and they may degrade their military capabilities.
*  But there's still going to be two million Palestinians living in Gaza, and most of them
*  are children.
*  And after all the trauma of living through a war like this, it's just very hard to imagine
*  that they're going to grow up and feel like they want to live peacefully next door with
*  Israel.
*  And it's certainly not hard to imagine that some other organization could come up and
*  that it's not going to have a hard time finding recruits.
*  Right, what you're describing is a potential new status quo, replacing this shattered status
*  quo that is worse for the people in Gaza and, in theory, potentially worse for Israel.
*  Yes, I think that's the worst case scenario for how this could all end.
*  Well, thank you Ben, we appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  The temporary funding plan that so far is drawing support from Democrats and opposition
*  from Johnson's fellow far-right Republicans.
*  That raises the possibility that Johnson's first major piece of legislation, a continuing
*  resolution known as a CR, will only win passage with the support of House Democrats, a reality
*  that doomed Johnson's predecessor, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
*  For now, I am pleased that Speaker Johnson seems to be moving in our direction.
*  In a speech from the Senate floor on Monday, the chamber's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer,
*  praised Johnson's plan.
*  I've said on multiple occasions that if we're going to work together to keep the government
*  open, Speaker Johnson will have to avoid pushing steep cuts or poison pills that Democrats
*  can't support.
*  And after a series of embarrassing revelations about undisclosed gifts and real estate deals
*  by the justices, the U.S. Supreme Court has for the first time adopted a formal code of
*  ethics that requires greater transparency to the public.
*  Unlike lower court judges, the justices of the Supreme Court have never been bound to
*  a code of conduct given their special status in the U.S. Constitution.
*  But so far, it's unclear how the ethics code will actually be enforced.
*  Today's episode was produced by Mary Wilson, Asli Chaturvedi, and Rob Zipko.
