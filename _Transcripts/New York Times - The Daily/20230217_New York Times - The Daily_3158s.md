Video Description: Menopausal hormone therapy was once the most commonly prescribed treatment in the United States. In the late 1990s, some 15 million women a year were receiving a prescription for it. But in 2002, a single study, its design imperfect, found links between hormone therapy and elevated health risks for women of all ages. Panic set in; in one year, the number of prescriptions plummeted.


Hormone therapy carries risks, to be sure, as do many medications that people take to relieve serious discomfort, but dozens of studies since 2002 have provided reassurance that for healthy women under 60 whose hot flashes are troubling them, the benefits of taking hormones outweigh the risks. The treatment’s reputation, however, has never fully recovered, and the consequences have been wide-reaching.


About 85 percent of women experience menopausal symptoms. Rebecca Thurston, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who studies menopause, believes that, in general, menopausal women have been underserved — an oversight that she considers one of the great blind spots of medicine.


“It suggests that we have a high cultural tolerance for women’s suffering,” Thurston said. “It’s not regarded as important.”

# The Sunday Read: ‘Women Have Been Misled About Menopause’
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro)
*  My name is Susan Dominus, and I'm a staff writer for the New York Times magazine. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=0.0s)]
*  When I turned 51, I took a trip with a bunch of my closest women friends. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=15.4s)]
*  We talked about all kinds of things, but I would say of the seven days we were away, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=20.22s)]
*  at least half of one of those days was spent discussing one topic, menopause. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=25.76s)]
*  All of us were unbelievably baffled by what exactly was happening. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=33.08s)]
*  The night sweats, the hot flashes to start, and if and how we were supposed to treat it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=37.6s)]
*  There was perimenopause, the run-up to menopause. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  That was different. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=47.52s)]
*  Could you get any kind of treatment for that? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=48.52s)]
*  Were there supplements that worked? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=51.24s)]
*  Could we be meditating or something? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=53.26s)]
*  The information we were seeing online was extremely confusing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  It was hard to figure out what the best sources of information were, and I found that shocking. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=59.739999999999995s)]
*  This is an inevitable thing that is coming for every healthy woman as she hits 50 or [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=66.25999999999999s)]
*  so. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=71.3s)]
*  How was it that we don't have as much information about menopause as we do about going through [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=72.3s)]
*  puberty? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  I thought, if we're confused about this, probably a lot of other women are as well. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=78.16000000000001s)]
*  It turned out there was this hardly obscure treatment, menopausal hormone therapy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=84.28s)]
*  MHT, as it's sometimes known, has risks considered to be low for women under 60, but [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=90.08s)]
*  can drastically improve symptoms. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  But it's very misunderstood. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=98.92s)]
*  For this Sunday read, I'm sharing an article I wrote about trying to understand menopausal [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=101.62s)]
*  hormone therapy, the real risks and benefits, and why it has been given such a bad rap [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=106.44s)]
*  over the years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=111.72s)]
*  While I was writing and researching this story, I became somebody who brought up menopause [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=114.24s)]
*  at every dinner or cocktail party I went to, probably inappropriately. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=117.56s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=122.44s)]
*  But whenever I told women about what I was working on, they'd stop, look at me and say, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=123.44s)]
*  Finally, or thank you, or what have you found out? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=130.72s)]
*  So here's my story from the February 5th, 2023 issue of the New York Times Magazine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=136.8s)]
*  Women have been misled about menopause. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=142.6s)]
*  For the past two or three years, many of my friends, women mostly in their early 50s, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=147.8s)]
*  have found themselves in an unexpected state of suffering. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=153.04s)]
*  The cause of their suffering was something they had in common, but that did not make [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=156.94s)]
*  it easier for them to figure out what to do about it, even though they knew it was [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=160.3s)]
*  coming. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=163.86s)]
*  It was menopause. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=164.86s)]
*  The symptoms they experienced were varied and intrusive. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=168.24s)]
*  Some lost hours of sleep every night, disruptions that chipped away at their mood, their energy, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=171.8s)]
*  the vast resources of goodwill that it takes to parent and to partner. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=177.74s)]
*  One friend endured week-long stretches of menstrual bleeding so heavy that she had to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=182.66000000000003s)]
*  miss work. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=187.10000000000002s)]
*  Another friend was plagued by as many as 10 hot flashes a day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=188.72s)]
*  A third was so troubled by her flights of anger, their intensity new to her, that she [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=191.84s)]
*  sat her 12-year-old son down to explain that she was not feeling right, that there was [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=196.44s)]
*  this thing called menopause and that she was going through it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=201.04s)]
*  Another felt a pervasive dryness in her skin, her nails, her throat, even her eyes, as if [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=205.44s)]
*  she were slowly calcifying. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=210.6s)]
*  And last year, I reached the same state of transition. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=215.72s)]
*  Technically, it is known as perimenopause, the biologically chaotic phase leading up [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=218.24s)]
*  to a woman's last period, when her reproductive cycle makes its final faltering runs. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=224.56s)]
*  The shift, which lasts on average four years, typically starts when women reach their late [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=230.84s)]
*  40s, the point at which the egg-producing sacs of the ovaries start to plummet in number. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=235.96s)]
*  In response, some hormones, among them estrogen and progesterone, spike and dip erratically, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=241.82s)]
*  their usual signaling systems failing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=246.98s)]
*  During this time, a woman's period may be much heavier or lighter than usual. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=250.76s)]
*  As levels of estrogen, a crucial chemical messenger, trend downward, women are at higher [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=255.44s)]
*  risk for severe depressive symptoms. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=260.12s)]
*  Bone loss accelerates. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=262.94s)]
*  In women who have a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, the first plaques are thought to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  in the brain during this period. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=269.38s)]
*  Women often gain weight quickly or see it shift to their middles as the body fights [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=272.26s)]
*  to hold onto the estrogen that abdominal fat cells produce. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=276.4s)]
*  The body is in a temporary state of adjustment, even reinvention, like a machine that once [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=281.0s)]
*  ran on gas, trying to adjust to solar power, challenged to find workarounds. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=286.38s)]
*  I knew I was in perimenopause because my period disappeared for months at a time, only to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=291.42s)]
*  return with no explanation. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=297.7s)]
*  In the weeks leading up to each period, I experienced abdominal discomfort so extreme [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  that I went for an ultrasound to make sure I didn't have some ever-growing cyst. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=306.76s)]
*  At times, hot flashes woke me at night, forcing me straight into the kinds of anxious thoughts [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=312.14s)]
*  that take on ferocious life in the early hours of morning. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=317.28s)]
*  Even more distressing was the hard turn my memory took for the worse. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=321.8s)]
*  I was forever blanking on something I said as soon as I'd said it, chronically groping [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=325.85999999999996s)]
*  for words or names, a development apparent enough that people close to me commented on it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=330.78s)]
*  I was haunted by a conversation I had with a writer I admired, someone who quit relatively young. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=337.5s)]
*  At a small party, I asked her why. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=343.94s)]
*  Menopause, she told me without hesitation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=346.73999999999995s)]
*  I couldn't think of the words. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=349.78s)]
*  My friend's reports of their recent doctor's visits suggested that there was no obvious [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=355.84s)]
*  recourse for these symptoms. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  When one friend mentioned that she was waking once nightly because of hot flashes, her gynecologist [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=365.61999999999995s)]
*  waved it off as hardly worth discussing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  A colleague of mine seeking relief from hot flashes was prescribed bee pollen extract, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=374.02s)]
*  which she dutifully took with no result. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=379.21999999999997s)]
*  Another friend who expressed concerns about a lower libido and vaginal dryness could tell [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=382.56s)]
*  that her gynecologist was uncomfortable talking about both. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=387.3s)]
*  I thought, hey, aren't you a vagina doctor, she told me. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=390.34s)]
*  I use that thing for sex. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=394.62s)]
*  Their doctor's responses prompted me to contemplate a thought experiment, one that is not exactly [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=397.48s)]
*  original but is nevertheless striking. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=402.04s)]
*  Imagine that some significant portion of the male population started regularly waking in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=405.66s)]
*  the middle of the night, drenched in sweat, a problem that endured for several years. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=410.14s)]
*  Imagine that those men stumbled to work exhausted, their morale low, frequently tearing off their [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=416.12s)]
*  jackets or hoodies during meetings and excusing themselves to gulp for air by a window. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=420.84s)]
*  Imagine that many of them suddenly found sex to be painful, that they were newly prone [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=427.21999999999997s)]
*  to urinary tract infections, with their penises becoming dry and irritable, even showing signs [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  of what their doctors called atrophy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=437.28s)]
*  Imagine that many of their doctors had received little to no training on how to manage these [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=440.46s)]
*  symptoms and when the subject arose, sometimes reassured their patients that this process [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=443.94s)]
*  was natural, as if that should be consolation enough. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=449.05999999999995s)]
*  Now imagine that there was a treatment for all these symptoms that doctors often overlooked. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=453.71999999999997s)]
*  The scenario seems unlikely, and yet it's a depressingly accurate picture of menopausal [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  care for women. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=464.78s)]
*  There is a treatment, hardly obscure, known as menopausal hormone therapy, that eases [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=466.78s)]
*  hot flashes and sleep disruption and possibly depression and aching joints. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=472.17999999999995s)]
*  It decreases the risk of diabetes and protects against osteoporosis. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=477.44s)]
*  It also helps prevent and treat menopausal genitourinary syndrome, a collection of symptoms, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=482.7s)]
*  including urinary tract infections and pain during sex, that affects nearly half of post-menopausal [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=489.23999999999995s)]
*  Menopausal hormone therapy was once the most commonly prescribed treatment in the United [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=495.94s)]
*  States. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=501.40000000000003s)]
*  In the late 1990s, some 15 million women a year were receiving a prescription for it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=503.22s)]
*  But in 2002, a single study, its design imperfect, found links between hormone therapy and elevated [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=508.84000000000003s)]
*  health risks for women of all ages. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=517.28s)]
*  Panic set in. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=520.64s)]
*  In one year, the number of prescriptions plummeted. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=522.36s)]
*  Hormone therapy carries risks, to be sure, as do many medications that people take to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=525.76s)]
*  relieve serious discomfort. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=530.76s)]
*  But dozens of studies since 2002 have provided reassurance that for healthy women under 60, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=533.24s)]
*  whose hot flashes are troubling them, the benefits of taking hormones outweigh the risks. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=539.92s)]
*  The treatment's reputation, however, has never fully recovered, and the consequences [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=545.72s)]
*  have been wide-reaching. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  It is painful to contemplate the sheer number of indignities unnecessarily endured over [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=551.3199999999999s)]

*  by 29 percent. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1040.5s)]
*  The risk of strokes increased by 41 percent. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1042.26s)]

*  The increase in the risk of breast cancer, for example, could also be presented this way. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1063.02s)]
*  A woman's risk of having breast cancer between the ages of 50 and 60 is around 2.33 percent. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1068.06s)]

*  Smoking by contrast increases cancer risk by 2,600 percent. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1084.3s)]

*  But what is risk? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1115.98s)]

*  That choice meant that women in their 50s, who tended to be healthier and have more menopausal [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1152.18s)]

*  I remember where I was when John Kennedy was shot, Minkin says. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1203.06s)]
*  I remember where I was on 9-11. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1206.5s)]

*  Within six months, insurance claims for hormone therapy had dropped by 30 percent, and by [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1231.02s)]

*  the most dramatic sea change in clinical medicine that I have ever seen. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1250.66s)]
*  Newsweek characterized the response as near panic. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1255.8200000000002s)]
*  The message that took hold then and has persisted ever since was a warped understanding of the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1259.54s)]
*  research that became a cudgel of a warning. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1265.94s)]
*  Hormone therapy is dangerous for women. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1270.02s)]
*  The full picture of hormone therapy is now known to be far more nuanced and reassuring. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1273.06s)]
*  When patients tell Stephanie Fabian, the director of the Mayo Clinic Center for Women's Health, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1295.54s)]
*  that they've heard that hormones are dangerous, she has a fairly consistent response. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1300.48s)]
*  I sigh, Fabian told me. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1305.56s)]

*  an association of menopause specialists, says the first question patients usually ask her [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1317.76s)]
*  is about breast cancer risk. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1323.72s)]
*  She explains that in the WHI trial, women who were given a combination of estrogen and [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1326.18s)]
*  progestin saw an increased risk emerge only after five years on hormones. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1331.0600000000002s)]
*  And even after 20 years, the mortality rate of women who took those hormones was no higher [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1337.1000000000001s)]
*  than that of the control group. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1342.46s)]
*  Some researchers have hoped that new formulations of hormone therapy will lessen the risk of [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1344.54s)]
*  breast cancer. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1348.8400000000001s)]
*  One major observational study published last year suggested so, but that research is not [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1350.5800000000002s)]
*  conclusive. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1354.82s)]
*  The biggest takeaway from the last two decades of research is that age matters. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1356.8999999999999s)]
*  For women who go through early menopause, before age 45, hormone therapy is recommended [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1361.74s)]
*  because they're at greater risk for osteoporosis if they don't receive hormones up until the [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1367.3799999999999s)]
*  typical age of menopause. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1372.22s)]
*  For healthy women in their 50s, life-threatening events like clots or strokes are rare, and [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1374.9399999999998s)]
*  so the increased risks from hormone therapy are also quite low. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1381.6599999999999s)]
*  When Manson, along with Rousseau, did a reanalysis of the WHI findings, she found that women [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1387.1s)]
*  under 60 in the trial had no elevated risk of heart disease. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1392.6999999999998s)]
*  The findings, however, did reveal greater risks for women who start hormone therapy [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1398.02s)]
*  after age 60. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1402.1799999999998s)]
*  Manson's analyses found that women had a small elevated risk of coronary heart disease if [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1404.74s)]
*  they started taking hormones after age 60, and a significant elevated risk if they started [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1408.82s)]
*  after age 70. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1415.02s)]
*  It was possible researchers have hypothesized that hormones may be most effective within [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1417.1399999999999s)]
*  a certain window, perpetuating the well-being of systems that are still healthy, but accelerating [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1421.98s)]
*  damage in those that are already in decline. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1427.82s)]
*  No definitive research has yet followed women who start in their 50s and stay on continuously [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1431.58s)]
*  into their 60s. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1436.66s)]
*  Researchers also now have a better appreciation of the benefits of hormone therapy. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1439.34s)]
*  Even at the time that the WHI findings were released, the data showed at least one clear [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1443.78s)]
*  improvement resulting from hormone therapy. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1448.5s)]
*  Women had 24% fewer fractures. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1451.54s)]
*  Since then, other positive results have emerged. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1455.06s)]
*  The incidence of diabetes, for instance, was found to be 20% lower in women who took hormones [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1457.82s)]
*  compared with those who took a placebo. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1463.38s)]
*  In the WHI trial, women who had hysterectomies, 30% of American women by age 60, were given [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1466.18s)]
*  estrogen alone because they did not need progesterone to protect them from endometrial cancer. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1472.66s)]
*  And that group had lower rates of breast cancer than the placebo group. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1479.22s)]
*  Nonetheless, Blooming and his co-author Carol Tavris write in Estrogen Matters, we have [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1483.3s)]
*  yet to see an NIH press conference convened to reassure women of the benefits of estrogen. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1488.18s)]
*  Anything short of that, they argue, allows misrepresentations and fears to persist. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1494.3s)]
*  Positive reports about hormone therapy for women in their 50s started emerging as early [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1500.06s)]
*  as 2003, and they've never really slowed. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1504.2s)]
*  But the revelations have come in a trickle, with no one story gaining a kind of exposure [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1508.06s)]
*  or momentum of the WHI news conference. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1512.74s)]
*  In 2016, Manson tried to rectify the problem in an article for the New England Journal [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1516.46s)]
*  of Medicine, issuing a clear course correction of the WHI findings as they pertain to women [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1521.46s)]
*  in their 40s and 50s. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1526.8600000000001s)]
*  Since she published that paper, she feels attitudes have changed, but too slowly. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1529.42s)]
*  Manson frequently speaks to the press, and as the years passed and more data accumulated [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1535.02s)]
*  that suggested that the risks were not as alarming as they were first presented, you [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1539.82s)]
*  can almost track her increasing frustration in her public comments. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1544.7s)]
*  Women who would be appropriate candidates are being denied hormone therapy for the treatment [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1549.74s)]
*  of their symptoms, she told me in a recent interview. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1553.7s)]
*  She was dismayed that some doctors were not offering relief to women in their 50s on the [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1557.34s)]
*  basis of a study whose average subject age was 63 and in which the risk assessments were [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1561.74s)]
*  largely driven by women in their 70s. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1568.06s)]
*  We're talking about literally tens of thousands of clinicians who are reluctant to prescribe hormones. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1571.38s)]
*  Even with new information, doctors still find themselves in a difficult position. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1577.8999999999999s)]
*  If they rely on the WHI, they have the benefit of a gold standard trial, but one that focused [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1583.02s)]
*  on mostly older women and relied on higher doses and different formulations of hormones [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1589.78s)]
*  from those most often prescribed today. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1594.8999999999999s)]
*  New formulations more closely mimic the natural hormones in a woman's body. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1598.34s)]
*  There are also new methods of delivery, taking hormones via transdermal patch rather than [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1603.06s)]
*  a pill allows the medication to bypass the liver, which seems to eliminate the risk of [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1607.62s)]
*  clots. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1613.34s)]
*  But the studies supporting the safety of newer options are observational. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1614.34s)]
*  They have not been studied in long-term randomized controlled trials. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1619.6599999999999s)]
*  The NAMS guidelines emphasize that doctors should make hormone therapy recommendations [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1625.3799999999999s)]
*  based on the personal health history and risk factors of each patient. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1630.1s)]
*  Many women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause already have increased baseline [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1634.78s)]

*  diabetes, or high cholesterol. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1645.3400000000001s)]
*  Even so, Fabian says, quote, there are few women who have absolute contraindications, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1649.1000000000001s)]
*  meaning that for them hormones would be off the table. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1655.5s)]
*  At highest risk from hormone use are women who have already had a heart attack, breast [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1658.7s)]
*  cancer, stroke, or blood clot, or women with a cluster of significant health problems. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1664.22s)]
*  For everyone else, Fabian says, the decision has to do with the severity of the symptoms [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1670.54s)]
*  as well as personal preferences and level of risk tolerance. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1675.66s)]
*  For high risk women, other sources of relief exist. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1680.46s)]
*  The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, peroxetine, is approved for the relief of [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1683.7s)]
*  hot flashes, although it is not as effective as hormone therapy. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1688.74s)]
*  Cognitive behavioral therapy has also been shown to help women with how much hot flashes [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1694.26s)]
*  bother them. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1698.3s)]

*  involved in triggering hot flashes. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1709.58s)]
*  Conversations about the risks and benefits of these various treatments often require [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1713.7s)]

*  Personally, medicine generally doesn't want to deal with this because who wants to have [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1745.66s)]
*  a 45-minute long conversation with somebody about the risks and benefits of hormone therapy? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1748.54s)]
*  Because it's nuanced and complicated. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1753.06s)]

*  when they're not even having hot flashes, I say hormone therapy is not a fountain of [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1773.98s)]

*  Medical schools, in response to the WHI, were quick to abandon menopausal education. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1788.3s)]
*  There was no treatment considered safe and effective, so they decided there was nothing [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1794.42s)]

*  About half of all practicing gynecologists are under 50, which means that they started [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1802.3s)]
*  their residencies after the publication of the WHI trial and might never have received [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1806.56s)]
*  meaningful education about menopause. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1811.3799999999999s)]
*  When my younger partners see patients with menopausal symptoms, they refer them to me, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1813.7s)]
*  says Audrey Buxbaum, a 60-year-old gynecologist with a practice in New York. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1819.62s)]
*  Buxbaum, like many doctors over 50, prescribed menopausal hormone therapy before the WHI [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1824.26s)]
*  never stopped. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1831.26s)]
*  Education on a stage of life that affects half the world's population is still wildly [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1833.76s)]
*  overlooked at medical schools. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1837.36s)]
*  A 2017 survey sent to residents across the country found that 20% of them had not heard [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1839.32s)]
*  a single lecture on the subject of menopause, and a third of the respondents said they would [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1845.1s)]
*  not prescribe hormone therapy to a symptomatic woman, even if she had no clear medical conditions [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1849.56s)]
*  that would elevate the risk of doing so. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1854.72s)]
*  I was quizzing my daughter a few years ago when she was studying for the board exams, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1857.0s)]
*  and whoever writes the board questions, the answer is never, give them hormones, Santoro [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1861.96s)]
*  says. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1866.68s)]
*  In recent years, there has been some progress. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1867.8400000000001s)]
*  The University of Pennsylvania has established a menopause clinic, and Johns Hopkins now [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1870.48s)]
*  offers a two-year curriculum on the subject to its medical students. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1874.9s)]
*  But the field of gynecology will most likely, for decades to come, be populated by many [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1879.0s)]
*  doctors who left medical school unprepared to offer guidance to menopausal women who [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1883.48s)]
*  need their help. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1888.1s)]
*  I didn't know all of this when I went to see my gynecologist. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1890.2s)]
*  I knew only what my friends had told me, and that hormone therapy was an option. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1893.44s)]
*  The meeting was only my second with this gynecologist, a woman who struck me as chic, professional, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1898.3600000000001s)]
*  and in a bit of a hurry, which was to be expected, as she's part of a large health care group, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1903.84s)]
*  the kind that makes you think you'd rather die from whatever's ailing you than try to [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1909.1200000000001s)]
*  navigate its phone tree one more time. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1913.0s)]
*  Something about the quick pace of the meeting, the not-so-frequent eye contact, made me hesitate [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1917.08s)]
*  before bringing up my concerns. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1922.24s)]
*  They felt whiny, even inappropriate, but I forged on. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1924.4s)]
*  I was having hot flashes, I told her. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1928.84s)]
*  Not constantly, but enough that it was bothering me. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1931.04s)]
*  I had other concerns, but since memory issues were troubling me the most, I brought that [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1934.04s)]
*  up next. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1937.76s)]
*  That could also just be normal aging, she said. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1938.76s)]
*  She paused and fixed a doubtful gaze in my direction. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1942.24s)]
*  We only prescribe hormones for significant symptoms, she told me. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1945.56s)]
*  I felt rebuffed, startled by how quickly the conversation seemed to have ended, and I was [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1949.52s)]
*  second-guessing myself. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1954.1200000000001s)]
*  Were my symptoms, after all, significant? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1956.0s)]
*  By whose definition? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1958.76s)]
*  The NAMS guidelines suggest that the benefits of hormone therapy outweigh the risks for [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1963.68s)]
*  who have, quote, bothersome hot flashes and no contraindications. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1968.52s)]
*  When I left my doctor's office without a prescription, I spent a lot of time thinking about whether [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1973.92s)]
*  my symptoms were troubling me enough to take on any additional risk, no matter how small. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1978.74s)]
*  On the one hand, I was at a healthy weight and active, at relatively low risk for cardiovascular [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1984.04s)]
*  disease. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1989.36s)]
*  On the other hand, because of family history and other factors, I was at higher risk for [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1991.04s)]
*  breast cancer than many of my same-age peers. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1995.0s)]
*  I felt caught between the promises and, yes, risks of hormone therapy, the remaining gaps [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=1997.44s)]
*  in our knowledge, and my own aversion, common if illogical, to embarking on a new and indefinitely [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2003.6s)]
*  lasting medical regimen. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2009.38s)]
*  Menopause could represent a time when women feel maximum control of our bodies, free at [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2012.56s)]
*  last from the risk of being forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2016.98s)]
*  And yet for many women, menopause becomes a new struggle to control our bodies not because [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2021.6s)]
*  of legislation or religion, but because of a lack of knowledge on our part and also on [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2025.9199999999998s)]
*  the part of our doctors. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2030.56s)]
*  Menopause presents not just a new stage of life, but also a state of confusion. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  At a time when we have the right to feel seasoned, women are thrust into the role of newbie, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2037.6399999999999s)]
*  or worse, medical detective, in charge of solving our own problems. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2042.1999999999998s)]
*  Even the most resourceful women I know, the kind of people you call when you desperately [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2047.64s)]
*  need something done fast and well, describe themselves as baffled by this stage of their [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2051.56s)]
*  lives. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  A recent national poll found that 35% of menopausal women reported that they'd experienced four [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  or more symptoms, but only 44% they had discussed their symptoms with a doctor. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2063.66s)]
*  Women often feel awkward initiating those conversations, and they may not even identify [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2070.04s)]
*  their symptoms as menopausal. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2074.54s)]
*  Menopause has the worst PR campaign in the history of the universe because it's not just [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2077.46s)]
*  hot flashes and night sweats, says Rachel Rubin, a sexual health expert and assistant [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2081.3s)]
*  clinical professor in urology at Georgetown University. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2086.34s)]
*  How many times do I get a 56-year-old woman who comes to me who says, oh yeah, I don't [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2090.34s)]
*  have hot flashes and night sweats, but I have depression and osteoporosis and low libido [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2095.2200000000003s)]
*  and pain with sex? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2100.14s)]
*  These can all be menopausal symptoms. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2101.82s)]
*  In an ideal world, Rubin says, more gynecologists, internists, and urologists would run through [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2105.1000000000004s)]
*  a list of hormonal symptoms with their middle-aged patients rather than waiting to see if those [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2111.38s)]
*  women have the knowledge and wherewithal to bring them up on their own. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2115.7000000000003s)]
*  The WHI trial measured the most severe life-threatening outcomes, breast cancer, heart disease, stroke, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2120.9s)]
*  among others. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2130.22s)]
*  But for a woman who is steadily losing hair, who has joint pain, who suddenly realizes [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2131.8199999999997s)]
*  that her very smell has changed and not for the better, or who is depressed or exhausted, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2137.2599999999998s)]
*  for many of those women, the net benefits of taking hormones and experiencing an improved [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2143.64s)]

*  entails, even after age 60. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2155.22s)]
*  Even for women like me, whose symptoms are not as drastic, but whose risks are low, hormones [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2158.7s)]
*  can make sense. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2164.48s)]
*  I'm not saying every woman needs hormones, Rubin says, but I'm a big believer in your [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2166.46s)]
*  body, your choice. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2171.3399999999997s)]
*  Conversations about menopause lack, among so many other things, the language to help [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2183.2999999999997s)]
*  us make these choices. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2188.02s)]
*  Some women sail blissfully into motherhood, but there's a term for the extreme in anxiety [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2190.06s)]
*  and depression that other women endure following delivery, postpartum depression. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2194.2s)]

*  Others experience mood changes that disrupt their daily functioning, suffering what we [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2203.62s)]
*  call premenstrual syndrome, PMS, or in more serious cases, premenstrual dysphoric disorder. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2207.3s)]
*  A significant portion of women suffer no symptoms whatsoever as they sail into menopause. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2214.74s)]
*  Others suffer near systemic breakdowns with brain fog, recurring hot flashes, and exhaustion. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2222.1s)]
*  Others feel different enough to know they don't like what they feel, but they're hardly [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2229.8599999999997s)]
*  incapacitated. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2233.18s)]
*  Menopause, that baggy term, is too big, too overdetermined, generating a confusion that [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2234.18s)]
*  makes it especially hard to talk about. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2241.7s)]
*  No symptom is more closely associated with menopause than the hot flash, a phenomenon [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2246.2999999999997s)]
*  that's often reduced to a comedic trope. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2252.06s)]

*  they are to the women experiencing them, a reflection of just how much we still have [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2267.02s)]
*  to learn about the biology of menopause. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2271.34s)]
*  Scientists are now trying to figure out whether these hot flashes are merely a symptom or [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2274.94s)]
*  whether they trigger other changes in the body. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2278.94s)]
*  Strangely, the searing heat a woman feels roaring within is not reflected in any significant [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2281.98s)]
*  rise in her core body temperature. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2288.58s)]
*  Hot flashes originate in the hypothalamus, an area of the brain rich in estrogen receptors [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2291.26s)]
*  that is both crucial in the reproductive cycle and also functions as a thermostat. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2296.98s)]
*  Deprived of estrogen, its thermostat now wonky, the hypothalamus is more likely to misread [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2302.9s)]
*  small increases in core body temperature as too hot, triggering a rush of sweat and widespread [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2309.02s)]
*  dilation of the blood vessels in an attempt to cool the body. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2315.5s)]
*  This also drives up the temperature on the skin. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2319.42s)]
*  Some women experience these misfiring once a day, others 10 or more, with each one lasting [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2322.58s)]
*  anywhere from seconds to five minutes. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2327.64s)]
*  On average, women experience them for seven to ten years. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2330.62s)]

*  has been trying to answer. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2345.9s)]
*  Thurston helped lead a study that followed a diverse cohort of 3,000 women over 22 years [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2347.98s)]

*  Their hot flashes started long before their periods became irregular and the women continued [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2358.3s)]
*  to experience them for as many as 14 years, upending the idea that for most women, hot [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2362.86s)]
*  flashes aren't irritating but short-lived in convenience. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2368.14s)]
*  Of the five racial and ethnic groups Thurston studied, Black women were found to experience [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2371.46s)]
*  the most hot flashes, to experience them as the most bothersome, and to endure them [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2376.18s)]
*  the longest. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2381.3799999999997s)]
*  In addition to race, low socioeconomic status was associated with the duration of women's [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2383.0s)]
*  hot flashes, suggesting that the conditions of life, even years later, can affect a body's [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2387.14s)]
*  management of menopause. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2392.5s)]
*  Women who experienced childhood abuse were 70% more likely to report night sweats and [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2394.8599999999997s)]
*  hot flashes. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2399.3199999999997s)]
*  Did those symptoms also signal harm beyond the impact on a woman's quality of life? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2401.74s)]
*  In 2016, Thurston published a study in the journal Stroke showing that women who had [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2407.9399999999996s)]
*  more hot flashes, at least for a day, tended to have more signs of cardiovascular disease. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2412.64s)]
*  The link was even stronger than the association between cardiovascular risk and obesity or [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2420.3799999999997s)]
*  cardiovascular risk and high blood pressure. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2427.18s)]
*  We don't know if it's causal, Thurston cautions, or in which direction. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2430.7s)]
*  We need more research. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2435.8599999999997s)]
*  There might even be some women for whom the hot flashes do accelerate physical harm and [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2438.5s)]
*  others not, Thurston told me. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2442.68s)]
*  At a minimum, she says, reports of severe and frequent hot flashes should cue doctors [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2445.46s)]
*  to look more closely at a woman's cardiac health. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2450.8399999999997s)]
*  As Thurston was trying to determine the effects of hot flashes on vascular health, Pauline [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2455.0s)]
*  Mackey, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was establishing [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2459.9s)]
*  associations between hot flashes and mild cognitive changes during menopause. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2465.7000000000003s)]
*  Mackey had already found a clear correlation between the number of a woman's hot flashes [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2471.94s)]
*  and her memory performance. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2476.7200000000003s)]
*  Mackey and Thurston wondered if they would be able to detect some physical representation [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2479.7400000000002s)]
*  of that association in the brain. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2483.6600000000003s)]
*  They embarked on research published last October that found a strong correlation between the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2486.54s)]
*  number of hot flashes a woman has during sleep and signs of damage to the tiny vessels of [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2490.74s)]
*  the brain. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2495.74s)]
*  At a lab in Pittsburgh, which has one of the most powerful MRI machines in the world, Thurston [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2497.14s)]
*  showed me an image of a brain with tiny lesions represented as white dots, ghost-like absences [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2501.92s)]
*  on the scan. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2507.56s)]
*  Both their number and placement, she said, were different in women with high numbers [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2509.56s)]
*  of hot flashes. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2512.7s)]
*  But whether the hot flashes were causing the damage or the changes in the cerebral vessels [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2514.5s)]
*  were causing the hot flashes, she could not say. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2519.98s)]
*  About 20% of women experience cognitive decline during perimenopause and in the first years [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2524.26s)]
*  after menopause, mostly in the realm of verbal learning, the acquisition and synthesis of [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2529.5s)]
*  new information. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2535.46s)]
*  But the mechanisms of that decline are varied. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2536.94s)]
*  As estrogen levels drop, the region of the brain associated with verbal learning is thought [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2540.36s)]
*  to recruit others to support its functioning. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2545.2200000000003s)]
*  It's possible that this period of transition, when the brain is forming new pathways, accounts [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2549.06s)]
*  for the cognitive dip that some women experience. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2554.1800000000003s)]
*  For most of them, it's short-lived, a temporary neurological confusion. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2557.36s)]
*  A woman's gray matter, the cells that process information, also seem to shrink in volume [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2562.36s)]
*  before stabilizing in most women, according to Lisa Musconi, an associate professor of [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2569.12s)]
*  neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine and director of its Women's Brain Initiative. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2574.08s)]
*  She compares the process the brain undergoes during those years of transition to a kind [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2579.7400000000002s)]
*  of remodeling. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2584.2200000000003s)]
*  But the tiny brain lesions that Thurston and Macchi detected don't resolve. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2586.62s)]
*  They remain, contributing incrementally over many years to an increased risk of cognitive [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2591.42s)]
*  decline and dementia. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2596.98s)]
*  In the past 15 years, four randomized controlled trials found that taking estrogen had no effect [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2599.72s)]
*  on cognitive performance. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2606.48s)]
*  But those four studies, Macchi points out, did not look specifically at women with moderate [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2608.88s)]
*  to severe hot flashes. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2614.0s)]
*  She believes that might be the key factor. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2616.26s)]
*  Treat the hot flashes with estrogen, Macchi theorizes, and researchers might see an improvement [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2618.98s)]
*  in cognitive health. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2623.82s)]
*  In one small trial Macchi conducted of about 36 women, all of whom had moderate to severe [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2625.94s)]
*  hot flashes, half of the group received a kind of anesthesia procedure that reduced [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2631.18s)]
*  their hot flashes, and the other half received a placebo treatment. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2636.54s)]
*  She measured the cognitive function of both groups before the treatment and then three [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2641.02s)]
*  months after, and found that as hot flashes improved, memory improved. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2645.1s)]
*  The trial was small, but hypothesis generating, she says. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2650.78s)]
*  Even adjusting for greater longevity in women, Alzheimer's disease is more frequent in women [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2656.2200000000003s)]
*  than men, one of the many brain health discrepancies that have led researchers to wonder about [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2660.34s)]
*  the role that estrogen and possibly hormone therapy might play in the pathways of cognitive [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2665.1800000000003s)]
*  decline. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2671.0600000000004s)]
*  But the research on hormone therapy and Alzheimer's disease has proved inconclusive so far. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2672.7400000000002s)]
*  Whatever research exists on hormones in the brain focuses on postmenopausal women, which [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2679.3999999999996s)]
*  means it's impossible to know for now whether perimenopausal women could conceivably benefit [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2684.4399999999996s)]
*  from taking estrogen and progesterone during the temporary dip in their cognitive function. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2689.9199999999996s)]
*  There hasn't been a single randomized trial of hormone therapy for women in perimenopause, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2695.4399999999996s)]
*  Macchi says. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2700.0s)]
*  Egregious, right? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2701.0s)]
*  What's also unclear, Thurston says, is how the various phenomena of cognitive change [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2704.0s)]
*  during menopause, the temporary setbacks that resolve, the progress towards Alzheimer's [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2708.64s)]
*  in women with high genetic risk, and the onset of those markers of small vessel brain disease, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2714.44s)]
*  interact or reflect on one another. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2720.44s)]
*  We haven't followed women long enough to know, says Thurston, who believes that menopause [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2723.22s)]
*  care begins and ends with one crucial dictum. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  We need more research. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2731.64s)]
*  In the information void, a vast menopausal wellness industry has developed, flush with [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2737.0s)]
*  products that Fabian dismisses as mostly lotions and potions. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2742.4s)]
*  But a new crop of companies has also come to market to provide FDA-approved treatments, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2747.56s)]
*  including hormone therapy. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2752.68s)]
*  Midi Health offers virtual face-to-face access to menopause-trained doctors and nurse practitioners [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2754.56s)]

*  Other sites like Evernow and Alloy sell prescriptions directly to the patient. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2764.08s)]
*  Maki serves on the medical advisory boards of both Midi and Alloy. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2769.12s)]
*  On the Alloy website, a woman answers a series of questions about her symptoms, family, and [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2774.68s)]
*  medical history, and the company's algorithm recommends a prescription, or doesn't. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2779.12s)]
*  A prescribing doctor reviews the case and answers questions by text or phone, and if [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2784.48s)]
*  the woman decides to complete the order, she has access to that prescribing doctor by [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2789.36s)]
*  text for as long as the prescription is active. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2793.52s)]
*  Alloy holds online support groups where women, clearly of varying socioeconomic backgrounds, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2798.04s)]
*  often vent about how hard it was for them to find relief, how much they're still suffering, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2803.48s)]
*  or how traumatized they still are by the lack of compassion and concern they encountered [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  when seeking help for distressing symptoms. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2813.8s)]
*  On one call in July, a middle-aged woman described severe vaginal dryness. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2817.16s)]
*  When I was walking or trying just to exercise, I would be in such agony, she said. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2821.6s)]
*  It's painful just to move. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2827.16s)]
*  She was trying to buy vaginal estradiol cream, an extremely low-risk treatment for genitourinary [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2829.8799999999997s)]
*  syndrome. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2836.16s)]
*  She said there was a shortage of it in her small town. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2837.3199999999997s)]
*  Until she stumbled on Alloy, she'd been relying on antibacterial creams to soothe the pain [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2840.6s)]
*  she felt. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2845.36s)]
*  The space was clearly a no-judgment zone, a place where women could talk about how they [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2847.48s)]
*  personally felt about the risks and benefits of taking hormones. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2851.9s)]
*  At one meeting, a woman said that she'd been on hormone therapy, which she said, quote, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2856.6s)]
*  changed my life during perimenopause, but that she and her sister both had worrying [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2860.08s)]
*  mammograms at the same time. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2864.88s)]
*  Her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer and had her lymph nodes removed. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2867.54s)]
*  The woman on the call was diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, which is not cancer, but is considered [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2871.68s)]
*  a precursor that puts a woman at high risk. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2877.4s)]
*  The NAMS guidelines do not indicate that hormone therapy is contraindicated for a woman at [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2880.48s)]
*  high risk of breast cancer, leaving it up to the woman and her practitioner to decide. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2886.0s)]
*  My new OBGYN and my cancer doc won't put me on hormones, the woman said. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2891.72s)]
*  She bought them from Alloy instead. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2897.2999999999997s)]
*  So I'm kind of under the radar. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2899.98s)]
*  No one at the meeting questioned the woman's decision to go against the advice of two doctors. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2902.96s)]
*  I mentioned the case to Fabian. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2907.02s)]
*  It sounds to me like she felt like she wasn't being heard by her doctors and had to go somewhere [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2909.18s)]
*  else, she said. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2913.3s)]
*  Fabian told me that in certain circumstances, higher risk women who are fully informed of [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2914.86s)]
*  the risks but suffer terrible symptoms might reasonably make the decision to opt for hormones. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2919.62s)]
*  But she said those decisions require nuanced, thoughtful conversations with health care [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2925.9s)]
*  professionals. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2930.6600000000003s)]
*  And she wondered whether Alloy and other online providers were set up to allow for them. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2931.94s)]
*  Anne Fullenweiter, one of Alloy's founders, said the patient in the support group had [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2936.82s)]
*  not disclosed her full medical history when seeking a prescription. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2940.7400000000002s)]
*  After that came to light, an Alloy doctor reached out to her to have a more informed [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2944.82s)]
*  follow-up conversation about the risks and benefits of hormone therapy. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2948.7400000000002s)]
*  As I weighed my own options, I sometimes asked the doctors I interviewed outright for their advice. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2954.48s)]
*  For women in perimenopause who are still at risk for pregnancy, I learned a low-dose birth [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2960.0s)]
*  control can, quote, even things out, suppressing key parts of the reproductive system and supplying [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2964.8s)]
*  a steadier dose of hormones. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2970.68s)]
*  Another alternative is an intrauterine device, an IUD, to provide birth control, along with [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2973.52s)]
*  a low-dose estrogen patch, which is less potent than even a low-dose birth control pill and [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2978.96s)]
*  is therefore thought to be safer. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2984.52s)]
*  Too much equipment, I told Rachel Rubin, the sexual health expert, when she suggested it. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2986.8s)]
*  This is why I don't ski. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2991.88s)]
*  I found myself thinking often about an insight that Centoro says she offers for patients, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2994.0s)]
*  especially those under 60 and in good health. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=2999.68s)]
*  If you're having any symptoms, how can you weigh the risks and benefits if you haven't [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3002.96s)]
*  experienced the extent of the benefits? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3007.4s)]
*  In November, I started on a low-dose birth control pill. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3011.08s)]
*  I'm convinced, and those close to me are convinced, that my brain is more glitch-free. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3014.52s)]
*  I have no hot flashes. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3018.76s)]
*  More surprising to me, and perhaps the main reason for that improvement in cognition, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3021.86s)]
*  my sleep improved. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3026.6800000000003s)]
*  I had not even mentioned my poor quality of sleep to my gynecologist, given the length [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3028.76s)]
*  of our discussion. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3032.88s)]
*  But I had also assumed that it was a result of stress, age, and a sweet but snoring husband. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3034.56s)]
*  Only once I took the hormones did I appreciate that my regular 2 a.m. wakings, too, were [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3041.52s)]
*  most likely a symptom of perimenopause. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3046.08s)]
*  The pill was an easy enough experiment, but it carried a potentially higher risk of clots [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3049.32s)]
*  than the IUD and patch. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3054.12s)]
*  Now convinced that the effort of an IUD is worth it, I resolved to make that switch as [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3056.44s)]
*  soon as I could get an appointment. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3060.42s)]
*  How many women are doing some version of what I did? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3063.3s)]
*  Unsure of or explaining away menopausal symptoms? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3066.6600000000003s)]
*  Apologizing for complaining about discomforts they're not sure are significant? [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3070.6200000000003s)]
*  Quietly allowing the conversation to move on when they meet with their gynecologists [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3076.02s)]
*  or internists or family care doctors? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3080.1000000000004s)]
*  And yet, my more smoothly functioning brain goes round and round, wondering, worrying, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3083.3s)]
*  waiting for more high-quality research. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3090.18s)]
*  Maybe in the next decade, when my personal risks start escalating, we'll know more. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3093.94s)]
*  All I can hope is that it confirms the current trend towards research that reassures. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3099.2599999999998s)]
*  The science is continuing. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3103.98s)]
*  We wait for progress and hope it is as inevitable as aging itself. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL48Gc7tRro&t=3105.98s)]
