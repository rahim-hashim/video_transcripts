# Biden’s Slipping Support
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO0UncR0pi4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is a special episode of The Daily.
*  Today, a major Times poll finds that since President Biden's poor performance in the
*  first presidential debate, voters' doubts about his mental fitness have deepened, and
*  Donald Trump has taken by far his biggest lead of the campaign.
*  I spoke with my colleague Shane Goldmacher about what the results could mean for Biden's
*  future.
*  It's Thursday, July 4th.
*  Shane, thank you for coming on with not a ton of notice on a very busy day for you.
*  Happy to be on.
*  We don't normally publish an episode on a national holiday, July 4th, but we felt the
*  results of this poll were significant enough and newsworthy enough that it was worth departing
*  from that tradition.
*  I mean, in the time that I've been at the Times and covering our polls, this has been
*  by far the most anticipated poll that we've put out.
*  And the reason it's so anticipated is that tens of millions of Americans watched the
*  debate last week.
*  And one of the biggest questions about Joe Biden's political future has been, how did
*  voters actually process what they saw on stage?
*  Right.
*  What did they make of a Democratic nominee struggling openly at times to be coherent,
*  to offer cogent answers?
*  Would it affect the race?
*  That's been one of the fundamental questions.
*  And the storyline out of the White House and in Wilmington, where Biden's campaign is headquartered,
*  is that this debate was just a blip.
*  They put out their own survey showing that it hadn't made a change between before the
*  debate and after.
*  Notably they were behind in the survey that they released themselves.
*  But really people have been waiting for independent polling to take a look at the state of the
*  race after that debate.
*  And enter the New York Times, Sienna Poll.
*  What did we find on this very big, highly anticipated question?
*  We found that Donald Trump had the biggest lead he's ever had in a New York Times poll.
*  He's ahead of Joe Biden 49% to 43%.
*  So he has a six percentage point lead among likely voters and even larger nine percentage
*  points among registered voters.
*  Wow.
*  Nine percentage point is meaningful.
*  Yeah, and it's not just the size of his lead.
*  It's the direction.
*  So the race shifted three percentage points in Trump's direction in just the span of about
*  a week.
*  And the reason we know that is the Times actually pretty intentionally planned to do two polls.
*  One right before the debate to get a snapshot of the race heading into this key moment.
*  It was our first poll since Trump's conviction.
*  And it set a baseline.
*  Where did the race stand before these two men met on stage?
*  And then we began polling immediately after to figure out if and how the debate had changed
*  the dynamics.
*  And what we see are some real changes.
*  Right.
*  And just to summarize, a six point Trump lead over Biden among likely voters, a nine point
*  lead among registered voters and that three point swing, those are striking data points
*  in a race that has seemed very close throughout and was expected to be very close in the end.
*  I really think it's the totality of the poll that makes it a significant snapshot of the
*  state of the race.
*  You have the overall margin with Donald Trump leading by more than he's ever led in a New
*  York Times poll.
*  And you have on the critical question of age for an 81 year old president who just struggled
*  to perform on the national stage, growing concerns about his ability to govern.
*  And it's basically everyone in the poll, a majority of every demographic, geographic
*  and ideological group that we tested thought that Joe Biden is too old to be an effective
*  president.
*  And that includes people who are voting for Joe Biden.
*  How much did that perception of Biden's age and is he too old to be president change since
*  the debate?
*  So before the debate, Democrats already had concerns about Joe Biden's ability to do the
*  job and those concerns got bigger after the debate.
*  They rose eight percentage points, 59 percent of his own party.
*  And as worrisome for the Biden campaign, they also rose further among independents, all
*  the way up to 79 percent.
*  Overall what percentage of everyone polled says that President Biden is too old to be
*  an effective president?
*  Overall 74 percent of voters in the survey said that Joe Biden is too old to be an effective
*  president.
*  Wow.
*  As you said, Shane, a meaningful percentage of the voters we polled will still vote for
*  Biden despite these concerns because he's getting, I think the number was 43 percent
*  of the vote, which means some meaningful group of those who are concerned about his age are
*  still going to vote for him.
*  So I'm curious when you really get into the results of this poll, which voters do you
*  find since the debate have thrown their support behind Trump and have helped him get this
*  six point or nine point lead, depending on how you slice it over Biden?
*  I can give you an answer with just one word and it's men.
*  The voters who swung to Donald Trump in this survey pretty decisively were men.
*  He was leading among men going into the debate.
*  He was leading by 12 percentage points among men before the debate.
*  Afterward, that lead has almost doubled to 23 percentage points.
*  How do you think about that?
*  It makes a lot of sense in the framing that Donald Trump has taken to the race overall,
*  which is this sort of machismo that he campaigns on his entire frame for the 2024 election
*  is one of strength versus weakness.
*  His campaign has been designed to appeal in a lot of ways to men.
*  After he was convicted of falsifying records related to, don't forget, a hush money payment
*  made to a porn star, the first event he did was at a UFC fight and he stayed until one
*  in the morning.
*  There is this sort of male energy that the Trump campaign has very intentionally tried
*  to tap into.
*  And I think a debate that showed him in much more command than Joe Biden seems to have
*  jostled some of these men in his direction.
*  Right. And of course, for most of the Trump era, women voters have voted much more heavily
*  for Democrats. And in the post debate poll, Joe Biden's lead among women actually ticked
*  up too. He is now leading by eight percentage points.
*  The problem for him is that lead is so much smaller than the Trump advantage among men.
*  Shane, was there any good news in this poll for President Biden?
*  How much would you like to squint, Michael?
*  I think there are some glimmers of good news for Joe Biden.
*  We talked about how independents now see Joe Biden as increasingly old and really look
*  on that age question a lot like Republicans at this point.
*  In the top line question of do you pick Biden or Trump right now?
*  Trump actually lost a small amount of ground in this survey among independent voters.
*  It's just that he gained so much more among Republicans and Biden lost so much more among
*  Democrats that it ended up being a net negative for Joe Biden.
*  Interesting. Thus, glimmer, not really necessarily pure good news.
*  The other glimmer of good news for Joe Biden is that while Democrats are increasingly
*  worried about how old he is, they actually didn't move away from him on the basic question
*  of should he remain the Democratic Party's nominee.
*  The share of Democratic voters who think he should no longer be the Democratic nominee
*  ticked up ever so slightly.
*  But it's not a significant movement away from Biden in a way that some of his advisors
*  might have feared.
*  That's interesting.
*  Interesting. And I suppose good news for Biden after this debate.
*  But I recall our guest on the debate night when we did that episode of Stad Herndon
*  reminding us that the point of this debate, the reason why Joe Biden agreed to do this
*  debate was to try to reassure Democrats of his place as the nominee and to hopefully
*  in a poll like this find that more and more Democrats want him to be the nominee and
*  aren't worried about that.
*  It doesn't sound like this poll finds that at all.
*  I mean, this is one of the fundamental things that the Biden campaign was trying to
*  accomplish. They wanted to reunite the Democratic Party behind him to get people to
*  focus on the contrast, the threat of Donald Trump, to rally behind Joe Biden as the one
*  and only alternative to stopping Donald Trump this fall, to take a race that a lot of
*  people have tuned out and get them to tune in.
*  And what the poll found is that, yes, more people are paying more attention to the race
*  now. But on those questions of are Democrats further behind Joe Biden, it actually
*  added questions to that rather than answering them.
*  I want to ask about something that people around the president are saying a lot since
*  this debate happened, which is bad debates happen.
*  They point to the fact, for example, that President Obama had a rough debate against
*  Mitt Romney in 2012.
*  He dipped in the polls, came back.
*  How are you and your reporting and thinking about this poll contemplating the idea that
*  what we're seeing here is a momentary problem for President Biden, not necessarily a
*  permanent one?
*  I think there's a big fundamental difference between the 2012 race, which you're right.
*  Barack Obama had a bad night.
*  He did dip in the polls.
*  He recovered and he won pretty comfortably by the end of that race.
*  And what we saw in this debate, which is the struggles that Joe Biden had fed into the
*  fundamental questions and weaknesses that he's had in this entire election, which is
*  voters questions about his ability to serve as president at age 81 and to continue to
*  serve as president until age 86.
*  And so it wasn't just about, oh, well, he gave a really bad answer on Medicare or he
*  gave a really bad answer on the economy or he flubbed the taxes question or he didn't
*  answer abortion.
*  Right.
*  Because by the way, he did have those particular issue struggles.
*  The bigger problem for him in the debate is that on the question that most voters have
*  about him, can he continue to do the job?
*  They left with an answer that left them less confident in his ability to do the job.
*  And in that way, it's fundamentally different than the Obama campaign in 2012.
*  So, Shane, it's hard to imagine this poll doing anything to quiet the very real panic
*  that has erupted within the Democratic Party over Biden's candidacy.
*  If anything, I have to suspect it's going to deepen it.
*  Look, Michael, the campaign was so worried about this poll that they actually sent out
*  an internal staff memo on Wednesday morning, pre-budding the findings, kind of dismissing
*  the result before they even knew what it was.
*  And the reason why is that the Biden campaign has been nervous.
*  This is the kind of empirical evidence that can be used to try to push him out of the
*  race, which is something that prominent Democrats have already started to do.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Shane, let's talk about how this has all been playing out within the Democratic
*  Party, within the Biden campaign over the past few days.
*  And as you hinted at just before the break, how this new polling is potentially going
*  to fit into that.
*  And just to note, in our last episode about this with our colleague, Peter Baker, the
*  discussion, the idea of replacing Biden as nominee because of this debate performance
*  had mostly been confined to pundits and a handful of former elected officials, which
*  had given it an air of being kind of a fringe conversation.
*  My sense is that that started to change.
*  So just bring us up to speed.
*  Yeah, it has moved from cable pundits to Capitol Hill.
*  And that is a very important shift.
*  I think like a lot of people, I was pretty horrified by the debate.
*  You had Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a liberal from Rhode Island, saying he was horrified.
*  Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell says one interview isn't going to fix this.
*  You have some important members of Congress in key swing states like Michigan.
*  I want to see him talk to the American people.
*  Saying that voters are worried about this issue.
*  And tell them why he can do the job and what he's going to deliver and that he's got
*  the stamina to do it.
*  And then on Tuesday, you really had the beginning of a dam break.
*  And we don't know just how big the leak is going to be yet, but we do know that he's
*  leaking important support.
*  As a college student, I did a lot of debating.
*  You had Jim Clyburn, who is one of the president's closest allies, who delivered an
*  endorsement to Joe Biden in 2020 that helped deliver him the presidency and the
*  Democratic nomination.
*  This party should not in any way do anything to work around Ms. Harris.
*  He began talking about what he would do if Joe Biden wasn't, in fact, the leader.
*  We should do everything we can to bolster her, whether it's in second place or at the
*  top of the ticket.
*  And he said he would back his vice president, Kamala Harris.
*  And then you had Nancy Pelosi.
*  We all have been in touch with people close to the president.
*  So it's not a question of not having an opportunity to make our concerns known or...
*  Who's one of the most revered names in Democratic politics.
*  Almost going a step further.
*  Now, again, I think it's a legitimate question to say, is this an episode or is this a
*  condition?
*  And saying the questions about Joe Biden's mental fitness, those questions that we saw
*  jumping among Democrats in our poll, that that is a legitimate line of inquiry for the
*  public.
*  Now, her spokesperson later said she still continues to support Joe Biden, but it's
*  pretty hard to unring a bell like, is this an episode or is this a condition?
*  You know, when my wife and I watched the debate last Thursday, we were so hoping for the
*  momentum to overcome the lag that we've had.
*  And of course, Joe Biden then had the first Democratic member of Congress officially call
*  for him to step aside.
*  And that's Lloyd Doggett, a progressive from Texas.
*  I was so moved by that evening that the next morning I was out to talk on the floor of
*  Congress with our leadership and with as many of my colleagues as I could find to express
*  the view that it was time for a replacement and for President Biden to step aside.
*  Right. And as we're sitting here, and I should say we're talking at around 4 p.m.
*  on Wednesday, literally at this precise moment, I'm seeing that another sitting
*  Democratic congressman, Raul Grijalva from Arizona, has also come out and publicly
*  called for Biden to step aside as nominee.
*  This has to be President Biden's nightmare to Democratic congress members saying, get
*  out of the race.
*  I mean, this is exactly the kind of drumbeat that Joe Biden has been seeking to avoid.
*  Where do you think and based on your reporting and the reporting of our colleagues, Shane,
*  has this left Biden in his thinking on the eve of July 4th?
*  The president and his team have been doing two things at once.
*  On Wednesday, President Biden and his vice president, Kamala Harris, both joined an all
*  staff conference call of his campaign team and reiterated that he's going to be in this
*  race until the very end.
*  But my colleague, Katie Rogers, has reported on some private conversations that President
*  Biden has had with key allies in which he has told them that he understands the coming
*  days are absolutely critical to salvaging his candidacy.
*  Now, I should say that the White House has denied that reporting.
*  But Democrats pretty much across the spectrum at this point are saying that Joe Biden needs
*  to reassure the American people about his ability to serve.
*  And that's important, Shane, because that reporting from Katie Rogers suggests a self
*  awareness on the part of Biden that he might not make it, that there are conditions under
*  which he would and wouldn't make it.
*  And that, of course, makes me wonder, what does Biden think might make or break this
*  moment for him?
*  I think it's worth pausing for a second and thinking about what it took to get those first
*  members of Congress to call for him to step aside and for Nancy Pelosi in particular to
*  express her frustrations out loud, which is silence.
*  There's really been silence from Joe Biden since this debate night.
*  He went the next day and had a rally that his campaign team was really pleased with
*  in North Carolina, where he said, I'm not a young man anymore and I don't speak as
*  smoothly as I used to and I don't walk as well as I used to.
*  And they took those remarks and they packaged it into a television ad and they're putting
*  that on the airwaves.
*  But what Joe Biden hasn't done is speak unscripted since that debate night.
*  He used a teleprompter at that rally in North Carolina and he did a series of fundraisers
*  and even behind closed doors in the Hamptons, he used a teleprompter with his donors,
*  which raised some concerns about why isn't he speaking unscripted even with us?
*  Right. Why isn't he deliberately trying to demonstrate his ability to be extemporaneous,
*  to fight this growing perception that if left to his own devices, he will have problems
*  communicating? Yeah.
*  The question that it raises is why would you not put him out there more?
*  And so this private conversation that he had and some of his other actions tell you that
*  the Biden team and the president himself know that he needs to go out and fix this problem.
*  And to address that, he's meeting with a series of governors, key Democratic governors and
*  allies from across the country, some of whom are flying into Washington, D.C.
*  to hold this meeting. He's sitting down for an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos.
*  And then he's hitting the campaign trail over the weekend in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
*  And the president clearly at this point knows that each of these encounters are a high
*  stake moment where people are going to judge his readiness and capacity for the job.
*  I just want to end this conversation by reflecting on what I think it's safe to say is
*  the pretty extraordinary nature of this moment.
*  We are four months out from the election and it very much seems day by day, hour by hour,
*  poll by poll as if President Biden's nomination could be teetering on the edge.
*  It may never get to that point.
*  He may absolutely, you know, as he says, remain the nominee until the end.
*  But that's where we are right now, is that people are asking that question.
*  They're asking it openly. They're asking it within the Democratic Party.
*  And it feels very fraud and momentous.
*  Joe Biden made a bet that the earliest debate in presidential history was going to help
*  him consolidate the Democratic Party and unite everyone to take on Trump this fall.
*  And so far, it's done just the opposite.
*  He's facing more questions than he has allowed from Democrats.
*  From almost two years about his capacity to lead the party.
*  But the issues at hand, Joe Biden's age, are not a new one.
*  When he ran for president in 2020, he talked about being a bridge to the next generation.
*  And when he announced that he was going to run again, a lot of Democratic voters were
*  surprised. The Democratic Party moved pretty quickly to squash any chance that there would
*  be any real opposition to Joe Biden in 2024.
*  They reordered the nominating calendar.
*  They put his strongest state first and they made sure that no serious Democrat challenged
*  him for the nomination.
*  But he's been in something really, though, of a staring contest with his party's voters
*  for the last few years who have had doubts about his age and him remaining their standard
*  bearer. And for the first time in that staring contest, a few prominent members of his own
*  party are saying it may be time for President Biden to blink and step aside.
*  Well, Shane, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it. Thanks for having me on.
*  For more on the fallout from the debate, check out this week's episode of The Runup, where
*  ASTED is hearing from voters around the country and asking them how they're now feeling about
*  their options. You can find The Runup wherever you listen.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  Hurricane Barrel, after devastating two small islands in Grenada, struck Jamaica and the
*  Cayman Islands on Wednesday as a powerful Category 4 storm.
*  According to local officials, the damage on two of Grenada's islands, Karakou and Petit
*  Martinique, was catastrophic.
*  About 98 percent of the buildings on the islands have been damaged or destroyed, including
*  Karakou's main hospital, airport and marinas.
*  During a news conference, Grenada's prime minister said, quote, We have to rebuild from
*  the ground up.
