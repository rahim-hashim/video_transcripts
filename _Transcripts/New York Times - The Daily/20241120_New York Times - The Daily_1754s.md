# The Appeal of the Smaller Breast
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McKKEe0VGP0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily.
*  For decades, breast augmentations have been one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries
*  in America.
*  But in recent years, a new trend has started to emerge—the breast reduction.
*  Today, my colleague Lisa Miller, on understanding the appeal of the smaller breast.
*  It's Wednesday, November 20th.
*  Hi Lisa.
*  Hi Rachel.
*  So, you recently wrote a story about something that I am pretty sure we haven't covered
*  on The Daily before, and that topic is breast reductions.
*  And I'd really love to hear, before we get into it, why you wrote about it and why it
*  interested you.
*  Sure.
*  I work on the Well Desk at the New York Times, and Well is the area of the Times that covers
*  health and wellness, nutrition, fitness.
*  I am particularly interested in the subject of women's bodies and how it feels to be
*  in a female body walking around in the world.
*  So those are the kinds of stories that I do.
*  So my colleague, Stella Bugby, who is the editor of the Styles Desk, handed me these
*  numbers one day.
*  And the numbers were from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and they showed this
*  dramatic increase in breast reductions over the last five years, driven by women under
*  30.
*  And she was just like, what do you think is going on here?
*  So I just set about sort of exploring both why the trend and also sort of what was in
*  women's heads as they were making these decisions.
*  Can you tell us a little bit about those numbers specifically?
*  What did they show and what were they?
*  So in 2023, which is the last year for which data are available, more than 76,000 women
*  had breast reductions.
*  And these are not surgeries that have to do with cancer and they're not gender-affirming
*  surgeries.
*  These are surgeries that insurance companies deem to be cosmetic.
*  And it was just an astonishing jump from pre-pandemic when the number was more like 40,000.
*  And to be sure, the most popular cosmetic breast surgery in the country is breast
*  augmentation still.
*  These numbers are tiny in comparison to the numbers of women who are getting augmentations.
*  300,000 about get an augmentation every year.
*  But those numbers are creeping downward and the reduction numbers are going upward, not
*  just among young women, but among women in every age group.
*  You know, it's funny, I feel like I too have noticed this trend towards smaller breasts
*  in popular culture.
*  I can't really put my finger on it exactly, but I feel like I've walked into stores where
*  you see dresses that you really can only wear if you have small breasts.
*  It feels like there are more models with small breasts on the runway.
*  And I've noticed this sort of anecdotally here and there, but I didn't realize at all
*  that that trend was actually something quantifiable and showing up in data somewhere.
*  Totally.
*  I mean, I was thinking about this before I came to record this session and I was like,
*  it's a little bit like learning a new word and then you hear that word everywhere.
*  Yes, totally.
*  So, you know, I saw these numbers and I was like, hmm.
*  And then I went out into the world and like in Brooklyn where I live, so many young women
*  are wearing like tank tops and camisoles without bras, slip dresses without bras.
*  In a way where I went to report the story, I saw all these women wearing these smock
*  dresses where you couldn't wear a bra.
*  I'm well aware of the smock dress.
*  And so it just it really did feel like it was everywhere all at once.
*  And also, I mean, it just sort of runs counter to I think a lot of the imagery that like
*  we've grown up with in terms of what was on television.
*  Like there's a reason why breast augmentation surgeries got so big.
*  I mean, you know, when I was growing up, being flat chested was a mortification.
*  Nobody wanted to be flat chested.
*  I remember this distinctly from high school.
*  Everybody admired the girls with bigger boobs.
*  The big girls with bigger boobs like showed off in the locker room.
*  This was the 80s.
*  And you know, that was the era of silicone breast implants.
*  That was the era of big breasted models.
*  Dolly Parton.
*  Dolly Parton.
*  I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up Hooters, which I do not feel like you could have launched
*  that now.
*  That is a big restaurant chain that launched I think in the 80s or 90s.
*  Totally it was all okay.
*  And not only was it all okay, it was all desirable.
*  I mean, as one of the women I spoke to for the story said to me, like, when you have
*  big breasts, you're winning.
*  She's like, that's what culture thinks about big breasts.
*  And when you go back, that goes back to post-World War II voluptuousness, right?
*  Like Marilyn Monroe leads into Baywatch, leads into Kardashians.
*  It's this kind of ostentatious display of femaleness.
*  Big breasts meant power.
*  They meant sex.
*  They meant motherhood.
*  They were something that men wanted.
*  And if you had them, you know, it was money in the bank.
*  And so by the 2010s, breast augmentation, which had gotten more and more and more sophisticated,
*  the implants had gotten more and more and more natural looking, was the most popular
*  cosmetic surgery in the country.
*  350,000 women a year were getting a breast augmentation.
*  Everything you're saying, I mean, all of our experiences, I think, add up to the idea that
*  it's not groundbreaking to say that Americans have been pretty obsessed with the female
*  breast, right?
*  No, not at all.
*  It's not groundbreaking.
*  I mean, there's been this obsession with breasts in culture for, you know, ever.
*  What surprised me as I was doing the reporting was the extent to which the obsession not
*  only extended into the medical community, but actually originated with it.
*  I had a conversation with a plastic surgeon who was a woman, and she was telling me about
*  this paper that was published in 2011 in a plastic surgery journal in which an English
*  plastic surgeon described the contours of the ideal breast.
*  The ideal breast.
*  The ideal breast.
*  Just one.
*  I mean, and he used that language in the paper, in this medical journal.
*  And this text became foundational.
*  It became like a training text for generations of doctors.
*  And in the introduction to the paper, he talks about how, you know, Leonardo da Vinci defined
*  the contours of the ideal human face.
*  And he put this effort into that context.
*  Like he was helping the profession of plastic surgeons create and improve breasts for the
*  world.
*  He had this idea that the ideal breast was sort of concave below the nipple and sort
*  of flat above the nipple.
*  So he was very specific in the shape of the ideal breast.
*  But no one has breasts like this.
*  No one has breasts like this.
*  And yet the conventions around what a breast should look like are so strong and so established
*  that when a woman walks into a plastic surgeon's office, and remember, you know, four fifths
*  of them are men, she says, I want something smaller.
*  They say, well, your husband might not like that.
*  Or you should try losing some weight first.
*  Or I like them rounder.
*  And there's a whole Reddit thread where women tell these stories to each other about walking
*  into plastic surgeons' offices and asking for smaller breasts and the feedback they
*  get.
*  It makes them feel like what they're asking for is crazy.
*  So obviously, Lisa, breast reduction sounds like a very self-evident term.
*  But just for the sake of it, can you walk us through what the surgery actually entails?
*  Yes, sure.
*  So the surgery usually involves, you know, making an incision around the nipple and then
*  from the nipple down the length of the breast, the curved part of the breast, and then removing
*  a lot of breast tissue from inside the breast.
*  A thing that's really important to say here is that most of the women who go in for breast
*  reduction have double D cups or bigger.
*  And these days, the plastic surgeons told me, most women are asking for a B cup, whereas
*  five years ago, they were wanting a C cup.
*  So they're asking for more breast tissue to be removed.
*  And you know, Kelly Colleen, who was one of the surgeons I spoke to for my story, I was
*  talking to her in her office.
*  She was wearing her scrubs.
*  And I was like, but how much breast tissue are we talking about, actually?
*  And she reached down and picked a Coke can up out of her garbage can and she was like,
*  I just took this much breast tissue out of one breast in a patient.
*  Oh my God.
*  You know, it's a lot.
*  And so it's a much more invasive surgery than augmentation.
*  And it has all of these potential consequences that are enduring.
*  It can affect a woman's ability to breastfeed.
*  They're not great data on this, but the best study says about a third of the time.
*  It can affect nipple sensation.
*  And there's permanent scars that frequently go around the nipple, down the breast, under
*  the breast.
*  And the women are really making a big trade.
*  You know, they're saying, I'm willing to do all of these things in order for my breasts
*  to be smaller.
*  And so when they decide to make, as you said, that big trade and get the surgery anyway,
*  what does it end up costing them?
*  The American Society of Plastic Surgeons says it costs about between $7,000 and $8,000.
*  I spoke to a lot of plastic surgeons for the story and none of them charge that little.
*  Most of them charge somewhere between $10,000 and $15,000 with the high-end surgeons in
*  New York and LA charging as much as $20,000.
*  So it's a lot.
*  And this is a surgery that can technically be covered by insurance, but the algorithms
*  and formulas involved are extremely complex and the bar is really high and most women
*  don't end up being covered.
*  And so what that means is that there are women with very large breasts who may be experiencing
*  some to a lot of pain who have to pay for this surgery out of pocket.
*  And that is very frustrating to them and to their doctors.
*  And the more I talked to the women, the more I understood that in every woman there's
*  some combination when she walks into a surgeon's office asking for this surgery of pain, discomfort
*  and a desire to have a different shaped body that is really different from what she had before.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Lisa, tell us more about what you actually ended up learning about people's motivations
*  when you started talking to them.
*  Yeah, I mean, what I learned was that every individual woman has a variety of reasons
*  for wanting this surgery.
*  That there is no single reason.
*  And the question is really like, which is the thing that tips the scale and makes the
*  woman decide to do it?
*  And so I talked to a lot of women in person and on the phone, but I also spent a lot of
*  time on social media and I'd love to talk about my boobs on the Internet.
*  So let's go ahead.
*  There is a huge breast reduction conversation happening on TikTok, on Instagram, on YouTube.
*  I'm getting a breast reduction because it's just always been a struggle.
*  And from immersing myself in all of this conversation over many, many weeks, I would recommend a
*  breast reduction to anyone considering it.
*  I would say that there are three main reasons why women decide to reduce their breasts.
*  And the first one is just physical pain, OK, physical pain, straight up pain.
*  My back was constantly in pain.
*  I could not walk for more than a mile without having to stop.
*  A woman with very large breasts often has back pain, shoulder pain, neck pain.
*  I used to actually get chest pain sometimes because I used to feel like I was getting
*  suffocated by my chest when I would lay down or wear tight clothing.
*  Often there's rashes underneath her breasts.
*  She can get headaches from the pain.
*  It can be a real struggle.
*  It is physically painful to wear most types of bras, tops, tank tops, anything that supports them.
*  Pain.
*  So there is a medical need.
*  Pain aside, I also used to find it hard to find clothes sometimes.
*  Another is a sort of a fashion impulse.
*  I could not really shop at regular department stores because none of the clothes really catered to my body.
*  Which is just that if you've grown up with bigger breasts, you've been wearing constraining
*  clothes for your whole life.
*  Wearing swimsuits.
*  That was always hard.
*  Getting the right swimsuit, finding the right bra.
*  It's so difficult to find bras that fit you.
*  And almost every single woman I talked to for the story said that her aspiration going
*  in was to buy a bra or a bikini at Target.
*  Like spend $15, buy something off the rack, have it be cute and sexy and carefree.
*  Any store you can think of, I've probably gone there and like they didn't have my size
*  because they don't really carry 30 to and under.
*  Finding clothes that fit comfortably.
*  That's it.
*  That's the reason.
*  I was a 30-H when I was 15.
*  So you can imagine the stairs I got.
*  And I think, you know, this is a third bucket, but it really encompasses everybody.
*  When you grow up with very large breasts, especially if you're very young.
*  Just weird, weird men.
*  And just stairs all the time.
*  Which as a 15-year-old being self-conscious anyway, was not nice.
*  You are objectified and sexualized from an incredibly young age.
*  At 16 years old, you have these jugs that grown men are looking at and sexualizing.
*  People look at you.
*  People have thoughts about you.
*  People think you're sexually active when you are not.
*  Everybody said this to me.
*  People always say you look like a whore.
*  You look like a slut because I constantly have my boobs out.
*  And honestly, I won't try to have my boobs out.
*  A lot of women talk to me about shame they felt from their moms, from their teachers,
*  from their siblings.
*  I was bullied because I told this guy I didn't want to be his girlfriend and he ain't a
*  fun of my chest.
*  One woman told me that everybody in her neighborhood called her fast because she had very large
*  breasts as a child.
*  And she had a lot of older brothers and they basically didn't let her out of the house
*  alone.
*  And I went to the bathroom and I cried.
*  So I think, you know, I think it's intuitive that it's hard to be that girl.
*  But talking to these women really brought that home for me.
*  They're carrying a lot and they're carrying a lot for a long time.
*  And so when they have a chance to change that, they do.
*  But also just listening to you tick off the reasons why women might want the surgery,
*  I can kind of imagine people reacting with different levels of acceptance, depending
*  on how quote unquote legitimate they decide the reasons are.
*  For example, somebody has an aesthetic desire versus a medical need.
*  You can see how people would respond differently about whether they personally felt that the
*  surgery was, like I said, legitimate.
*  And it kind of reminds me of how people lie about having a nose job.
*  Like they say, oh, I had a deviated septum because, you know, people are not super open
*  about this stuff always about plastic surgery.
*  And so I'm curious for all of these reasons, do women who get breast reductions, do they
*  feel pressure to like justify their decision in some way?
*  Is this something they talk about openly?
*  Like I can't even say how much not at all.
*  Hello, boobie besties.
*  I'm calling you guys.
*  Really?
*  Like not at all.
*  So I am a one month post-op and I only have positive things to say.
*  Instead of being embarrassed about plastic surgery or lying about it or hiding it, all
*  of the girlies that said that your confidence skyrockets could not be a truer statement.
*  Women tell women about their breast reduction.
*  So I just took my three month post-op photos and I'm going to show you literally like showing
*  their breasts to each other.
*  Here they are.
*  I cannot believe how they look.
*  My girls are perfect now.
*  They're the same size.
*  They're nice and perky.
*  They're not bothering me now.
*  They're just doing their thing.
*  Love them.
*  It was the best decision I've ever made.
*  There are of course women who are unhappy with the results.
*  I'm here to be that person to tell you that there are negative things and they're not
*  worth having smaller boobs.
*  Women have gotten terrible infections.
*  Takes a long time to recover from them.
*  But the vast majority expressed no regret or doubt.
*  If you are thinking about getting that breast reduction, do it.
*  Yeah, shout out to these, you know.
*  What else can I say?
*  And why do you think that is?
*  I think it's a lot of reasons.
*  We are in a post-me too moment and young women are really determined to get in charge of
*  how they're perceived in the world and not let their particular body parts be their introduction
*  into any room.
*  They want to control their presentation.
*  They want to be able to cover up or expose as they wish.
*  They don't want to be part of the sort of male gaze industrial complex at all.
*  So that's one reason.
*  And the other is that especially young women like Gen Z women have a very different relationship
*  to their bodies than my generation does.
*  They are really avid consumers of plastic surgery in general.
*  They do arm reductions and fillers and eyelid stuff and stuff I haven't ever even heard
*  of not being a consumer of plastic surgery really.
*  They have just a much more open idea about being able to change their body as part of
*  self-expression that is not an idea I grew up with.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  We grew up feeling ashamed, embarrassed that we were flat chested or skinny or whatever,
*  not voluptuous or whatever, whatever.
*  And then we became enlightened as young women and at that moment we were like, no, no, I'm
*  perfect.
*  All of my cellulite is perfect and my gray hairs are perfect and my big nose is perfect.
*  And this sort of aligns with the body acceptance movement, right?
*  You don't have to be some kind of ideal going back to the plastic surgeon in the medical
*  journal.
*  You don't have to hew to that.
*  That is not your problem.
*  That is not your business.
*  Stand up and love yourself in every shape that you have.
*  And so when I approached the Gen Z women and I was like, why do you want to do this?
*  there's pain and health concerns here.
*  What I was probing for, what I was poking at is like, don't you think you're perfect
*  already?
*  Why do you want to change your body?
*  And what they said was surprising, which was like, no, no, I am doing this for me.
*  This is autonomy.
*  And if I want a different kind of breast in order to wear a different kind of outfit or
*  present in a different kind of way, that's not an admission that I'm capitulating.
*  That's an expression of autonomy and independence and freedom, liberation.
*  I just can't help but think like as you're talking about this, that this feels both new
*  because we're talking about a trend of breast reductions, which is a new thing.
*  But it also feels like kind of a age old argument as long as plastic surgery has been around.
*  This debate of like, are you doing it for you as truly empowering?
*  And even if you think it's truly empowering and you're doing it for you, you're actually
*  doing it for somebody else.
*  And what do we think the right answer is for like, who's allowed to do what?
*  Even if a woman says she's doing it for one reason, we can't always trust her that she
*  understands her reason.
*  So it feels like what's old is new again, I guess a little bit.
*  I completely agree with you.
*  And I thought about that a lot as I was reporting the story.
*  Like why am I second guessing the reasons that they're telling me?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And one of the most revelatory conversations I had was a conversation I had with a plus
*  size model who sort of confessed that she was considering a breast reduction.
*  And you know, she makes her living being a person in a different body than the conventional
*  ideal.
*  And yet she too was attracted by this idea that she might be able to unencumber herself
*  by reducing her breasts.
*  I presented this dilemma to her like, aren't you supposed to just love who you are?
*  She was like, yes, yes.
*  But we all live in the world.
*  We all take our bodies out into the world.
*  And we get catcalled and we get looked at and we get judged and people think things
*  about us.
*  And it is impossible to be a female person in the world and not absorb those signals.
*  And so although in some ideal universe, we're able to live in our, you know, God given bodies
*  with happiness and ease, in the real world, that is impossible.
*  So given all of this, where did you actually land you yourself as the reporter who happens
*  to be a person in the world on this question of who is this for and whether this is just
*  yet another way to make women feel inadequate about our bodies?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes to both.
*  Yes.
*  Plus one.
*  Like, I think that the minute you try to make women choose, you're missing the point.
*  And I see this in my own life, right?
*  Like I have a daughter and I made sure always to tell her how beautiful she is, no matter
*  what.
*  And I want her to grow up with a sense that like nothing about her body is a thing to
*  be ashamed of or corrected or fixed or inadequate.
*  Like that is the identity I hope that she carries through the world.
*  At the same time, I had breast cancer several years ago and I had a breast reconstruction.
*  And so as I think I alluded to, like I am not a plastic surgery person.
*  That is not my natural choice.
*  And yet the breast cancer forced me to have a breast reconstruction.
*  And what I will say about that is that my breasts look better.
*  They just do.
*  They just do.
*  I'm, you know, a middle-aged, late middle-aged woman.
*  They had some miles on them.
*  I breastfed my daughter.
*  I ran two marathons.
*  Like the lifted breast is like nice.
*  And so although I wouldn't have chosen it and I formerly would have had all kinds of
*  judgment about it, I feel that it is an enhancement.
*  So who am I to judge?
*  Well, Lisa, it's been a pleasure.
*  Thank you so much.
*  It's been a pleasure.
*  I love being here.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  President-elect Trump continued a series of surprising choices for top roles in his second
*  administration, picking celebrity physician Dr.
*  Mehmet Oz to oversee the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Howard Lutnick,
*  a Wall Street executive who's leading Trump's transition team, to serve as Commerce Secretary.
*  Lutnick, the head of financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, would be in charge of an agency
*  with an $11 billion budget and wide influence over broad swaths of the economy.
*  The choice of Dr. Oz, who's faced criticism for his sometimes dubious medical advice,
*  comes after Trump chose Robert F.
*  Kennedy Jr., a notable vaccine skeptic, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.
*  In his announcement, Trump said that the two men would work together to, quote,
*  take on the illness industrial complex.
