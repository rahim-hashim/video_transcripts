# Harvard Is Trying to Resist Trump. It Might Not Be Working.
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA)
*  Today is graduation day and I'm exhausted. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm a Harvard student and over the last few months, we've just been watching the news [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=10.08s)]
*  scared and we've somehow become pawns in this political culture war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=17.0s)]
*  Trump has been coming up with new ways every single day of how to come after us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=26.16s)]
*  We're currently in month four and we have a long time to go with this administration [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  so we really don't have a lot of hope that this is going away anytime soon. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=39.72s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is The Daily. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=46.28s)]
*  I've been very proud to see the university stand up and resist what I think are overreaches [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=50.16s)]
*  from the Trump administration. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=54.76s)]
*  It's not an easy thing to unite a place as opinionated as Harvard and yet Trump has succeeded [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=56.28s)]
*  in doing exactly that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=60.4s)]
*  For Harvard students, this year's graduation ceremony comes amid an intense standoff between [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=62.28s)]
*  one of America's most prestigious universities and the United States government. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=67.84s)]
*  I definitely think that some of the administration's criticism of Harvard is valid. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=71.72s)]
*  I've been frustrated by how left-leaning a lot of the courses are but I don't think [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=76.64s)]
*  The federal government should be trying to force Harvard's hand in this way to fix them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=82.44s)]
*  In particular, the Trump administration is trying to cut the school's federal funding [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  and eliminate student visas. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  I'm really concerned about the research that's lost and the projects that are going to be [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=93.0s)]
*  halted halfway through because of these funding cuts. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=96.22s)]
*  We as international students are asking ourselves constantly in each other, what control do [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  we now have over our lives? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  We feel bullied by this administration and we just don't really know where to go from here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=107.44s)]
*  Today, my colleague Mike Schmidt on how that conflict escalated and what it reveals about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=115.32s)]
*  how far the administration will go to execute its agenda. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=120.4s)]
*  It's Thursday, May 29th. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=133.76s)]
*  So Mike, we know that the Trump administration has targeted a wide range of universities. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=137.44s)]
*  The campaign that they have waged against Harvard though, in particular, it really feels [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=148.04s)]
*  distinct from what's happened at other schools. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=153.04s)]
*  And we've seen this fight really ratcheting up over the last few days with the news about [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=156.0s)]
*  more funding cuts and this attempted ban on international students. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=160.0s)]
*  How would you characterize this fight and why is it so different? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=164.6s)]
*  We are seeing an administration that is using all different types of powers that the federal [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=169.48s)]
*  government has to hit the pressure points of Harvard and to do it in a way that they [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=176.48s)]
*  certainly aren't doing to any other school or institution in the country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=183.84s)]
*  It has been a relentless attack in a way that certainly I didn't think an administration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=189.56s)]
*  was capable of pulling off. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=196.88s)]
*  And as someone who has covered retribution and Trump's use of his power against institutions [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=200.0s)]
*  and individuals, I've found it pretty remarkable. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=207.52s)]
*  It's so interesting that you mentioned retribution though, because I don't recall whether Harvard [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=210.96s)]
*  actually did anything to Trump. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=214.74s)]
*  When did this fight start? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=217.32s)]
*  So it all may have happened because of an accident. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=219.0s)]
*  Let me try and explain. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=224.8s)]
*  Please. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=226.88s)]
*  What happens is, is that after the Trump administration comes in, they start quietly in March having [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=227.88s)]
*  discussions with Harvard about ways that the administration would like Harvard to change [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=236.8s)]
*  how it operates, particularly around the issue of anti-Semitism. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=245.68s)]
*  There has been a range of reporting about how Jewish students at Harvard were subject [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  to harassment on campus by protesters in the aftermath of the October 7th attacks. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=260.52s)]
*  And this was an issue that the far right and Trump supporters and Trump himself have [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=269.28s)]
*  talked about at length. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=276.76s)]
*  So Harvard had been widely criticized for allowing anti-Semitism on campus. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=279.11999999999995s)]
*  What has also become clear over the last few months is that the concerns raised by the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=286.4s)]
*  administration are not just about anti-Semitism. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  Can you remind us, what else has the Trump administration taken issue with at Harvard? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=294.76s)]
*  The Trump administration had taken a position that the far right had taken on Harvard for [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=299.12s)]
*  a while, that they were concerned about how Harvard was proceeding with DEI policies and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=304.16s)]
*  using and considering issues like race in a range of different matters on campus. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=312.4s)]
*  To say it another way, it sounds like Harvard was one of the many institutions that the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=317.92s)]
*  Trump administration is concerned is, quote unquote, too woke. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=321.1s)]
*  Perfectly set. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=324.12s)]
*  So they're having this very constructive back and forth. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=329.92s)]
*  Harvard doesn't like us to call them negotiations. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=333.76s)]
*  They like to call them guy because they didn't want to be seen as sort of capitulating. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  So they're engaging this back and forth about what the administration would want Harvard [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=342.24s)]
*  to do. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=347.2s)]
*  And in the midst of this back and forth, Harvard's lawyers say to the administration, like, okay, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=348.72s)]
*  we have some idea of what you want, but give us some specifics. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=354.8s)]
*  Tell us what you actually want us to change. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=359.2s)]
*  They want a demand letter. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  So we can go back to the top officials at Harvard and say, look, here's what the administration [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  wants. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=368.12s)]
*  How can we make a deal to satisfy this? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=369.12s)]
*  Give us a letter that tells us exactly what you're looking for. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=372.88s)]
*  And these lawyers for the administration say, okay, we'll send you that letter on Friday. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  So Harvard is waiting for this letter from the administration. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=382.84s)]
*  And that Friday comes and it goes and no letter comes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=386.53999999999996s)]
*  And then in the middle of the night, Harvard receives a letter from the administration. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=390.82s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=398.23999999999995s)]
*  The letter is not just what the administration wants Harvard to do, but it's a series of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=403.28s)]
*  demands about how Harvard would operate that someone on the Harvard side told me essentially [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=410.0s)]
*  amounts to appointing Stephen Miller, the chancellor of Harvard. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=417.44s)]
*  What does that even mean? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=422.0s)]
*  It means that Harvard would have to give up an enormous amount of power to the Trump administration [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=423.04s)]
*  to allow it to see into its admissions, its hiring, what it teaches, the types of people [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  who teach it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=437.68s)]
*  The demands are extraordinary. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=439.42s)]
*  In other words, it sounds like this letter is demanding that the administration get a [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=445.5s)]
*  lot of control over things that are probably pretty core to the academic independence of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=449.78000000000003s)]
*  Harvard. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=454.62s)]
*  It would do more than just fly in the face of academic freedom. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=455.62s)]
*  It would have given the federal government an arm in Harvard's day to day operations [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=460.52000000000004s)]
*  that go far beyond anything we've seen at a private education university like Harvard. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=466.28s)]
*  So how does Harvard react to this? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=477.08s)]
*  So Harvard makes an extraordinary decision. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=479.08s)]
*  Over that weekend, they decide that the demands from the Trump administration are so great [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=483.0s)]
*  that they have no choice but to publicly rebuff this and take on Trump and stand up for themselves. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=489.12s)]
*  And just to remember what's happening at this moment, this is coming after Columbia basically [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  capitulated to similar list of demands that the administration was making in order to [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  provide that school with funding. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  So when you say that this was an extraordinary decision, you mean because like their response [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=510.12s)]
*  is so different from what we saw up until that point about how university presidents [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=515.62s)]
*  were dealing with the Trump administration, right? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=520.18s)]
*  And it's vastly different than a series of top law firms in the country who were also [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=523.62s)]
*  going in to the Oval Office to make deals with Trump to head off executive orders against [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=529.32s)]
*  them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=537.18s)]
*  So that Monday, without going back to the administration, Harvard puts out a letter [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=538.66s)]
*  that essentially says there is no way we are going along with any of this. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=545.62s)]
*  We are putting our foot down and we are going to do whatever we need to do to protect our [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=550.38s)]
*  independence. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=555.68s)]
*  Along with putting out their letter and a statement from Harvard's president, Harvard [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=557.52s)]
*  puts out a copy of the letter that the administration had sent them that Friday night. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=562.5s)]
*  So they really want people to see the demands for themselves. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=568.16s)]
*  They want the world to see. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=570.06s)]
*  Look at how crazy these demands are. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=572.66s)]
*  Look at this letter and you can see why we decided we had no choice but to fight. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=576.14s)]
*  And almost immediately after Harvard puts all of this out, Harvard's lawyers receive [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=582.34s)]
*  a frantic call from a lawyer in the Trump administration who they had been negotiating [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=588.28s)]
*  with. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=593.98s)]
*  What does he say? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=594.98s)]
*  He says, that letter that you guys got on Friday that now is like the center of the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=596.02s)]
*  whole issue for why Harvard has decided to take on the Trump administration, that letter [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=603.02s)]
*  wasn't supposed to be sent out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=608.02s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=609.82s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=613.54s)]
*  Do they believe that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=614.54s)]
*  It's one of the great mysteries of the Harvard story. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=615.54s)]
*  Did they mean to send the letter? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=619.94s)]
*  Was the wrong letter sent? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=621.9s)]
*  Was it sent at the wrong time? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=623.74s)]
*  Or did the administration overplay their hand? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=626.46s)]
*  Did they send a letter that they thought was negotiation but was just so extreme and so [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=630.02s)]
*  beyond the pale that Harvard thought they had no choice but to fight? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=637.1s)]
*  Did they call their bluff basically? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=641.3s)]
*  Correct. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=642.5s)]
*  It would be like if you and I were negotiating and you said to me, Mike, I'll give you 25 [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=643.5s)]
*  cents. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=650.34s)]
*  I said, what about 75 cents? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=651.58s)]
*  We're going back and forth in good faith. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=654.1800000000001s)]
*  Then all of a sudden I walk in and I'm like, give me $20. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=655.98s)]
*  You're like, what the heck, Mike? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=659.1s)]
*  You know I only have maybe 50 cents, 75 cents. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=661.34s)]
*  There's no way I could give you $20. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=665.94s)]
*  Sorry, there's no way I can make a deal with you if that's what you want. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=668.38s)]
*  That's sort of what happened here. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  You're basically saying that Harvard is looking at this demand letter being like, there's [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=674.98s)]
*  nothing to even negotiate with. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=677.38s)]
*  Correct. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=679.26s)]
*  But at that point, the war had already begun. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=680.26s)]
*  Harvard had already declared that it was going to rebuff Trump. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=683.74s)]
*  By the end of that day, the White House announces that Harvard will start to lose major portions [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=689.38s)]
*  of federal funding that it receives for research the school does. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=696.66s)]
*  Just days later, Harvard goes to court and sues the administration to get back the money [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=701.86s)]
*  Trump has stripped away from them for their refusal to go along with what he wants. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=707.7s)]
*  Tell us about the lawsuit and how exactly Harvard is fighting it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=712.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, Harvard goes to court with two of the top conservative lawyers in the country at [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=715.7s)]
*  the head of their legal team. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=722.3000000000001s)]
*  They had Robert Herr, who had been the special counsel who investigated whether Joe Biden [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=724.34s)]
*  had mishandled classified documents. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=730.22s)]
*  Is Robert Herr the one that called Biden an elderly man with a poor memory? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=733.02s)]
*  And then they had Bill Burke, who is a well-known lawyer in Trump's orbit, who even at the time [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=737.0600000000001s)]
*  was the outside ethics advisor to the Trump Organization. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=746.22s)]
*  So clearly they're trying to bring in people that would understand the administration and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=750.46s)]
*  have some good sense of how they're thinking. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=754.18s)]
*  People who could bridge the gap between what the administration wants and those that are [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=756.7s)]
*  targeted by it who could potentially make a deal. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=763.02s)]
*  So what is Harvard's legal argument exactly? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=766.74s)]
*  What Harvard's essentially saying is that you have unfairly taken away our money without [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=769.34s)]
*  any process, without even investigating us. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=774.74s)]
*  And you've done it in a way that actually violates our First Amendment rights because [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=778.6600000000001s)]
*  you're trying to infringe here on what happens inside of our classrooms. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=784.46s)]
*  And Harvard's also saying, look, if you're saying this about how anti-Semitism is on [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=790.7800000000001s)]
*  campus, what does funding for cancer research have to do with anti-Semitism? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=796.82s)]
*  And as this court case is proceeding, Harvard looks like it really has the wind at its back. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=803.74s)]
*  Legal experts are saying that they have a very valid case and could quickly win in court [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=815.1800000000001s)]
*  and get their money back. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=820.32s)]
*  Harvard is also being widely praised for its willingness to fight back. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  There's a feeling that not only is Harvard taking a stand, but Harvard has to take a [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=829.5200000000001s)]
*  stand because they are uniquely positioned to fight back. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=835.1600000000001s)]
*  They have an enormous amount of resources and abilities. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=840.72s)]
*  And if they're not going to fight back, then who is? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, as it appears like all the momentum is heading in Harvard's way, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=850.32s)]
*  I start to hear from folks that I'm talking to that Harvard's problems may be much bigger [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=859.7600000000001s)]
*  than just winning this legal case. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=868.1600000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=880.32s)]
*  Mike, you just told us that there's a feeling out there that Harvard is one of the best [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=889.96s)]
*  equipped institutions to fight the Trump administration. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=894.08s)]
*  But yet there are people inside Harvard that still feel like they have all of these problems [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=896.6s)]
*  no matter which way the lawsuit goes. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=900.84s)]
*  So what are those problems exactly? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=902.96s)]
*  What I was coming to understand was that the court case only related to funding that [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=906.12s)]
*  the Trump administration had already frozen, and that even if Harvard was to prevail in [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=912.04s)]
*  court, they would still need to get funding in the years that followed. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=919.48s)]
*  And if they remain persona non grata with the administration, how are they going to [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=925.5600000000001s)]
*  get future federal grants for their research? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=931.44s)]
*  So it showed that while the court case was important, there were other consequences to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=935.64s)]
*  being in such public opposition to the administration, which had the lever or the spigot of research [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=944.24s)]
*  money that was critical to the work that was going on at Harvard. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=953.76s)]
*  In other words, the court case does not guarantee that they're going to get access to future [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=958.64s)]
*  grants, future federal funds, etc. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=962.08s)]
*  How big of a deal is this money that we're talking about for a place as enormous as Harvard [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=965.68s)]
*  that also has tons of donors the way that other Ivy League schools do? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  So understanding Harvard's finances is probably like a Harvard class in and of itself. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=975.76s)]
*  The very least another episode of The Daily. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=982.4s)]
*  Boring one. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=985.04s)]
*  How dare you. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=986.04s)]
*  Basically, Harvard has, along with becoming a place that teaches and educates, has become [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=988.04s)]
*  a big research institution. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=997.76s)]
*  It does work on cancer. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1001.3199999999999s)]
*  It does work on things related to aerospace that I don't even know how to describe. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1003.56s)]
*  It does stuff on physics and math and all the important things that we think that academia [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1009.0799999999999s)]
*  does or is supposed to do to be at the cutting edge of making our society better. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  To do that work, Harvard has come to rely on grants and funding from the federal government [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1021.5200000000001s)]
*  that accounts for about half of their research budget. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1029.8s)]
*  And we're talking about billions of dollars, just to be clear, right? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1033.92s)]
*  Billions and billions of dollars. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1036.8400000000001s)]
*  Harvard though, don't they have other resources? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1040.52s)]
*  I mean, how screwed are they? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1043.24s)]
*  They can go out and raise hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1046.68s)]
*  But to come up with the whole from the federal government may even be too big for Harvard. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1052.12s)]
*  Because while they do have all of that money in the endowment, the endowment is not a slush [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1061.04s)]
*  fund or a rainy day fund or something they can easily tap into. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1067.2s)]
*  It's a more complicated thing than like, oh, wow, Harvard's got the biggest piggy bank [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1072.72s)]
*  in the country. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1076.36s)]
*  Why don't they just go break into it? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1077.36s)]
*  It's more complicated than that. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1078.72s)]
*  Have you heard examples already of, I'm just making this up, researchers who are say declining [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1084.0s)]
*  to go to Harvard because they're worried about their funding getting cut? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1091.0s)]
*  Yeah, and we've heard about how other universities are trying to appeal to these researchers [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1094.76s)]
*  to say, look, we don't have these major questions over us. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1101.6000000000001s)]
*  We've even heard of foreign countries like China trying to recruit some of these researchers. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1105.92s)]
*  Because while Harvard is held up as the most prestigious institution in the country, there [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1112.96s)]
*  are a lot of other universities in the country that can and do similar work and could facilitate [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1120.6s)]
*  that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1127.96s)]
*  Given the existential threats that the funding cuts could pose to Harvard, are they considering [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1128.96s)]
*  at all trying to reach some kind of deal with the administration despite the language that [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1135.32s)]
*  they put out about how they're going to fight? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1141.12s)]
*  As far as we know, the corporation, that board that oversees Harvard, has not authorized [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1144.08s)]
*  its lawyers to go back to the table to negotiate. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1151.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1155.48s)]
*  Because there's a feeling that how can you make a deal with Donald Trump? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1157.24s)]
*  Donald Trump has shown through the deals he made with the law firms that there's Donald [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  understanding of the deals and there's the law firms understanding of the deals. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1169.96s)]
*  There's a gap between those two. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1174.5600000000002s)]
*  You mean like one side thought they were getting something, but then it turned out they were [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1176.48s)]
*  getting something different? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1179.68s)]
*  Yeah, in the case of the law firms, they thought to head off these executive orders from Trump, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1180.68s)]
*  they were committing tens of millions of dollars in pro bono legal work to uncontroversial [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1186.44s)]
*  causes like helping veterans. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1191.6000000000001s)]
*  Then in the weeks after the deal, Trump started talking publicly about how these lawyers could [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1194.8799999999999s)]
*  go and do trade negotiations for the government and these lawyers could go and help the coal [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1201.76s)]
*  industry. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1206.2s)]
*  That's not what the firms thought that they agreed to. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1208.76s)]
*  There's this feeling of how can we go to the negotiating table with someone like that who [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1212.28s)]
*  could easily move the goalposts on us? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1217.12s)]
*  Harvard is also being lavished with praise. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1221.32s)]
*  Harvard has not always been an institution that looks favorably upon. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1224.68s)]
*  They themselves are coming out of scandal. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1231.3600000000001s)]
*  Right, of course there was quite notably the resignation of Claudine Gay, the first female [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1233.3200000000002s)]
*  black president of Harvard who resigned after only six months in the wake of plagiarism [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1237.6000000000001s)]
*  allegations and sort of disastrous congressional testimony over anti-Semitism. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1242.52s)]
*  The corporation, that board, was lambasted for giving in to the far right on that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1247.8s)]
*  In this instance, the corporation, which has some pretty prominent Democrats on it, is [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1254.32s)]
*  being held up as a central player of the second term resistance. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  They know the criticisms that the law firms have received for making deals with Trump. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1266.36s)]
*  They know if they go back to the table, that that's a pretty big step for them and something [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1273.1599999999999s)]
*  that they could really face a lot of blowback for. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1278.24s)]
*  It sounds like they're basically kind of stuck. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1280.76s)]
*  Correct. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1283.64s)]
*  And that was the sort of thing that I found most fascinating about the Harvard story, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1284.64s)]
*  which was that as they were being praised for fighting back and as everyone said, oh, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1289.0s)]
*  they've got this great legal case and they've got these great lawyers, that they were really [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1295.04s)]
*  in an increasingly difficult position and that there weren't great ways out for itself. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1299.52s)]
*  And in the midst of that, they have continued to be pelted by the administration. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1309.1599999999999s)]
*  In the weeks since the funding was first taken away, the administration has doubled down [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  on its funding cuts. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1325.28s)]
*  It's found new and different ways to strip Harvard of federal money. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1326.28s)]
*  It has made other threats and brought into question whether Harvard is going to be able [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1331.32s)]
*  to keep its tax exempt status with the IRS. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1336.48s)]
*  There's additional measures potentially in place to tax their endowment in a more severe [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1341.6s)]
*  way. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1349.8s)]
*  Harvard is also getting buried in requests and paperwork from a range of different Justice [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1351.28s)]
*  Department investigations, investigations by the Department of Education, Health and [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1356.6200000000001s)]
*  Human Services. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1361.26s)]
*  And there's this fear atop Harvard that with all these different investigations, which [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1363.26s)]
*  for now are civil, that they'll turn into full blown criminal investigations. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1369.02s)]
*  And on top of that, in perhaps one of the most severe things that we've seen, the administration [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1377.7s)]
*  demanded all of the information the school had on international students. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1383.98s)]
*  When Harvard didn't give the administration what it wanted, it said, we're taking away [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1390.1799999999998s)]
*  the visas for all of your international students, which is a potentially huge deal because international [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1395.8s)]
*  students make up a quarter of the student population at Harvard. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1404.1s)]
*  And they tend to pay full price. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1409.62s)]
*  Correct. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1411.58s)]
*  Harvard did quickly sue, they went to court over this, and got a judge to temporarily [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1413.38s)]
*  halt it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1420.94s)]
*  So it's been paused for now. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1422.54s)]
*  But now if you're an international student, you have to be checking the federal docket [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1424.98s)]
*  to see if there's an injunction in place that allows you to continue to go to school. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1429.18s)]
*  It also sort of feels like up until now, the cuts have been aimed at the funding. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1433.38s)]
*  But cutting off visas is really striking at the fabric of the student body and the identity [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1443.7s)]
*  of the school and the diversity of the school, things that go beyond just the tuition money [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1449.0200000000002s)]
*  that Harvard gets. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1453.9s)]
*  Correct. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1455.8200000000002s)]
*  Think about that, that the government, in one what appears to be fairly quick action, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1457.78s)]
*  was able to raise a question of whether a quarter of a student body was going to be [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1466.06s)]
*  able to attend school in the fall, even if a judge steps in and says it's no good. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1472.74s)]
*  That's a major use of the government's power. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1481.06s)]
*  What's the takeaway here? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1484.94s)]
*  You mentioned earlier that Harvard is one of the institutions that is arguably one of [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1486.58s)]
*  the best suited and most well-resourced to fight a broadside from the administration. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1490.6599999999999s)]
*  And so I just sort of wonder, especially for you, who's thinking about the retribution [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1495.54s)]
*  beat, for people that are looking at this fight, what is the takeaway for them? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1499.8999999999999s)]
*  Before Trump came back to office, I spent a lot of time trying to understand what retribution [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1506.86s)]
*  his first term and how he may use his power to his political ends when he came back to [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1513.26s)]
*  office. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1518.9399999999998s)]
*  The thing about Trump's attempts to use power in his first term is that while he does have [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1520.82s)]
*  some success, it's really success through blunt force. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1525.36s)]
*  He basically jumps up and down until his rivals are investigated and the government doesn't [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1529.0s)]
*  always do what he wants, even when he demands it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1535.1s)]
*  I often said to myself, I've never seen Trump do a three-point turn. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1540.3s)]
*  Everything he does is sort of through blunt force. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1544.44s)]
*  But in the second term, particularly through the law firms and through Harvard, we've seen [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1547.22s)]
*  a sophistication to his retribution that goes beyond certainly what I thought he was capable [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1553.16s)]
*  of. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1560.82s)]
*  Someone, somewhere in the administration has found the different pressure points that they [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1562.06s)]
*  can hit on Harvard. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1568.52s)]
*  Even if you have the best lawyers and the law on your side, any significant portion [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1575.0s)]
*  of the country behind you, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have success when you're [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1580.52s)]
*  fighting back against an administration that is audaciously using its power. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1586.04s)]
*  And if there is a victory for Harvard, it will not be a clean, clear-cut thing that [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1592.16s)]
*  is resolved in court. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1599.1200000000001s)]
*  It will be something that will have to play out over many years, over many different court [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1601.68s)]
*  cases, and will force Harvard to come up with money or cut back on its ambitions in ways [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1607.2s)]
*  that it didn't think it would ever have to. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1615.16s)]
*  Mike, thank you so much. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1622.16s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1626.3200000000002s)]
*  On Wednesday, Harvard University's Director of Immigration Services said in a court filing [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1632.16s)]
*  that efforts by the Trump administration to halt the school's ability to enroll international [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1637.7s)]
*  students has sown, quote, profound fear, concern, and confusion, and that countless international [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1642.1200000000001s)]
*  students have asked about transferring from Harvard. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1649.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1658.48s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1661.72s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday evening that the Trump administration would [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1664.16s)]
*  seek to revoke visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1668.6000000000001s)]
*  Party or studying in what he called critical fields. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1673.52s)]
*  Rubio also said the State Department would revise criteria for all future visa applications [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1677.84s)]
*  from China, including from Hong Kong. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1682.9599999999998s)]
*  And the United Nations denounced the new aid operation in southern Gaza a day after its [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  chaotic launch, which saw thousands of Palestinians rushing a food distribution site. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1692.36s)]
*  Israel had borrowed humanitarian aid from entering Gaza for more than two months. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1698.32s)]
*  And while shipments began entering the enclave last week, much of it has yet to reach many [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1703.24s)]
*  Gazans. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1707.6s)]
*  The UN criticism comes as allies, including the United States, are expressing frustration [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acVL-77zmWA&t=1708.6s)]
