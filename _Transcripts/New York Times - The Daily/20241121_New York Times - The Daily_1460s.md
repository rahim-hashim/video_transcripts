# The Murder of Laken Riley
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLdw_TmQbEA)
*  Hey, it's Michael. Just a quick note. Today's episode contains some graphic depictions of
*  violence.
*  May it please the court, counsel. On February 22nd, Jose Abara put on a black hat, a hoodie
*  style jacket, and some black kitchen style disposable gloves. And he went hunting for
*  females on the University of Georgia's campus. And in his hunt, he encountered 22 year old
*  Lakin Riley on her morning jog. And when Lakin Riley refused to be his rape victim, he bashed
*  her skull in with a rock repeatedly. That is what this case is all about.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  On Wednesday afternoon, inside a courtroom in Athens, Georgia, a guilty verdict was reached
*  in what prosecutors have described as a cut and dried case of cold blooded murder. But
*  that courtroom, the case has become something far bigger. Today, national reporter Rick
*  Rojas on how the death of Lakin Riley has become a flashpoint in the national debate
*  over border security, illegal immigration, and mass deportation. It's Thursday, November
*  21st. Rick, tell us about the woman at the center of this entire story, Lakin Riley.
*  So Lakin Riley is a 22 year old nursing student living in Athens, which is a bustling college
*  town here in Georgia. It's about an hour, hour and a half away from Atlanta. And she's
*  just leading a very kind of normal college life. She lives in a house close to the University
*  of Georgia campus with a group of roommates. They talk about each other like their family.
*  They have meals together. They have movie nights. They share each other's locations
*  from their phones so they can keep an eye on each other. And Lakin is an avid runner.
*  She regularly suits up and takes a long jog. And that's exactly what she did on the morning
*  of February 22nd. At about 9am, she heads out for a run. And then she heads into the
*  woods running on what is usually a very placid, peaceful, widely considered safe place. The
*  first sign of trouble comes about 10 minutes later. She activates the emergency function
*  on her iPhone and it calls 911. A dispatcher picks up the phone and keeps asking if anyone's
*  there, but the line is silent. For almost a minute, there's no response. And then you
*  hear a faint voice saying, yo Tango, or I have in Spanish. And then the call ends. After
*  about an hour from 9am to 10am and then to 11am, Lakin's roommates start to get worried
*  about her. Like, where is she? What happened? And so that's when they use the location sharing
*  function on the phone to try to track her down. It did not give a precise location,
*  but it gave them a rough sense of where she was. And in the course of looking for her,
*  one of her roommates actually finds one of her AirPods on the ground. And that's like
*  a very chilling sign that something's going on with Lakin. That's when they call in the
*  police. And so a campus police officer from the University of Georgia sets out looking
*  for her and they find her shortly after noon that day. Her body has been dragged about
*  60 feet from the trail. She's been covered with leaves. Her top has been lifted over
*  her head. She's bloodied, clearly beaten. And it's clear from that moment that there's
*  been a vicious attack that ended in Lakin Riley's death. So not long after Lakin's
*  body is discovered, investigators start finding all kinds of evidence. They find a bloody
*  jacket that's been thrown away in a dumpster. They find security camera footage showing
*  someone throwing that jacket away. They find her phone with a thumbprint on it. They find
*  DNA evidence under her fingernails that they believe shows who her attacker was. And they
*  quickly find and arrest her suspected killer. And as far as the authorities are concerned,
*  it's a pretty open and shut case. It's very straightforward who they believe did this
*  and that they have the evidence to back that up. As awful as this case is, as gruesome
*  as the details are, it's also not the sort of case that would necessarily rise to a national
*  news story until we find out who the police have arrested. What do you mean? So we quickly
*  learned that the suspect had come into the United States illegally. And suddenly this
*  is no longer simply a local murder case. It becomes something much bigger and it becomes
*  a political symbol. Which we're going to get to. But Rick, first tell us about this suspect
*  and how he ended up in these woods near the University of Georgia.
*  So Jose Antonio Ibarra is a 26 year old migrant from Venezuela who had this circuitous path
*  that led him to Athens, Georgia. He entered the United States illegally on the border
*  near El Paso, Texas in September of 2022. And he's arrested by immigration authorities.
*  And then he is released while his case is being reviewed. It's happening at a time
*  when the border and the Biden administration in particular has just been overwhelmed by
*  a surge in border crossings and particularly with migrants coming from Venezuela. Migrants
*  like Mr. Ibarra. So what happens to him once he's released into the United States? He heads
*  to New York City. First he goes to Queens. He stays at a Crown Plaza hotel there that
*  had been converted into a migrant shelter. And while he was in New York, in August of
*  2022, he was arrested for driving a scooter without a license with a child who was not
*  wearing a helmet. He was not prosecuted or jailed in that case. A few weeks later, he
*  goes to the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan, which had become the city's official welcome
*  center for migrants. And he goes through a process that's known as reticketing where
*  the city pays for migrants to move elsewhere. And so he gets a ticket to leave for Atlanta
*  on September 28th. And that's how he ends up in Athens in Georgia, where his brother
*  already is and has found work. So he briefly becomes part of this wave of migrants that
*  those of us who live in New York City remember really well. There are so many coming so quickly
*  that the city sets up a bunch of hotels and shelters to deal with them and ultimately
*  allows some, perhaps even encourages some, it sounds like including Ybarra, to leave
*  New York City and go someplace else to relieve the pressure on city resources.
*  Right. And so at that point, he moves to Athens and lives in an apartment complex that's just
*  a short walking distance from the University of Georgia campus that's home to working-class
*  immigrants who have ended up here in this Georgia city from all over the place, including
*  Asia and Latin America. And so then in October, just a few more weeks after he arrives in
*  Georgia, he and his brother are both arrested in connection with a shoplifting case at a
*  local Walmart. But he's not detained. The authorities run his name through state and
*  national databases at the time, but don't find any warrants for him. And so he's released.
*  So I just want to be sure I understand. At this point, he's been arrested three times.
*  First time when he enters the country unlawfully, but then he is released. A second time in
*  New York City for the scooter incident, now a third time for shoplifting. And at no point,
*  it sounds like is there any effort to detain him for some meaningful period or perhaps
*  deport him?
*  Right. And so because of all of this, his immigration status, his previous arrests,
*  his repeated releases, when he's arrested for murdering Laken Riley, the case just blows
*  up. You know, I said earlier, it became a political symbol. And remember the timing.
*  It's February and a presidential election year. This is Georgia, a swing state, and
*  illegal immigration is a huge priority for voters. Right. So Republicans all the way
*  up to Donald Trump decide that this is the case to focus on. This for them is the case
*  that encapsulates all the dangers of illegal migration. And they're going to talk about
*  it and talk about it and talk about it as much as humanly possible.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Rick, what exactly do Republicans do with this case back in February once Jose Ibarra
*  is arrested and his immigration status becomes widely understood?
*  They waste no time speaking out about it.
*  Our hearts are breaking this morning for the family of Laken Riley.
*  Just two days after Laken Riley is killed, Brian Kemp, Georgia's Republican governor,
*  sends a letter to President Biden demanding answers about Jose Ibarra's immigration status.
*  Biden's death is a direct result of failed policies on the federal level and an unwillingness
*  by this White House to secure the southern border.
*  And he even delivers a speech about it where he just rips into Biden.
*  And because of the White House's failures, every state is now a border state. And Laken
*  Riley's murder is just the latest proof of that.
*  And then two weeks later, Georgia Republicans bring the issue to President Biden even more
*  directly at his State of the Union address.
*  Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.
*  As President Biden enters the House of Representatives, he is confronted by Marjorie Taylor Greene,
*  a Republican representative from Georgia.
*  She's wearing a t-shirt that says, say her name.
*  She's wearing a pin with Laken Riley's face on it.
*  And then during the speech, my team began serious negotiations with the bipartisan as
*  President Biden starts to talk about legislative efforts to address immigration issues, Representative
*  Greene speaks up.
*  Not really.
*  She begins heckling President Biden during his address, goading him to say her name and
*  to directly address this case.
*  And so he does.
*  At least he attempts to.
*  Lincoln, Laken Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal.
*  In the process of trying to say her name, he mispronounces it, which is given more fodder
*  to conservatives.
*  But at the same time, he says that this is an innocent young woman who has been killed
*  by an illegal, a term that is deeply offensive to many people on the left and immigration
*  Advocates for immigrants who see this term as just dehumanizing and pejorative.
*  And so in a way he ends up just pleasing no one.
*  Right.
*  He just wades right into this mess and just makes it even worse.
*  In some ways, he just offends everyone across the board.
*  So by this point, the death of Laken Riley has gone national into the most watched presidential
*  speech of the year.
*  Where does it go from there?
*  That goes right to the center of President Trump's campaign this year.
*  From 2016 on, Trump has focused a lot of his attention on illegal immigration, and he's
*  tried to portray undocumented immigrants as violent and used a lot of incendiary language,
*  even playing on racial stereotypes and anxieties to try to describe the menace that he says
*  they have been to the country.
*  And now suddenly, as his campaign is heating up again, and he returns to this theme of
*  illegal immigration, he has a villain that he can point to as representative of everything
*  that he has been arguing for years.
*  Laken was a brilliant young student.
*  And so Trump and his allies just bring this case up exhaustively.
*  He was assaulted, beaten, and horrifically murdered by an illegal alien.
*  They bring it up in rallies.
*  They bring it up in advertisements and in conservative media.
*  Laken Riley should have been able to go on a run in broad daylight without being murdered
*  by an illegal immigrant.
*  All in an effort to paint this case as something widespread or common.
*  How many more killers has Biden set free?
*  In their view, it is representative of this bigger failure on the part of the Biden administration
*  to crack down on illegal immigration and to crack down on the southern border.
*  And they frame this case as just the tip of an iceberg.
*  Right.
*  And it felt like the Biden campaign was struggling when Biden was the nominee to respond to this
*  because this incident had occurred on his watch and there had been a meaningful rise
*  in illegal immigration when he was president.
*  But I want to just pause Rick and ask, based on your reporting, how representative what
*  Jose Ibarra is accused of doing here really is of undocumented immigrants?
*  According to Trump and Republicans, this is common.
*  This is a real threat.
*  What's the actual reality of it?
*  I mean, this is very clearly an aberration.
*  What Jose Ibarra is accused of doing is in no way reflective of the intentions or the
*  actions of the vast majority of the people who are undocumented and who enter the United
*  States.
*  The studies have repeatedly shown the opposite, that this is a population that is doing everything
*  they can to avoid detection, to keep their head down.
*  Their intention is not to come here and so unrest and to perpetrate violence.
*  It's really to get away from something else and seek economic opportunity.
*  And so while this case is very much real, it's not necessarily an indictment of undocumented
*  people more broadly.
*  But President Trump and other conservatives have highlighted this case because it so neatly
*  makes the point that they want to make, even if the evidence more broadly doesn't bear
*  this out.
*  Right.
*  Of course, for many Americans, one murder by somebody who is in the United States unlawfully
*  is going to be one murder to many.
*  But even if the end of Jose Ibarra's journey in the United States is rare, a violent act,
*  a murder, it feels like the rest of his journey feels much more common for somebody who comes
*  here illegally.
*  He enters the country, he's given taxpayer funded resources in multiple locations, and
*  he is not deported even when he does have encounters with law enforcement.
*  And that part of the story on its own for a lot of people is very problematic.
*  Yes.
*  One murder is too many for sure.
*  But I think, as you said, Ibarra's entire journey touches on many people's frustrations,
*  where the system is falling short, and how migrants in these situations are treated.
*  And I think there's this underlying sense of fairness that I think drives a lot of the
*  opposition.
*  Before the election, when I talked to voters, I heard about that, about the resources, about
*  the taxpayer dollars that have gone to supporting these migrants, that they're getting access
*  to support and a pathway to a secure place in this country that doesn't exist for other
*  people.
*  They look at Jose Ibarra and say, why did this person get a hotel room in New York City
*  paid for by the government?
*  Why was he flown to Georgia on the taxpayer's dime?
*  And whether you think this is a good use of money or not, those are the questions that
*  are being asked.
*  Why is someone who is here unlawfully getting something that US citizens aren't?
*  How does that make sense?
*  And then on top of all these questions of fairness, now you have this murder.
*  Right.
*  And after this presidential campaign from Donald Trump, in which he makes immigration
*  and at times this case, which he has invoked such a big part of his message, Trump wins
*  the election.
*  He wins Georgia, where this crime happened, among other swing states, and millions of
*  voters, tens of millions of voters effectively endorse his call for mass deportation on a
*  scale we have never seen before in the United States.
*  He's calling for millions of people to be deported.
*  And in his telling, somebody like Jose Ibarra is exactly who should be deported when that
*  mass deportation starts.
*  And then, as fate would have it, right after this election, in fact, I think just two weeks
*  after this election, this murder trial of Jose Ibarra begins in Athens, Georgia.
*  Right.
*  And the trial moves fast.
*  The defense was concerned about being able to find a jury in Athens, a city that was
*  just rattled by this killing, who could dispassionately hear the evidence and render a verdict.
*  So they ask for a bench trial instead, meaning it's the judge who decided whether or not
*  he was guilty.
*  And so after four days of testimony, the judge reaches his verdict and he delivers it just
*  15 minutes after the lawyers had finished their closing arguments.
*  He did not hesitate.
*  No.
*  He found him guilty.
*  And then later in the afternoon, he sentenced Ibarra to life in prison without the possibility
*  of parole.
*  And Rick, now that Jose Ibarra has been convicted and sentenced, how do we think that this case
*  will live on in a post-election world in which the president-elect, and soon to be inaugurated,
*  President Trump, is talking so much about illegal immigration and mass deportation?
*  I think he just a day or so ago mentioned a plan to invoke a national emergency and
*  use the military to carry out mass deportation.
*  What happens to this case, given how it has now been resolved in that context?
*  So this guilty verdict is already being embraced as validation by the people who have raised
*  the profile of this case from the very beginning.
*  The people who have wanted to focus on this case as a justification for cracking down
*  on illegal immigration.
*  Not long after the verdict on Wednesday, Trump came out and celebrated it and linked it to
*  his plan for deportation.
*  He said, it's time to secure our border and remove these criminals and thugs from our
*  country so nothing like this can happen again.
*  And so clearly this case is going to be a part of how this new administration makes
*  the case for mass deportation.
*  The outcome of this election and the outcome of this trial all but ensured that this case
*  is going to live on in some way for a very long time.
*  Well, Rick, thank you very much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday, the Republicans who controlled the House Ethics Committee blocked the release
*  of a report into allegations of sexual misconduct and drug use by former representative Matt
*  Gates, president-elect Trump's pick to be attorney general.
*  Senators from both parties have asked to see the report as they try to vet Gates.
*  But the Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a close Trump ally, has pressured the Ethics
*  Committee not to make the report's findings public.
*  And the Department of Justice is asking that Google be forced to sell its popular web browser,
*  Chrome.
*  The request was made to a federal judge who ruled back in August that Google has maintained
*  an illegal monopoly in online search.
*  If the judge accepts the plan, it could radically reshape Google's business.
