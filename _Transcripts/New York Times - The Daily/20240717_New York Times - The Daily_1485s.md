# Loving Their Pets to Debt
**New York Times - The Daily:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8)
*  Uh oh. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=0.0s)]
*  Clementine stop. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=3.88s)]
*  Oh my gosh, sorry. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=4.88s)]
*  She has thoughts. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=7.84s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavarisi and this is The Daily. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Over the past decade, the cost of veterinary care in the US has skyrocketed as healthcare [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=22.12s)]
*  for pets has come to look more like healthcare for people. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=27.98s)]
*  Today, my colleague Katie Thomas on how vet care became a multi-billion dollar industry [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=33.58s)]
*  and the fraught emotional and financial landscape it has created for pet owners. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=42.58s)]
*  It's Friday, July 12th. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=56.7s)]
*  Katie welcome to our Friday episode. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=74.18s)]
*  Yeah, I'm excited. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=76.10000000000001s)]
*  So Katie, you recently wrote about something that I as a pet owner and a lot of people [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=78.62s)]
*  this team, also pet owners, can relate to and that is that the cost of veterinary care [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=83.34s)]
*  has skyrocketed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=89.62s)]
*  Tell me how you came to this story. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple of years ago, my family and I, we got a new dog. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  We got a puppy and his name is Roscoe and he did great. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=98.54s)]
*  The first year, he was a very healthy little dog and then when he was about a year and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=102.86000000000001s)]
*  a half old, he got very sick and we learned that he had been born with a very serious [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=108.2s)]
*  liver defect and our vet referred us to a bigger animal hospital and that's kind of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  when I entered this world, that's like a new level of veterinary care that I hadn't realized [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=121.72s)]
*  existed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=127.44s)]
*  So as I was navigating this, I was wearing two hats. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=128.8s)]
*  You know, one was just as a pet owner and trying to figure out the right treatment for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  my dog and then the other hat I was wearing is as the health care reporter, which is my [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=136.76s)]
*  full-time job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=141.44s)]
*  So I kept on noticing a lot of aspects of the veterinary world that to me were starting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=142.72s)]
*  to feel very, very similar to the human health care world that I cover and as I started looking [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=149.36s)]
*  into this, I started learning just how much money there is now in the veterinary industry [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=157.16s)]
*  and also how expensive this care has become over the last couple of decades. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=163.92s)]
*  I learned that very quickly these bills can start adding up to five, ten, even fifteen [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=170.32s)]
*  thousand dollars. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=176.04s)]
*  And how much have prices actually increased? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=178.16s)]
*  I mean, it seems to me like a huge amount, but what are the numbers there? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=180.92s)]
*  So as we know, prices for all kinds of things are going up because we've seen inflation [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  over the last couple of years, but vet care prices have risen much faster than the overall [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=190.72s)]
*  rate of inflation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=195.16s)]
*  My colleagues and I actually ran the numbers and in the last decade, the price of services [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=196.8s)]
*  has risen about 30 percent. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=201.16s)]
*  And in that same period, veterinary care has gone up by more than 60 percent. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=203.88s)]
*  Why is that, Katie? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=208.72s)]
*  I mean, that's the question here, right? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=210.28s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=211.92s)]
*  So when I started reporting this out, I found that there were a number of factors that were [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=213.2s)]
*  contributing and they're all intertwined. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=217.84s)]
*  One is just that the culture of owning a pet has changed. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=221.36s)]
*  More and more people are owning pets and there's different surveys, but anywhere between like [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=225.4s)]
*  60 to 70 percent of American households have a pet. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  And as those of us who do have pets know, we kind of see them more and more as members [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=235.04s)]
*  of the family. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=239.96s)]
*  You know, I mean, one example is like dogs used to live outside, right, or sleep in a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=240.96s)]
*  garage or something. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=244.88s)]
*  And now there's this one survey that I found that almost half of Americans sleep with their [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  pet. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=250.95999999999998s)]
*  I would never do that, Katie. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=251.95999999999998s)]
*  No, none of us would. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  And we just need to walk into any pet store to see how much money people are spending [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  on pets for cute outfits, birthday cookies. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=262.36s)]
*  When you go away, you don't just leave them in a kennel, but they're now dog hotels. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  There's this fancy one near me where they have a view of the Chicago River. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=273.24s)]
*  You know, you can pay extra for a river view. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=277.92s)]
*  OK, I would never leave my dog in a dog hotel, though I did just send her to a boarding place [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=280.24s)]
*  where she got a bunch of training when I was on vacation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=285.4s)]
*  So I am feeling a little sheepish here, but it has gone crazy. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=287.68s)]
*  I mean, we were talking to the team earlier and I was saying I was overhearing someone [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=291.76s)]
*  on the street just walking, talking to their friend, having a conversation about dropping [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=296.8s)]
*  her off at daycare. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=300.88s)]
*  And I couldn't tell whether she was talking about a dog or a child. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=301.88s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=305.6s)]
*  OK, so we are all pet owners now, or at least a majority of us are. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  So that bigger demand for services presumably causes prices to rise. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=312.0s)]
*  Is that what's going on here? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=317.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a part of it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=319.16s)]
*  But the big driver is also that there's just been these remarkable advances in medicine [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=320.32s)]
*  for animals. And it's kind of like what I saw with my own puppy. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=325.16s)]
*  Historically, vets would help with really kind of basic things like a cut on a paw or [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=328.91999999999996s)]
*  deworming or spaying and neutering. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=335.67999999999995s)]
*  But for anything life threatening like cancer or something like that, really the only option [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=337.76s)]
*  that they had available to them was to put the animals to sleep and to give them a humane [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=343.08s)]
*  death. But over the last decade, there's just been huge leaps in what we can do for our [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=347.79999999999995s)]
*  pets. There's been big steps in cancer care. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=354.55999999999995s)]
*  Very intricate and involved surgery, dermatology. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=358.56s)]
*  There's been some really big new drugs for dogs in particular to help with skin allergies. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  There's physical therapy. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  There's just so many options now available to pet owners to help their animals live [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=370.44s)]
*  longer and better lives. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  Like, for example, I spoke to this one vet who she's been working since the 1990s, and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  she told me this story about how her father was a human doctor. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=385.44s)]
*  And back then, what she would do is she had a lot of dachshunds and dachshunds often have [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=389.68s)]
*  bad backs. And she would sneak them into the human hospital after hours and into the MRI [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  machine so she could check them out. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=402.32s)]
*  And today, she has an MRI machine. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=404.4s)]
*  And, you know, many animal hospitals have MRI machines for animals. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=407.32s)]
*  So that's really a measure of how things have changed even since the 1990s. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=412.64s)]
*  Yeah. And it's pretty amazing and great that we have these options available for our pets. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=417.04s)]
*  But it also costs a lot of money to do all of this new stuff, which brings me to another [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=422.36s)]
*  big change that I found in my reporting, which is this has become very appealing to big [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=427.96s)]
*  businesses because just remember, historically, veterinary offices were small businesses [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=434.0s)]
*  and they were staffed by animal lovers, not business people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=440.76s)]
*  And that has made it an enticing target for investors because they see an opportunity [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=444.64s)]
*  there. OK, so big business spots an opportunity here. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=449.71999999999997s)]
*  So what happens? So basically, big companies and private equity firms start buying up [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=453.44s)]
*  small chains and individual clinics. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=461.44s)]
*  They pretty much go on an acquisition spree. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=464.8s)]
*  One big example is the conglomerate Mars, which is probably best known for selling candy [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=467.4s)]
*  and also pet food. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=473.64s)]
*  Little known fact, Mars is also a big dog food manufacturer, not just a candy bar maker. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=474.96s)]
*  Yes, it makes a lot of different dog foods. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=479.72s)]
*  And it's been in the pet world for a long time. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=481.64s)]
*  But over the last several years, they've also bought up the big veterinary chain, VCA. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=484.64s)]
*  They also own Banfield, which is in a lot of the PetSmartz, which is a big pet store [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=490.52s)]
*  chain. They also own a specialty hospital chain called Blue Pearl. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=496.4s)]
*  And then in addition to that, a lot of private equity backed firms have been buying small [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=501.64s)]
*  individual practices. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=507.64s)]
*  That trend really peaked in twenty twenty one, for example. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=509.56s)]
*  And so the situation that we have today is that a quarter of all primary care vet clinics [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=513.92s)]
*  are now owned by corporations and three quarters of specialty hospitals are owned by [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=520.0s)]
*  companies. And Katie, how does this consolidation, you know, in some cases, three quarters [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=525.76s)]
*  of all clinics owned by big companies, how does that affect these high prices we've been [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=530.52s)]
*  talking about? Well, I spoke to a number of vets who have worked in these corporate owned [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=535.36s)]
*  clinics. And what they told me is that they are under increasing pressure to do things [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  that basically drive up the cost of care for pet owners. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=547.76s)]
*  Some examples that they gave me is they felt increasingly stressed and pressured to see [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  more animals per day. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=557.04s)]
*  Others told me, you know, to a certain extent, veterinarians have always had some of their [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  pay tied to how much revenue they bring into the practice. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=563.4399999999999s)]
*  But at these corporate owned clinics, the pressure is even greater. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=566.92s)]
*  They were being asked to order more tests or one veterinarian that I spoke to said, you [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=571.16s)]
*  know, that she was told she needs to get her cost per client higher or someone else said [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=577.4s)]
*  that someone needed training on getting a pet owner to yes. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=582.4s)]
*  You know, these are high pressure sales tactics that, you know, you really don't expect to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=586.84s)]
*  see in a vet office. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=591.84s)]
*  And some of these vets that I spoke to said that they felt pretty uncomfortable with that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=593.6s)]
*  as well. So now there's this doubt, right? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=598.52s)]
*  It's like, is my vet recommending this thing because my dog should have this thing or is [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=601.0s)]
*  my vet recommending this thing because he needs to make a different bottom line than he used [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=605.64s)]
*  to? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=609.96s)]
*  Right. And, you know, when I spoke to vets, they were very clear that they only provide [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=610.52s)]
*  the care that they think is best for that particular animal. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=615.6s)]
*  But there's no denying that these incentives and pressures are there. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=619.24s)]
*  And they say that there's a lot of factors that pet owners don't always appreciate. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=623.64s)]
*  One of them is they are very forward, public facing, kind of almost like a retail store. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=628.76s)]
*  They get Google reviews, Yelp reviews. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=634.4s)]
*  And so they're very worried about not providing the top level care and perhaps getting [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=637.4s)]
*  inviscidated in reviews. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=643.8s)]
*  And so sometimes that can put pressure on them to make sure that they've done absolutely [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=645.56s)]
*  everything they can for an animal. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=650.0s)]
*  The last thing is that a lot of veterinarians do still own their own clinics. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=652.56s)]
*  And they told me that they're facing all of the same rising costs and pressures that any [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=657.4399999999999s)]
*  other small business owner is facing. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=663.76s)]
*  And that includes paying a living wage for workers in a pretty tight labor market, the [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=666.04s)]
*  rising costs of prescription drugs and lab tests and other equipment. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  And they say that a lot of times pet owners just see the high price tag and they blame [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=676.24s)]
*  the person in front of them, which is the veterinarian. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=682.08s)]
*  OK, so the rise of this corporate consolidation we've been seeing has meant perhaps higher [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=685.52s)]
*  prices and has put more pressure on vets. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  But are there any upsides in it for us, for consumers? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=694.88s)]
*  I mean, just one example from my old neighborhood in Washington, D.C., there was a new chain [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=698.68s)]
*  that moved in that was 24 hours and that was a great option for my very accident prone [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  dog. She suddenly had a couple of different options of places that we could go in the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=709.76s)]
*  middle of the night if something happened. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=713.4s)]
*  For sure. I mean, anytime there's more money available, you can invest in the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=715.6s)]
*  better services, nicer offices, nicer waiting rooms. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=721.1999999999999s)]
*  There's more money for better equipment and investing in some of these specialty services [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=725.36s)]
*  that we've been talking about. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=731.0799999999999s)]
*  So there are definitely benefits to this. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=733.4s)]
*  But as I found in my reporting, even as vet care has really caught up in a lot of ways [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=737.8399999999999s)]
*  to human health care, there's a lot of important ways that they're different. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=745.04s)]
*  And that can present some really difficult choices and some prickly moral choices for [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=752.16s)]
*  pet owners. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=759.36s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=763.88s)]
*  So, Katie, let's dig into the ways that pet care is actually different from human care, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=771.4399999999999s)]
*  you know, setting aside the fact that pets are not people. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=776.04s)]
*  So talk to me about what these main differences are. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=779.32s)]
*  The biggest difference is how the pet care gets paid for. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=783.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone in the U.S. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=788.1600000000001s)]
*  would say that health care is particularly affordable. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=790.0s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is that most people do have health insurance that covers the [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=793.32s)]
*  bulk of their medical costs. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=798.2800000000001s)]
*  And if you are in an emergency situation, hospitals are legally obligated to give you [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=800.4000000000001s)]
*  life saving care and then sort out the bills later. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=807.04s)]
*  But that's just not how things work in the vet world. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=810.52s)]
*  Veterinarians don't have the same obligation to treat. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=814.04s)]
*  And so it's almost entirely on the pet owner to pay the full amount of the bill, basically [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=817.52s)]
*  up front and at the time of service out of pocket. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=823.5999999999999s)]
*  So that is a big difference. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=827.36s)]
*  But isn't there pet insurance as well? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=829.92s)]
*  There is pet insurance, but a very small minority of pet owners actually have pet [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=832.8000000000001s)]
*  insurance, just about 4 percent. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's very different from the health insurance that most of us are familiar with. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=841.6s)]
*  You know, some examples are that with very few exceptions, you still have to front the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=848.36s)]
*  money for the bill and then you would submit that claim to your pet insurance, which will [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  then decide whether that's a legitimate claim and then they will reimburse you. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  Generally, plans don't cover pre-existing conditions. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=863.7199999999999s)]
*  They charge more for pets that are older. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=867.3199999999999s)]
*  It's kind of like the pre-Obama care version of human health care. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  Many things that are now not allowed in the human health care world are still very much [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=875.0799999999999s)]
*  a feature of how pet insurance works. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=880.16s)]
*  And even if you have pet insurance, that doesn't always mean that you can keep it. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=882.76s)]
*  To take one example nationwide, which is one of the biggest providers of pet insurance [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=887.32s)]
*  in this country, recently said that the cost of pet care is getting so expensive that it [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=892.72s)]
*  had to discontinue the plans of 100,000 pet owners. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=899.0s)]
*  And so that left a lot of these pet owners basically back where they had started with [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=902.76s)]
*  having to cover the cost of the care themselves. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's, of course, presuming they can pay. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=911.2s)]
*  Right. I mean, I'm sure for a lot of people, their devotion to their area is very [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  animal notwithstanding. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=916.72s)]
*  It's just not possible to drop a few thousand dollars on these amazing life saving [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=918.12s)]
*  treatments. So are those people who can't afford that just having to put their pets [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=922.6s)]
*  down? What are those people doing? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=927.52s)]
*  And this is where this just gets extremely thorny and difficult. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=929.76s)]
*  I think there's a number of different answers. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=934.6s)]
*  Yes, I think some people do have to put their animals to sleep or choose less expensive [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=936.32s)]
*  options. But when I talk to pet owners about this, many of them, when they're [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  going to pretty extreme lengths in order to cover this care and to find a way to pay [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=946.72s)]
*  for it. You know, I spoke to people who dipped into their retirement funds. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=951.28s)]
*  I spoke to somebody who donated blood plasma, someone else who took on a second job [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=955.12s)]
*  in order to pay for this. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=960.64s)]
*  And many people also charge it on a regular credit card like a visa and then pay it off. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=962.1600000000001s)]
*  But another option that a lot of pet owners end up going for is something called a [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=969.0s)]
*  medical credit card. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=975.88s)]
*  And what exactly is that? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=976.96s)]
*  It's a specialty credit card that's offered at a lot of these veterinary clinics. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=978.52s)]
*  It's right there on the counter often. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=982.96s)]
*  And the way that these cards generally work is that there is an introductory period, say [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=985.08s)]
*  six months. And if you pay that off within that period, you don't have to pay any [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  interest at all. But if you don't pay it off and you still have some debt at the end [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=995.84s)]
*  of that, the interest rate can be pretty serious. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1001.64s)]
*  Like how much? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1004.92s)]
*  Well, I spoke to this one pet owner, her name's Heather Massey, and she shared her bills [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1006.0s)]
*  with me and she's paying 30 percent. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  Wow. So that's high. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1014.88s)]
*  Yes, it is high. But you can also see why it's tempting. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1016.28s)]
*  You're really struggling to figure out how you can pay off this pretty significant [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1019.64s)]
*  bill. And then, you know, this is an available option to you. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1024.4s)]
*  And, you know, many people think that, hey, I could think I can do that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1028.16s)]
*  I could pay off that during, you know, that six months or something like that. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1031.28s)]
*  But Heather is not alone. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1035.96s)]
*  I spoke to the company that she got her card through, Care Credit, and they told me that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1038.16s)]
*  80 percent of people who take out the card pay it off in time. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  But put another way, that means one in five people who take it out don't pay it off [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1048.2s)]
*  within the introductory period. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1052.76s)]
*  So a lot of people going into debt for their pets. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1054.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1059.08s)]
*  And can I just pause for a moment on that, Katie? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are dogs and cats, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1063.0s)]
*  These are not our children. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1066.4399999999998s)]
*  And yet we're going into debt like this, trying to prolong their pretty short [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1068.96s)]
*  lives. Like, you know, it does seem kind of nuts in a way. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1074.1599999999999s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, I'm imagining myself in that vet office staring at the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1079.48s)]
*  bill and staring at a very sick Clementine. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1084.56s)]
*  And I think I would have a really hard time not doing that myself, not taking on [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1087.6s)]
*  that debt. I can easily imagine myself doing it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1092.96s)]
*  It's hard. Yeah, it's really hard. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1095.8s)]
*  And I think we're we're in a whole new world right now. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1098.36s)]
*  You know, the vets that I spoke to used to say that really the only option for a [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1102.56s)]
*  very sick animal was euthanasia. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1108.6s)]
*  And now they're going into these exam rooms and offering pet owners so many other [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1111.4s)]
*  options to prolong the life of their dogs and cats. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1118.0s)]
*  But, you know, regardless of what options these pet owners choose, what's happening [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1122.52s)]
*  is that they're the ones who end up in the driver's seat. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1128.52s)]
*  The decision ultimately sits with them. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1131.32s)]
*  And they're now faced with this whole new set of ethical questions. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1135.32s)]
*  And big financial responsibilities that they really never had before. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1139.96s)]
*  Right. Like when there's always another treatment to try and there's a credit card [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1145.3200000000002s)]
*  to put it on, you know, it feels to the pet owner like it's their choice about [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1149.4s)]
*  whether their pet lives or dies. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1154.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. And the question comes up just because you can. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1157.48s)]
*  Does that mean you should? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1161.2s)]
*  And is that always in the best interest of the pet? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1163.0s)]
*  It's actually the question that I wrestled with my own puppy. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1168.16s)]
*  He got very sick. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1173.16s)]
*  It turned out he had a very serious health problem. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1174.8400000000001s)]
*  And so in our case, we learned that there was a surgery that could fix it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1179.48s)]
*  Pretty expensive surgery, but we decided to go for it because he was young and had [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1185.68s)]
*  potentially a long dog's life ahead of him. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1191.76s)]
*  Unfortunately, he experienced complications from the surgery and he didn't actually make it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1197.68s)]
*  Oh. But, you know, I don't regret having done it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1203.92s)]
*  And he got really great care. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1208.88s)]
*  My experience just really echoed what I heard from so many pet owners and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1215.0800000000002s)]
*  veterinarians that there's really no easy answers to these very new questions that [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1220.6s)]
*  we're all facing. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1227.9199999999998s)]
*  You kind of have to sort out the risks and rewards of pet ownership. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1230.04s)]
*  And in my case, I decided it was worth it to me. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1237.7199999999998s)]
*  And I recently got a new dog. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1245.8799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, here we go again. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1248.64s)]
*  Katie, thank you. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1257.72s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1266.4s)]
*  Here's what else you should know today. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1278.2s)]
*  On Thursday night, amid growing doubts about his age and mental fitness, President Biden [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1280.1200000000001s)]
*  wrapped up a summit of NATO leaders in Washington. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1286.44s)]
*  And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine who has as much courage as he has [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1290.0800000000002s)]
*  determination, ladies and gentlemen, President Putin. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1296.0s)]
*  By mistakenly introducing the president of Ukraine as the president of Russia. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1298.92s)]
*  He's a big president Putin, President Zelensky. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1307.68s)]
*  Later. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1311.76s)]
*  With that, I'll take your questions. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1312.68s)]
*  I've been given a list of people to call on here. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1315.3200000000002s)]
*  Biden held a news conference that was widely seen as a crucial test of his stamina and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1319.16s)]
*  coherence. In his first answer, he once again stumbled when referring to his own [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1324.3600000000001s)]
*  vice president. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1330.0s)]
*  Look, I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1331.4s)]
*  But I think she was not qualified to be president. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1336.24s)]
*  So let's start there. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1338.76s)]
*  But over the next hour, Biden spoke with fluency and command about the war in Gaza, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1340.28s)]
*  America's policy toward China and his relationship with Russian President Vladimir [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1346.1599999999999s)]
*  Putin. And when pressed on his age and ability to serve a second term, Biden said he had [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1351.72s)]
*  no reservations. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1358.6s)]
*  Every single day I'm surrounded by good docs. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1360.48s)]
*  If they think there's a problem, I promise you, or even if they don't think it's a [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1363.4s)]
*  problem, they think I should have a neurological exam again, I'll do it. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1368.0800000000002s)]
*  No one's suggesting that to me now. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1372.4s)]
*  Still, when the news conference was over, three more House Democrats called on Biden [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1374.72s)]
*  to step aside as nominee. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1380.24s)]
*  As of Thursday night, 18 congressional Democrats have asked Biden to end his [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1382.8000000000002s)]
*  campaign. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1388.4s)]
*  A quick reminder to catch a new episode of the interview right here tomorrow. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1392.88s)]
*  This week, Lulu Garcia Navarro talks with Robert Putnam, the author of Bowling Alone. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1402.4s)]
*  For decades, he's been warning about the decline of American community and what that [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1409.44s)]
*  means for our democracy. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1414.5600000000002s)]
*  We're not going to fix all these problems in America. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1416.5200000000002s)]
*  Polarization, inequality, social isolation until we start feeling we have an obligation [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1419.56s)]
*  to care for other people. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1426.0s)]
*  And that's not easy. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1428.2s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Olivia Natt, Claire Tenesketter and Ricky Nowitzki. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1432.88s)]
*  It was edited by Lexi Diao and Devin Taylor with research help from Susan Lee, contains [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1439.4s)]
*  original music by Dan Powell and Rowan Niemesto and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljY-X71s7R8&t=1446.64s)]
