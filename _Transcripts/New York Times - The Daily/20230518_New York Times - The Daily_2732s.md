# An Anonymous #MeToo Source Goes Public
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m16NXq_0W-A)
*  Are you worried about repercussions coming from this interview today?
*  Oh, I am terrified. Absolutely terrified. Not necessarily that individual people will
*  be upset with me, but I'm very, very, very worried about the law firm continuing to come
*  after me because it's one thing to take your licks, accept your punishment, and disappear,
*  and it's entirely another thing to come back and stand up and talk about it.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  It's been more than five years since the Me Too movement changed the world,
*  toppling powerful and abusive men. That moment was driven by reporting at places like the New
*  York Times. Behind these stories were sources, many of whom were anonymous,
*  who took enormous risks to expose wrongdoing and harassment and sexual violence.
*  Today, the key anonymous source behind a major story is disclosing her identity for the first
*  time. My colleague Rachel Abrams is going to tell her story.
*  It's Thursday, May 18th.
*  Allie Dirks has described herself to me as a quote, unremarkable person. Allie grew up in a small town
*  in Indiana with a Midwestern aversion to acting big headed. When you talk to her, she frequently
*  apologizes for things before she even says them or declares what she's about to say cringe worthy.
*  It can sometimes feel like she's afraid of taking up too much room in the world.
*  So it makes sense that when Allie was graduating from law school and lots of her friends were
*  trying to get fancy jobs at high powered corporate law firms, Allie decided she wasn't going to do
*  that. She just didn't feel like those jobs were for her. Yeah, I'm like cringing at my own thought
*  process. I just, I never thought any of that was accessible to me. I don't have the kind of prestige
*  and pedigree that are required. I could make myself miserable trying to compete for a spot
*  in a stratum where I don't belong or I can try to find something that makes me happy
*  that maybe has less earning power and less prestige, but you know, maybe where I might fit in.
*  Allie bounced around a bit, temping for various law firms, working in an unglamorous part of the
*  legal world that non-lawyers probably haven't heard of. It's called document review.
*  Doc review as it's colloquially known. It's grunt work. It's very unprostigious. A lot of quote
*  unquote real attorneys make fun of it because it's just such low status work. Essentially, doc review
*  is where lower ranking lawyers dig through piles of documents and evidence, flagging things that
*  are deemed important enough for higher ranking lawyers to read. By the time Allie was in her
*  early thirties, she was ready for something new. I was primarily just really in a, in a state of
*  yearning, a state of anticipation, state of wanting, desperately wanting to plant roots and
*  feel like I was on firm ground. And then in 2018, Allie landed a job at exactly the kind of firm
*  she thought she could never work in. A big top tier law firm named Covington and Burling.
*  She would still be doing doc review, but it felt like a huge step up. I was just very poised for
*  some sort of watershed moment in my career that would mean I've finally arrived. A watershed
*  moment arrived faster than Allie might've expected. Right after she started at Covington, she got word
*  she'd been assigned to a new case, a major one. As I recall, it was really just delivered as
*  we've got the CBS internal investigation. I don't know if you've heard about the stuff that's in the
*  news, but that's us. That's our case. This investigation, the case Covington assigned
*  Allie to, it had to do with Les Moonves, the former chief executive of CBS. Some of you might
*  remember this Les Moonves situation, but just to quickly lay out what this investigation was,
*  Les Moonves was a living legend of American television. He was known for green lighting
*  hits like Survivor, ER, CSI, and Friends. He was so known for picking hits, people called him
*  the man with the golden gut. But in the summer and fall of 2018, the New Yorker published allegations
*  from a dozen women who accused Moonves of sexual misconduct. The claims were numerous, intimidation,
*  harassment, and sexual assault. Moonves denied the allegations, but left CBS anyway in September
*  2018, making him one of the most powerful men to lose his job during Me Too. The network hired
*  Covington and another law firm to investigate the allegations and the culture at the company. One
*  big thing hanging in the balance was a $120 million severance package, and the investigation would
*  determine whether he should have been allowed to resign and take all that money, or whether CBS
*  might retroactively fire him for cause instead, in which case he'd lose that golden parachute.
*  This would easily be the biggest, highest profile case Allie had ever worked on.
*  LES LUNES MESSAGE Oh, this makes me cringe in retrospect, but I was really excited that it
*  was such a big deal. That something I did, moving around stacks of paper and reading through endless
*  emails, might manifest in some way in the real world. And the reason I guess I feel like it's
*  crass or tacky is that's just that's not a great or noble motivation to want to be involved in
*  something because it's in the news. But I guess it's just my invisibility and the precarity of
*  the kind of work that I was doing in DocReview was just it ground me down so much that one of
*  the most prestigious firms in the country, not only that, not only having a stable job, finally,
*  not only being assigned to a big deal investigation, but the work that we do might
*  end up being something that my friends and family can read about. I might not appear anywhere in the
*  credits, so to speak, but I worked on this. I was part of it.
*  LES LUNES MESSAGE At Covington, Allie was one of about 35 people to review thousands of documents,
*  emails, memos, letters, company files. She says many of them were mundane, innocuous,
*  totally boring detritus of office work. But very soon, Allie began to see evidence of abusive
*  behavior by Les Moonvesse. And what's more, she saw that through all of it, he had enjoyed loyalty
*  and support in the upper echelons of CBS. Allie had been excited by this case, in part because it
*  was a chance to be part of something big, the moment of Me Too. But like all of us, Allie could
*  look around and see lawyers falling onto different sides of what was unfolding. Week after week,
*  there were attorneys on the news, standing in front of victims, calling for justice for their
*  clients. But there were also other attorneys standing in front of the accused abusers, also
*  calling for justice for their clients. Allie's big new job left her strangely in the middle of this
*  us and them situation. On one hand, she could think of herself as an investigator, digging into
*  allegations of sexual misconduct, seeking accountability. But on the other hand, she was
*  working for Covington, who was working for CBS. Allie knew from years of document review that no
*  matter how much damning evidence she flagged, she would have no control over what CBS ultimately did
*  with it. They might act on it and make it public, or they could very well keep it under wraps and try
*  to minimize damage by burying it. For Allie, in this moment of reckoning, it became hard to tell
*  which side she was working for. Then Allie was riding the train home from work one day,
*  and she read something that struck exactly that nerve. I think I was riding the metro,
*  reading the Times on my phone. It was a New York Times article about the Moon Vest investigation.
*  In the story, people were casting doubts about Covington and CBS. A number said they weren't
*  cooperating with the investigation because they didn't trust CBS or Covington and its lawyers.
*  Lawyers like Allie. Allie was like, hey, I'm here. I'm trying to do good.
*  I remember it calling into question the integrity of the investigation or the people
*  doing it. And I thought, you know what, that's really unfair. Everyone that I'm surrounded by
*  every day is working really hard to get to the truth. Nobody talks about covering anything up.
*  Everybody cares about me too and doing the right thing. You know, it's not fair to just assume that
*  because people are in a big law firm that they don't care about doing what's right. And I felt
*  weirdly defensive of the process. And then Allie did something impulsive that would change the
*  course of the rest of her life and the lives of many others. She looked up the email for sending
*  tips to the New York Times. I brought a copy of what you wrote. Can you read it for us? Sure.
*  Oh man. I'm a staff attorney at Covington and Burling working on the CBS Moonves investigation.
*  There are around 35 of us doing document review for the case. It makes me sad every time I read
*  in the press that people don't trust the independence of the investigation. At the same time,
*  just because document reviewers find the truth doesn't necessarily guarantee the higher-ups
*  will use it for good and staff attorneys aren't privy to any of their decision making.
*  But I do trust the partners' integrity and independence, irrespective of whatever conflict
*  of interest people think they see. While I've only been on the case a few weeks, I can say every
*  report about CBS's toxic work environment is true, especially at 60 minutes. Obviously,
*  I must request anonymity because both my job and my law license are at risk. But this case enrages
*  me so much and it breaks my heart to look behind the curtain and see the ugliness and moral
*  bankruptcy of institutions and people I admired since childhood. Please let me know if I can be
*  of assistance to the Times. Ali's email landed in a general email address for tips that anyone can
*  write to. An editor sent it to me. Me, because it was my story that Ali read on the train that day.
*  It was me for whom Ali would eventually become an essential source.
*  I can't stress enough how unusual Ali's email was. It's almost unheard of to get an email out of the
*  blue from someone offering help with the exact thing we were investigating. And on top of that,
*  for it to be a lawyer who has access to sensitive details that are usually under the lock and key of
*  attorney-client privilege, it wasn't clear what Ali was offering exactly or what she wanted. But
*  it seemed certain that Ali would be in an incredible position to share inside information
*  if she decided to. Do you remember where our first meeting? I'm actually trying to remember
*  this myself. We met at a bar. We met at a bar. That's right. We met at a bar and we ordered
*  every fried thing on the menu. Yes. Ali and I first met at a bar in DC in the fall of 2018.
*  She had dark hair and was wearing a fire engine red coat so I could spot her easily.
*  She didn't seem like she'd ever met with a reporter before, certainly not under these
*  circumstances. Oh my gosh, it was a huge rush. I don't particularly like
*  admitting that or like that I felt that way because it seems a little, I don't know,
*  childish or silly. But it felt like being in a movie. I don't know if I recognized this at the
*  time, but I was really excited that an important person was paying attention to me and listening
*  to what I had to say and that something I did might manifest itself in the national paper of
*  record. That carried me a lot more than logic did at first. Ali's motivations at this point,
*  they've always felt complicated and not totally clear. Even Ali would tell you that they were
*  messy. I think one part of her was trying to figure out the right thing to do and to do that.
*  Another part of her felt swept up in the moment of me too. She was also, and this seems like a key
*  factor, someone who was used to feeling kind of powerless and she was also yearning to be part of
*  something that felt important. The longer we sat at our bar stools, the more you could see her
*  excitement overtaking any ambivalence she had. She started showing me handwritten notes and a
*  timeline, juicy details from inside the investigation. We talked for hours. One specific
*  thing I told her was that we were especially interested in this tip my colleague James Stewart
*  had gotten. According to that tip, Moonves had not been ousted because of the allegations in the New
*  Yorker, but because of something to do with another woman whose accusations against Moonves
*  weren't yet public. Moonves was apparently trying very hard to keep this woman quiet.
*  Her name was Bobby Phillips. Allie told me she thought she'd seen some materials about Phillips
*  and said she'd be in touch. We wrapped things up and left.
*  I hadn't even gotten on my train back to New York when Allie started sending me information about
*  text messages, conversations she'd read between Les Moonves and Bobby Phillips's longtime manager,
*  a man named Marv Dower. The two men were clearly talking about some kind of incident that had
*  happened with Phillips and seemed to be conspiring to keep her quiet. Allie was disgusted.
*  So what happened was this talent manager, Marv Dower, he'd set up a meeting between Bobby
*  Phillips and Les Moonves back in the 1990s. Dower didn't know what exactly had happened during that
*  meeting, but he suspected it was something very bad because Phillips was so upset afterward.
*  In this text conversation, he dangles his knowledge of that incident over Moonves's head,
*  pressuring the executive to get Phillips a job on a CBS show and implying that if he doesn't,
*  she might talk to reporters. Even though Dower didn't know the specifics at the time,
*  we would later report on how Phillips alleged that Moonves had sexually assaulted her during
*  that meeting. She alleged that Moonves told her, be my girlfriend and I'll put you on any show,
*  then grabbed her by the neck, pushed her to her knees and forced his penis into her mouth.
*  Phillips said it was traumatizing. She started having anxiety attacks before auditions
*  and wouldn't take meetings alone with male executives. She said once at a movie screening,
*  she was so scared of seeing Moonves that she vomited in an alley outside the theater.
*  Her career never took off. It really bothered me that the subject of this was someone who didn't
*  go on to become a headlining marquee actress. It was someone who had made a career out of small
*  parts, didn't have blockbuster fame, and her career was in the hands of these two men.
*  But these two men had a lot of control over Bobby Phillips' career and I saw
*  how that had played out so far. Like, why her?
*  These text messages had enormous stakes in the CBS investigation, beyond the alleged sexual assault.
*  They show that Moonves was potentially compromised as the head of CBS,
*  seemingly making decisions not based on the best interests of the company,
*  but his concerns about his own reputation. The messages also meant that the very first
*  night Allie and I met, she'd handed us the key to a huge story. And this was just the start.
*  In the coming days and weeks, Allie's uncertainty continued to fade as she saw more and more things
*  from the investigation that troubled her and cemented her belief that talking to me was the
*  right thing to do. Many of the things Allie was seeing were more glimpses of Moonves's
*  misconduct. But there were also pieces of evidence that fed her concerns about what CBS was going to
*  do with what the investigation found. Part of what we reviewed was HR reports where they would
*  track, you know, different things that were going on. And if there were complaints or
*  investigations happening, those would also be logged. Allie remembers seeing internal CBS
*  documents that tracked all kinds of allegations of misconduct throughout the whole company,
*  including what had been done about those claims or not done. The ways in which things weren't
*  followed up on or were brushed aside was really upsetting. And, you know, HR is supposed to be the
*  backstop against that kind of thing. And if they're not taking it seriously, then I don't know how
*  anyone else is supposed to. So just seeing how those workplace investigations that should have
*  taken care of the problem and held people accountable, that those workplace investigations
*  were either not being done at all, not being followed up on, or it was a very
*  cursory, like, we'll do this to check the box. That was really upsetting.
*  Put together, these materials gave Allie the impression that CBS could have taken such
*  allegations more seriously. And she wondered if the company would take Covington's investigation
*  seriously. Soon, Allie was sharing information from documents like these, as well as from texts,
*  memos, emails, and depositions from key witnesses. What has always struck me about Allie's story is
*  how much it clashes with a stereotype of a whistleblower. I think we have a tendency to
*  think about whistleblowers as acting from a place of clarity and conviction. What Allie did was very
*  different. Her motivations were kind of a mixed bag. She was conflicted. She took a messy first
*  step because she had a gut feeling and felt swept up by the moment she was in.
*  And ultimately, she charged ahead without a full appreciation of how much it would cost her in the end.
*  We'll be right back.
*  The first story, based significantly on materials that Allie Dirks leaked to the New York Times,
*  ran on November 28, 2018, about a month after Allie had first reached out to us.
*  The headline was, If Bobby Talks, I'm Finished, How Les Moonves Tried to Silence an Accuser.
*  The article description began, A trove of text messages details a plan by Mr. Moonves
*  and a faded Hollywood manager to bury a sexual assault allegation.
*  Actress Bobby Phillips breaking her silence about an alleged sexual assault at the hands of former
*  CBS chairman Les Moonves more than two decades ago. In a new report from the New York Times,
*  Phillips recalls a 1995 incident that she says took place during a meeting in Moonves's office.
*  The new revelations about Moonves and Phillips immediately put a spotlight on Moonves's massive
*  exit package and arguably made it look a lot worse for CBS to just hand him $120 million.
*  If Bobby Talks, I'm Finished. Five words, if true, could cost former CBS CEO Les Moonves
*  as much as $120 million.
*  Allie, of course, had to watch all of this from a very strange secret perch.
*  And I think that as I sort of watched reactions to it, both, you know, in the news and even on
*  social media, I was really interested in seeing what people said about it or in the comments.
*  Oh my God, I poured over the comments on the Times website because I wanted to see if this affected
*  anybody, if anybody thought, well, good, that sleazebag is getting what's coming to him,
*  or if people thought, how is this possible? How could someone do this and leak this information?
*  I wanted to know the effect it was having on other people, but I couldn't talk about it.
*  I remember you sent me in a text message a fist bump emoji, and it said,
*  long live the fourth estate. I mean, was it hard to keep this to yourself?
*  Oh, it's so, it makes me want to cringe at myself. It was incredibly hard. It was really,
*  really bad for my mental health in no small part because most of my closest friends are
*  people I went to law school with and lawyers, and I didn't think they would celebrate me
*  for this. That absolutely tore me apart trying to reconcile those things.
*  Nowhere was Allie's secret more isolating than at work at Covington, where day after day,
*  she was now showing up to live a high stakes double life. Allie was spending her days puzzling
*  out what information she might share with us and how, sometimes sneaking out to the lobby to send
*  messages. She kept her distance from coworkers, didn't friend anyone on Facebook, didn't give
*  anyone her phone number. I mean, I have distinct memories of walking through the lobby to get to
*  the elevator and seeing people I worked with, or even just making myself tea from the communal
*  office coffee station and feeling like, oh my God, these people have no idea what I'm doing.
*  I'm drinking their tea and eating their snacks and sabotaging all of this at the same time.
*  Like how am I still existing in the same space where I'm doing all of these things? But that
*  would occur to me in flashes. And for the most part, I had to stuff that down in order to keep
*  functioning. And I'm just sort of wondering, were you thinking like I am violating
*  attorney-client privilege or was it something else that was just like really eating at you?
*  I think first and foremost, it was the attorney-client privilege thing because
*  what I did was wrong. It was against the rules. There was no nuance to it. There's no way around
*  the bare fact that I violated a sacrosanct bedrock principle of the profession that I spent
*  years in school and went into debt for. Also, on a less noble level, I think anyone who's a
*  high achiever and a people pleaser or who grew up that way could maybe empathize. Just
*  the feeling of having people be mad at me and I'm in trouble, I'm going to get in trouble.
*  It's like a childlike feeling, a childlike concern almost. In the pit of my stomach,
*  it was people more important than me are going to be very, very mad at me and they're going to want
*  to punish me. New York Times reporter Rachel Abrams says she reviewed a 59-page draft report
*  prepared by lawyers hired by CBS that found Leslie Moonves deliberately lied about and
*  minimized the extent of his sexual misconduct. About a week after we ran our story about Bobby
*  Phillips, we published another story based on new information Allie was leaking to us. In this case,
*  Allie allowed me to see a draft of Covington's final report from the Moonves investigation.
*  The Times says the report shows Moonves allegedly deleted text messages, instructed at least one
*  person not to speak to investigators, and even handed over his son's iPad to investigators instead
*  of his own. The report read like a distillation of all the things Allie was disturbed by, Moonves'
*  misconduct and how CBS handled it. We ended up writing several stories about it and gradually
*  it turned up the pressure on CBS over the Moonves situation. Well, CBS says former chairman and CEO
*  Leslie Moonves will not get the 120 million dollar severance payment his contract called for. CBS
*  moved to deny Moonves his 120 million dollar golden parachute saying its outside investigation
*  concluded he violated company policies, breached his contract, and failed to cooperate fully.
*  The fallout from what Allie did was both sweeping and complicated. In the end, CBS decided it had
*  caused a fire on Moonves, denying him his enormous 120 million dollar severance.
*  In a twist though, Covington reportedly had to pay undisclosed settlements because of the leaks,
*  both to Bobby Phillips and to Leslie Moonves himself. Moonves made a statement at the time
*  that he would donate the money to charity. But it's worth noting it was not just Moonves that
*  Allie helped expose. There were also other problems at CBS. The information Allie shared from the
*  report included details about secret multi-million dollar settlements that had been paid over the
*  years to women who said they suffered sexual harassment, assault, or wrongful termination
*  by other men. Men who didn't lose their jobs and instead went right on working for the network.
*  In total, these stories offered everyone an unprecedented look at how a corporation
*  handled crises like these behind closed doors. And we never would have gotten that without Allie.
*  Part of all this that was not in the stories we ran, and hasn't been since until now,
*  is the story of what happened next for Allie. After we started publishing stories, Covington knew
*  almost right away it had a leaker and the firm started hunting for who it was. An email went out
*  that, according to Allie, said they were aware someone was sharing information with the press
*  and they were handling it. Then Allie started noticing some serious faced meetings in conference
*  rooms. But the first sign of real trouble for Allie was when one day she sat down at her computer
*  to start work. It seemed like Allie's access to the case files had suddenly been cut off.
*  She wondered if this was happening to everyone around her. But she also worried this might be
*  a sign that Covington was on to her. Remember, it wasn't just Allie's job that was in jeopardy,
*  but her entire career as an attorney. Then, in the coming days, more drives got cut off,
*  and Allie got more and more scared.
*  I mean, I was supposed to either quit my job if I feel that morally compromised by what I'm doing,
*  or what the firm culture would have taught me to do, I guess, is to, you know, go confess and try
*  to help them repair the damage. When did you know that, like, you specifically were in trouble?
*  It was right before Christmas, right before the holiday break, when they had started
*  pulling individual people out of the staff attorney room and walking them over to the main
*  building to be questioned. You know, once it was my turn, I knew I was sunk.
*  Allie says late on a Thursday afternoon, 430, she got called in for questioning.
*  Now, this I documented fairly carefully in notes to myself, because I thought if I needed to come
*  back to it, that I wanted to have clear memories. On Thursday, December the 20th, so almost the end
*  of the workday, I was walked over to the main office.
*  Allie's notes covered two interrogation sessions with Covington. The first one, Allie says, lasted
*  two hours. She says the lawyers questioning her didn't accuse her directly of being the leaker,
*  but showed her documents hoping she'd fess up. Things escalated in the second interrogation.
*  Allie says there were two attorneys from Covington, a man and a woman, and then also an outside lawyer
*  they'd brought in. This time, they explicitly accused Allie of leaking information.
*  They sort of circled me like they were pack hunting or something, and just making their points and
*  setting up the logical conclusion, and then they were going to either pounce on me or get me to
*  admit it. And I lied to them. I straight out lied. I denied communicating with you and denied having
*  done any of this. This went on for a while. The more Allie denied things, the more
*  intense the attorneys got. At one point, one of the Covington lawyers got so mad he had to leave
*  the room. The outside counsel told Allie he'd been losing sleep wondering how such a young,
*  promising attorney could do something like this. The other lawyer from Covington even started crying.
*  I wrote this down specifically that she had said, it's not frustrating, it's heartbreaking.
*  Help us explain this, disconfirm our suspicions, and on and on. And she had tried to do a sort of
*  female solidarity thing, like, you know, this is going to hurt the movement. You're harming other
*  women by doing this. After several hours of this, the Covington team wasn't budging, but neither was
*  Allie, and it all ended in kind of a stalemate. This is not an admirable way to feel, but on one
*  hand, I was really proud of myself for maintaining my composure to the point that it irritated these
*  people who do litigation for a living. They're supposed to be able to badger witnesses, but they
*  didn't break me. Eventually, they told Allie she could go. Allie took the elevators down,
*  and just a few months after she'd started, she walked out of Covington's building for the last time.
*  In terms of what ultimately blew Allie's cover, things got complicated between the two of us.
*  She thinks the Covington lawyers made it seem like a very small detail in one of our stories.
*  The number of pages in that draft report is what ultimately got her caught. She's pretty sure she
*  asked us not to include that detail, but neither of us can remember her saying that explicitly.
*  I've gone back and reviewed all of our messages repeatedly. The only message I can find about the
*  page number is me asking Allie if it's right and her simply confirming it. Also, in retrospect,
*  Allie feels like she would have been caught regardless. All of her activity on that shared
*  drive was traceable, so the firm could see everything she accessed. Every document, file,
*  text message, meaning that she was essentially leaving footprints in the snow, and it was only
*  a matter of time before Covington caught up to her. Covington, for the record, declined to speak
*  to us for this story, and the truth is, without Covington telling us how Allie got caught,
*  we still don't know and maybe never will. I can say nothing like this has ever happened to me with
*  a source other than Allie. Obviously, I feel awful about all of it.
*  This interview, the one you're hearing today, is the first time I heard many of the details of what
*  happened to Allie, in part because a lawyer who represented her through all of this advised her
*  not to speak to me anymore. And so, we fell out of touch until somewhat recently. But essentially,
*  what happened to Allie after the CBS investigation was a slow-motion disintegration of her life.
*  The life she had, and the promise of the life she thought she might have when she landed the job at
*  Covington in Berlin. After she was found out, Allie was placed on leave, and Allie, figuring she was
*  going to get fired, resigned. Following that, Covington filed a complaint with the DC Bar,
*  which in turn suspended Allie's law license, cutting off her ability to work as a lawyer.
*  Technically, the suspension was for a year and a half. Allie's husband Lee has urged her to get
*  it reinstated. But at least for Allie, it's never felt like something she could come back from.
*  I don't think I'll ever get my law license back. Way back when all of this started,
*  disciplinary counsel told me, I have a very clear memory that Covington is going to fight tooth and
*  nail if and when you apply for readmission. They will fight you every step of the way to make sure
*  that you don't get your law license back. How do you feel about the prospect of not getting it back?
*  I mean, in some ways, it can't get any worse than it is. I mean, I've had to seek out work that,
*  you know, some of which requires only a high school degree, for God's sake. I've had to do
*  things that were, I hate saying this, but I've had to do work that's so beneath my skill set,
*  beneath my education, to survive. And I don't, it doesn't really get much worse than that.
*  Allie swayed from job to job. At one point, she took a job for an arts organization,
*  making $12 an hour. When COVID hit and schools were scrambling for teachers,
*  Allie started substitute teaching. But that was unreliable. Throughout all of this,
*  Allie didn't have a wide circle of support, in part because she was so
*  reluctant to tell people what she'd done. I was just absolutely consumed by shame. My
*  parents thought I had just thrown away my career for nothing. They just said, you know, this was
*  such a stupid thing to do. How could you do this? How could you throw away your career? The concept
*  that there was any greater good being served was, was just not, it did not register with them.
*  What about Lee? What kind of conversations are you having with Lee at this point?
*  On some level, in order to keep going and getting out of bed every day, we'd sort of put this to the
*  side. But there were multiple, multiple conversations that ended with me just collapsed onto his lap,
*  just sobbing hysterically so that I couldn't even form words. He was the only,
*  the only receptacle for all that pain and all that shame. It frustrated him a lot that the shame part
*  of it was so bad for me. He, he really felt like I should have had more of a sense of righteous
*  indignation because he always believed from the get-go that, okay, this is right and you believe
*  in it. That's what it is. This is a me too issue and bad people are doing bad things.
*  He wanted me to be roaring and ferocious. This is what I did. I'm not afraid of you.
*  I mean, I think maybe a braver person would say, come get me. You know, if you're really
*  want to come after the person who stepped forward, like go for it. But that's,
*  that's not who I am. And that's not how I feel.
*  Lyle says she's been through several hard years since all of this and Lee's support never wavered.
*  That was true even as they drained Lee's retirement account to make ends meet,
*  to pay Ali's law school bills, which of course kept coming, or the mortgage for their house,
*  which Ali, who's been in and out of work has worried frequently about losing.
*  Ali still remembers the day when she was stressed and worrying to Lee about the possibility they
*  might lose their home. Lee replied, I'll build you a house with my own two hands if I have to.
*  In the last year or so, Ali's finally found steady work as an on-call court reporter.
*  In some ways, it's nice. She gets to use her legal background,
*  but in another way, it's also a bit of a constant reminder of the future she gave up.
*  In the last five years, people have done a lot of analyzing of Me Too. What it changed,
*  what it didn't, what was the backlash. A lot of it feels academic and abstract.
*  Ali's story stands out, I think, because it's such a concrete example of a trade-off.
*  She gave up so much, so concretely. In her story, there's such a plain version of the question,
*  was it worth it? How are you feeling about your decision to talk to me at this point when
*  your life is basically falling apart? It's strange because I never felt like if I could go back and
*  do it differently, I wouldn't talk to Rachel. I never had that thought. It's a very weird
*  emotional space to be in of not necessarily regretting or wanting to take back the things
*  I did and the decisions that I made, but also going through staggering amounts of suffering
*  for the things that I did. Because normally, in any other context, if that had happened in my life,
*  I would say, absolutely, I wish I could take that back. I'd take it back in a heartbeat, but
*  I was never able to settle into that posture, I guess.
*  I feel so bad about what happened to you, of course. You went through this horrific,
*  probably traumatizing experience, and I feel terrible about that.
*  But like you, I'm not sure what I'd go back and do differently, and I wonder how you feel hearing that.
*  I mean, I knew that you felt bad for me, and I guessed that it was probably really hard for you.
*  Lee didn't want to hear that. And it was also hard for him to accept because
*  our career trajectories were thrown in diametrically opposed orbits by the same
*  thing, the same catalyzing event. A scoop like this is going to make your career and
*  ruin mine at the same time. And Lee harbored a lot of anger about that, and I didn't.
*  Yeah, somehow I knew that it was eating at you.
*  It's never been lost on me what Allie said about how her decision sent our lives in
*  opposite directions. She lost her career and struggled in isolation.
*  I got a bigger profile and ended up with a book deal. I did ask, especially given what she'd lost,
*  if Allie felt like the change that Me Too produced was what she'd hoped it would.
*  She said, flatly, no.
*  No. I mean, I hope that that is not a finished, closed matter. I hope it's still viewed by
*  everyone as an open item and an ongoing conversation.
*  Allie's main feeling was that she'd seen a lot of individual men toppled,
*  but she had not seen the kind of societal change she hoped might come.
*  You know, Harvey Weinstein goes to jail, Dragon Slade, bad guy imprisoned, and that doesn't do it for me.
*  As for why Allie is choosing to tell her story publicly now, after all these years,
*  and to take the criticism and risks that come with that, Allie says mostly she just doesn't want to live with the secret anymore.
*  She knows that some listeners will consider what she did an unjustifiable act of betrayal to her colleagues and to her profession.
*  They might consider it proof that she should never have been a lawyer in the first place,
*  and maybe that she should not be allowed to work as one again.
*  Even Allie will tell you she'd never advise any other lawyer to do what she did,
*  because if everyone felt like they could just break the rules if they didn't like the client,
*  our entire legal system would fall apart.
*  At the same time, Allie also knows there will be people who sympathize with her,
*  that she had a very difficult decision between following those rules and following what she thought was the right thing to do.
*  Allie feels all of those things too.
*  Five years later, she still sees her decision as a complicated one, an imperfect one,
*  one that other people might make too.

*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  I feel very strongly as governor, but also just as a dad of a six- to five- and a three-year-old,
*  that we need to let our kids just be kids.
*  On Wednesday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a set of socially conservative bills
*  that ban gender transition care for minors, prevent children from attending live drag shows,
*  and restrict the use of preferred pronouns in schools.
*  What we've said in Florida is we are going to remain a refuge of sanity and a citadel of normalcy,
*  and kids should have an upbringing that reflects that.
*  The bills are widely viewed as laying the groundwork for a DeSantis presidential campaign.
*  Meanwhile, in Texas, the state legislature passed a bill
*  banning gender transition medical care for minors.
*  Texas would become the largest state to ban the treatment.
*  The bill was championed by Republican Governor Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it into law soon.
*  And in a dire warning on Wednesday, forecasters at the World Meteorological Organization
*  predicted that the next five years would likely be the hottest in recorded history,
*  driven by human-caused warming and a climate pattern known as El Nino.
*  That prediction is especially alarming because even small increases in warming
*  can increase the dangers from heat waves, wildfires, and droughts.
