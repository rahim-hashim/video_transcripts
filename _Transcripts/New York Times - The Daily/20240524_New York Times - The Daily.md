# Whales Have an Alphabet
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW4Olr0PUcA)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today, ever since the discovery that whales produce songs, scientists have been trying
*  to find a way to decipher their lyrics.
*  After 60 years, they may have finally done it.
*  My colleague, Carl Zimmer, explains.
*  It's Friday, May 24th.
*  Hi, Carl.
*  Hello.
*  I have to say, after many years of working with you on everything from the pandemic to
*  CRISPR, CRISPR DNA technology, that it turns out your interests are even more
*  varied than I had thought, and they include whales.
*  They do indeed.
*  And why?
*  What is it about the whale that captures your imagination?
*  I don't think I've ever met anybody who is not fascinated by whales.
*  I mean, these are mammals like us, and they're swimming around in the water.
*  They have brains that are much bigger than ours.
*  They can live maybe 200 years.
*  These are incredible animals and animals that we still don't really understand.
*  Right.
*  Well, it is this majestic creature that brings us together today, Carl, because you have
*  been reporting on a big breakthrough in our understanding of how it is that whales communicate.
*  But I think in order for that breakthrough to make sense, I think we're going to have
*  to start with what we have known up until now about how whales interact.
*  So tell us about that.
*  Well, people knew that whales and dolphins traveled together in groups.
*  But up until the 1960s, we didn't really know that whales actually made any sounds at all.
*  It was actually sort of an accident that we came across it.
*  The American military was developing sophisticated microphones to put underwater.
*  They wanted to listen for Russian submarines.
*  Naturally.
*  As one does.
*  But there was an engineer in Bermuda, and he started hearing some weird stuff.
*  And he wondered maybe if he was actually listening to whales.
*  Made him wonder if it was whales, of all things.
*  Well, the sound did not sound like something geological.
*  It didn't sound like some underwater landslide or something like that.
*  This sounded like a living animal making some kind of call.
*  It has these incredible deep tones that rise up into these strange, almost falsetto type notes.
*  It was incredibly loud.
*  And so it would have to be some really big animal.
*  And so with humpback whales swimming around Bermuda, this engineer thought, well, maybe
*  these are humpback whales.
*  And so he gets in touch with a husband and wife team of whale biologists, Roger and
*  Katie Payne, and plays these recordings to them.
*  And they're pretty convinced that they're hearing whales too.
*  And then they go on to go out and confirm that by putting microphones in the water,
*  chasing after groups of whales and confirming, yes, indeed, that these sounds are coming
*  from these humpback whales.
*  So once these scientists confirm in their minds that these are the sounds of a whale,
*  what happens with this discovery?
*  Well, Roger and Katie Payne and their colleagues are astonished that this species of whale
*  is swimming around singing all the time for hours on end.
*  And it's so inspirational to them that they actually helped to produce a record that they
*  released, the song of the humpback whale in 1970.
*  And so this is being sold in record stores, you know, along with Jimi Hendrix and Rolling
*  Stones.
*  And it is a huge hit.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  It sells like 2 million copies.
*  Wow.
*  Well, at the time, it was a huge cultural event, this record.
*  This became almost like an anthem of the environmental movement.
*  And it led for whales in particular to a lot of protections for them, because now people
*  could appreciate that whales were a lot more marvelous and mysterious than they may be
*  appreciated before.
*  And so you have legislation like the Marine Mammal Act.
*  The United States just agrees just to stop killing whales.
*  It stops its whaling industry.
*  And so you could argue that the discovery of these whale songs in Bermuda led to at
*  least some species of whales escaping extinction.
*  Well, beyond the cultural impact of this discovery, which is quite meaningful, I wonder whether
*  scientists and marine biologists are figuring out what these whale songs are actually communicating.
*  So the pains create a whole branch of science, the study of whale songs.
*  It turns out that pretty much every species of whale that we know of sings in some way
*  or another.
*  And it turns out that within a species, different groups of whales in different parts of the
*  world may sing with a different dialect.
*  But the big question of what these whales are singing, what do these songs mean, that
*  remains elusive into the 21st century.
*  And things don't really change until scientists decide to take a new look at the problem in
*  a new way.
*  And what is that new way?
*  So in 2020, a group of whale biologists, including Roger Payne, come together with computer scientists
*  from MIT.
*  Instead of humpback whales, which were the whales where whale songs are first discovered,
*  these scientists decide to study sperm whales in the Caribbean.
*  And humpback whales and sperm whales have very, very different songs.
*  So if you're used to humpback whales with their crazy high and low singing voices,
*  those bestselling sounds, those rockin' tunes of the humpback whales, that's not what sperm
*  whales do.
*  Sperm whales have a totally different way of communicating with each other.
*  I actually have some recordings that were provided by the scientists who have been doing
*  this research.
*  And so we can take a listen to some of them.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It's like a rhythmic clicking.
*  These are a group of sperm whales swimming together, communicating.
*  So whale biologists knew already that there was some structure to this sound.
*  Those clicks that you hear, they come in little pulses.
*  And each of those pulses is known as a coda.
*  And whale biologists had given names to these different codas.
*  So for example, they call one coda 1 plus 1 plus 3, which is basically click, click,
*  click, click, click, or 4 plus 3, where you have four clicks in a row and a pause and
*  then three clicks in a row.
*  Right.
*  And the question would seem to be, is this decipherable communication or is this just
*  whale gibberish?
*  Well, this is where the computer scientists were able to come in and to help out.
*  The whale biologists who were listening to the codas from the sperm whales in the Caribbean,
*  they had identified about 21 types.
*  And then that seemed to be about it.
*  But then an MIT computer science graduate student named Pratyusha Sharma was given the
*  job of listening to them again.
*  And what does she hear?
*  In a way, it's not so much what she heard, but what she saw.
*  When scientists record whale songs, you can look at it kind of like if you're looking
*  at an audio recording of your podcast, you will see the little squiggles of your voice.
*  Right.
*  And so whale biologists would just look at that ticker of whale songs going across the
*  screen and try to compare them.
*  And Sharma said, I don't like this.
*  This is not how I look at data.
*  And so what she decided to do is she decided to kind of just visualize the data differently.
*  And essentially, she just kind of flipped these images on their side and saw something
*  totally new.
*  And what she saw was that sperm whales were singing a whole bunch of things that nobody
*  had actually been hearing.
*  One thing that she discovered was that you could have a whale that was producing a coda
*  over and over and over again, but it was actually playing with it.
*  It was actually stretching out the coda.
*  So it would get a little bit longer, a little bit longer, a little bit longer, and then
*  get shorter and shorter and shorter again.
*  They could play with their codas in a way that nobody knew before.
*  And she also started to see that a whale might throw in an extra click at the end of a coda.
*  So it would be repeating a coda over and over again, and then boom, add an extra one right
*  at the end.
*  What they would call an ornamentation.
*  So now you have yet another signal that these whales are using.
*  And if we just look at what the sperm whales are capable of producing in terms of different
*  codas, we go from just 21 types that they had found in the Caribbean before to 156.
*  So what the scientists are saying is that what we might be looking at is what they call
*  a sperm whale phonetic alphabet.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, that's a pretty big deal because the only species that we know of for sure that
*  has a phonetic alphabet is us.
*  Is us.
*  Exactly.
*  So the reason that we can use language is because we can make a huge range of sounds
*  by just doing little things with our mouths.
*  A little change in our lips can change up b to a d.
*  And so we are able to produce a set of phonetic sounds and we put those sounds together to
*  make words.
*  So now we have sperm whales which have at least 150 of these different versions of sounds
*  that they make just by making little adjustments to the existing way that they make sounds.
*  And so you can make a chart of their phonetic alphabet just like you make a chart of the
*  human phonetic alphabet.
*  So then that raises the question.
*  Do they combine their phonetic alphabet into words?
*  Do they combine their words into sentences?
*  In other words, do sperm whales have a language of their own?
*  Right.
*  Are they talking to each other?
*  Really talking to each other?
*  If we could really show that whales had language on par with humans, that would be like finding
*  on another planet.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Carl, how should we think about this phonetic alphabet and whether sperm whales are actually
*  using it to talk to each other?
*  The scientists on this project are really careful to say that these results do not definitively
*  prove what these sperm whale sounds are.
*  There are a handful of possibilities here in terms of what this study could mean.
*  And one of them is that the whales really are using full-blown language.
*  What they might be talking about, we don't know.
*  Perhaps they like to talk about their travels over hundreds and thousands of miles.
*  Maybe they're talking about the giant squid that they caught last night.
*  Maybe they're gossiping about each other.
*  You have to remember, sperm whales are incredibly social animals.
*  They have relationships that last for decades.
*  And they live in groups that are in clans of thousands of whales.
*  Imagine the opportunities for gossip.
*  These are all at least imaginable now.
*  But it's also possible that they are communicating with each other, but in a way that isn't
*  language as we know it.
*  Maybe these sounds that they're producing don't add up to sentences.
*  There's no verb there.
*  There's no noun.
*  There's no structure to it in terms of how we think of language.
*  But maybe they're still conveying information to each other.
*  Maybe they're somehow giving out who they are and what group they belong to.
*  But it's not in the form of language that we think of.
*  Maybe it's more caveman-like, as in whale to whale.
*  Look, there, food.
*  It's possible, but other species have evolved in other directions.
*  So you have to put yourself in the place of a sperm whale.
*  So think about this.
*  They are communicating in the water.
*  Actually, sending sounds through water is a completely different experience than through
*  the air, like we do.
*  So a sperm whale might be communicating to the whale right next to it, a few yards away.
*  But it might be communicating with whales miles away, hundreds of miles away.
*  They're in the dark a lot of the time, so they don't even see the whales right next
*  to them.
*  So it's just this constant sound that they're making because they're in this dark water.
*  So we might want to imagine that such a species would talk the way we do, but there are just
*  so many reasons to expect that whatever they're communicating might be just profoundly different,
*  so different that it's actually hard for us to imagine.
*  So we need to really let ourselves be open to lots of possibilities.
*  One possibility that some scientists have raised is that maybe language is just the
*  wrong model to think about.
*  Maybe we need to think about music.
*  Maybe this strange typewriter clickety-clack is actually not like a Morse code message,
*  but is actually a real song.
*  It's a kind of music that doesn't necessarily convey information the way conversation does,
*  but it brings the whales together.
*  In humans, like when we humans sing together in choruses, it can be a very emotional experience.
*  It's a socially bonding experience.
*  But it's not really like the specific words that we're singing that bring us together
*  when we're singing.
*  It's sharing the music together.
*  But at a certain point, we stop singing in the chorus and we start asking each other
*  questions like, hey, what are you doing for dinner?
*  How are you going to get home?
*  There's a lot of traffic on the BQE.
*  So we are really drawn to the possibility that whales are communicating in that same
*  kind of a mode.
*  We're exchanging information.
*  We're seeking out each other's well-being and emotional state, and we're building something
*  together.
*  And I think that happens because, I mean, language is so fundamental to us as human
*  beings.
*  I mean, it's like every moment of our waking life depends on language.
*  We are talking to ourselves if we're not talking to other people.
*  In our sleep, we dream and there are words in our dreams.
*  We're just stewing in language.
*  And so it's really, really hard for us to understand how other species might have a
*  really complex communication system with hundreds of different little units of sound that they
*  can use and they can deploy.
*  And to think anything other than, well, they must be talking about traffic on the BQE.
*  We're very human-centric and we have to resist that.
*  So what we end up having here is a genuine breakthrough in our understanding of how whales
*  interact.
*  And that seems worth celebrating in and of itself, but it really kind of doubles as a
*  lesson in humility for us humans when it comes to appreciating the idea that there are lots
*  of non-human ways in which language can exist.
*  That's right.
*  Humility is always a good idea when we're thinking about other animals.
*  So what now happens in this realm of research and how is it that these scientists, these
*  marine biologists and these computer scientists, are going to try to figure out what exactly
*  this alphabet amounts to and how it's being used?
*  So what's going to happen now is a real sea change in gathering data from whales.
*  So to speak.
*  So these scientists are now deploying a new generation of undersea microphones.
*  They're using drones to follow these whales.
*  And what they want to do is they want to be recording sounds from the ocean where these
*  whales live 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
*  And so the hope is that instead of getting, say, a few hundred CODAS each year on recording,
*  these scientists want to get several hundred million every year, maybe billions of CODAS
*  every year.
*  And once you get that much data from whales, then you can start to do some really amazing
*  stuff with artificial intelligence.
*  So these scientists hope that they can use the same kind of artificial intelligence that
*  is behind things like chat GPT or these artificial intelligence systems that are able to take
*  recordings of people talking and transcribing them into text.
*  They want to use that on the whale communication.
*  They want to just grind through vast amounts of data and maybe they will discover more
*  phonetic letters in this alphabet.
*  Who knows?
*  Maybe they will actually find bigger structures, structures that could correspond to language.
*  If you go really far down this route of possibilities, the hope is that you would understand what
*  sperm whales are saying to each other so well that you could actually create artificial
*  sperm whale communication and you could play it underwater.
*  You could talk to the sperm whales and they would talk back.
*  They would react somehow in a way that you had predicted.
*  If that happens, then maybe indeed sperm whales have something like language as we
*  understand it.
*  And the only way we're going to figure that out is if we figure out not just how they
*  talk to themselves, but how we can perhaps talk to them, which given everything we've
*  been talking about here, Carl, is a little bit ironic because it's pretty human centric.
*  That's right.
*  This experiment could fail.
*  It's possible that sperm whales don't do anything like language as we know it.
*  Maybe they're doing something that we can't even imagine yet.
*  But if sperm whales really are using CODAs in something like language, we are going to
*  have to enter the conversation to really understand it.
*  Well, Carl, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  Sorry, can I say that again?
*  My voice got really high all of a sudden.
*  It's a little bit like a whale's.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Try again.
*  Thank you.
*  No, thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  We allege that Live Nation has illegally monopolized markets across the live concert industry in
*  the United States for far too long.
*  It is time to break it up.
*  On Thursday, the Justice Department sued the concert giant Live Nation Entertainment, which
*  owns Ticketmaster, for violating federal antitrust laws and sought to break up the
*  $23 billion conglomerate.
*  During a news conference, Attorney General Merrick Garland said that Live Nation's monopolistic
*  tactics had hurt the entire industry of live events.
*  The result is that fans pay more in fees, artists have fewer opportunities to play concerts,
*  smaller promoters get squeezed out, and venues have fewer real choices.
*  In a statement, Live Nation called the lawsuit baseless and vowed to fight it in court.
*  A reminder, tomorrow we'll be sharing the latest episode of our colleague's new show,
*  The Interview.
*  This week on The Interview, Lulu Garcia Navarro talks with Ted Sarandos, the CEO of Netflix,
*  about his plans to make the world's largest streaming service even bigger.
*  I don't agree with the premise that quantity and quality are somehow in conflict with each other.
*  I think our content and our movie programming has been great, but it's just not all for you.
*  Today's episode was produced by Alex Stern, Stella Tan, Sydney Harper, and Nina Feldman.
*  It was edited by MJ Davis-Lynn, contains original music by Pat McCusker, Dan Powell,
*  Alicia Ba-Eetoo, Mary Lozano, and Sophia Landman.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Runberg and Ben Lansferk of Wonderly.
*  Special thanks to Project SETI for sharing their whale recordings.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  See you on Tuesday, after the holiday.
