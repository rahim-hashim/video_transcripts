# Iran Retaliates
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ez2vE5dH6A)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Israel's stunning series of military successes against its longtime foe, Hezbollah, raised
*  the question of whether the group's backer, Iran, would retaliate.
*  On Tuesday, we got the answer.
*  With the largest missile attack on Israeli territory in the country's history.
*  Today, my colleagues Patrick Kingsley and Farnaz Fassihi on how Israel and Iran each
*  see this dangerous moment and where it might lead.
*  It's Thursday, October 3rd.
*  So Patrick, the Middle East was already in chaos and has only gotten worse and really
*  seems to be on the edge of some big, dangerous unknown.
*  Can you give us the state of affairs at 9.50am on Wednesday?
*  It feels like we may be witnessing some kind of paradigm shift.
*  The power dynamics in the region possibly shifting before our eyes.
*  Hezbollah, the very powerful militia in Lebanon, adversary of Israel, state within a state
*  within Lebanon, is severely weakened.
*  Hezbollah has been assassinating its leaders methodically over the last several weeks,
*  exploding Hezbollah's pages and communications devices, mounting some of the most intense
*  bombardments in contemporary warfare, killing many Hezbollah operatives, but also many civilians.
*  The culmination of this was the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, on
*  Friday evening.
*  That was a seismic event.
*  Nasrallah was immensely influential, immensely powerful, and it's hard to overstate how much
*  of a blow his death was to Hezbollah.
*  He was their talisman.
*  He was their longtime leader, their strategist.
*  In particular, he was a key ally of Iran, and he had turned Hezbollah into one of the
*  strongest fighting forces in the Middle East and in the process provided Iran with a strong
*  military ally that was able to act as a powerful and menacing deterrent to Israel.
*  Would Israel ever decide to attack Iran and to destroy Iran's nuclear program?
*  Just an enormous blow, not just to Hezbollah, which for many decades had been this loaded
*  gun pointed at Israel's head, but the regional power behind Hezbollah, Iran.
*  Exactly.
*  But why now?
*  Since October 7th, Israel and Hezbollah have been going back and forth over that border.
*  Israel has displaced tens of thousands of people, but it's been bumping along in a kind
*  of low-grade way for months.
*  Why did Israel choose this moment to kill Nasrallah?
*  All the while, it was expected that if the war in Gaza reached a conclusion, the war
*  between Israel and Hezbollah on the northern border would die down, that there would also
*  be a diplomatic solution between the two sides there.
*  But what happened this summer was the gradual realization that the war in Gaza was not going
*  to end anytime soon, that there was not going to be a truce between Hamas and Israel.
*  And the result was that Israel decided that it could no longer wait for a diplomatic resolution
*  to the conflict with its Lebanese adversary and decided to try and end it by military
*  means.
*  And so a few weeks ago, they started escalating, moving beyond this low-intensity border war
*  and eventually culminating in the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah on Friday.
*  And we had expected that if Israel escalated to this extent, Hezbollah would match it with
*  the same kind of intensity, firing deep into Israeli territory, bombarding Israel's biggest
*  cities with barrages of rockets and missiles, potentially taking out Israel's power grid.
*  In reality, that did not happen.
*  And why not?
*  It's not entirely clear, but there were two possible reasons.
*  One, Hezbollah was genuinely thrown into disarray, its leaders killed, its strategists dead.
*  Israel may have taken out so many Hezbollah rocket stockpiles that the group simply was
*  not able to follow through on its long-planned assaults.
*  In addition, Iran, its biggest benefactor and key ally, also for weeks did not seem prepared
*  to get involved.
*  Israel killed Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in July, and Iran said that it would
*  respond in revenge for that attack because he was killed in an Iranian military compound
*  in Tehran, the Iranian capital.
*  But Iran didn't respond to that.
*  And it didn't respond when Hezbollah's commanders started getting killed.
*  It didn't respond immediately when Nasrallah was killed.
*  And it fell over the weekend like Israel had changed the rules of the game, that contrary
*  to expectations, it had sufficiently instilled fear in Hezbollah and Iran, destroying their
*  military capabilities to the extent that they were not able of firing back.
*  And that led, late on Monday, to Israel taking things a step further and sending ground forces
*  into Lebanon, invading Lebanon with several thousand troops.
*  And it felt that Israel had been able to make more and more dramatic moves without facing
*  significant consequence from Hezbollah and its benefactor, Iran.
*  Patrick, I'm thinking back to the beginning of the Gaza War.
*  And the big fear of the US and the rest of the world was that if Israel escalated against
*  Hezbollah, it would be met with a giant response.
*  And it would pull Iran in and eventually the US into this big regional war.
*  This is why the Biden administration encouraged Netanyahu not to do it.
*  But as this was playing out, as we were watching this over the past 10 days or so, it felt
*  like maybe everyone was wrong, like that Israel could roll through, could decimate Hezbollah
*  and really not face a huge consequence.
*  Exactly.
*  And that's how it felt until mid-afternoon on Tuesday when we started getting reports
*  from our sources saying that maybe Iran, after all that, was planning a massive attack.
*  A statement just out from the White House, here it is, quote, the United States has indications
*  that Iran is preparing to eminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.
*  And suddenly the assumption that Iran was not going to respond to any of these moves
*  over the last week appeared to have been proven wrong.
*  Israel implemented sudden restrictions on movement and the number of people that could
*  gather in one place, which is always a sign that the Israeli authorities think an attack
*  is imminent.
*  And then at 7.30 local time.
*  We started to hear the chilling sound of the air raid sirens that are triggered whenever
*  there is an incoming rocket or missile attack.
*  And that prompted millions of Israelis to hurry into the bomb shelters that are installed
*  in many homes and workplaces.
*  Dana, we're seeing them coming from multiple directions here, to my left.
*  And within under 15 minutes.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Oh, God.
*  OK, guys, we've got to get off the roof.
*  These are coming down right next to us here.
*  We started hearing the sounds of the missiles arriving.
*  All told, Israel says that roughly 180 missiles were fired in several waves over the course
*  of about an hour.
*  It was one of, if not the biggest attack of its kind in the history of warfare.
*  Many if not most of the missiles were intercepted by Israel's air defense system.
*  And U.S. naval forces stationed in the eastern Mediterranean helped shoot down more.
*  Some fell to earth, causing craters in several parts of Israel.
*  The upshot was that only one person was killed, a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank.
*  And there was not significant damage to Israeli infrastructure apart from three air bases
*  and possibly the area of the Mossad headquarters, the headquarters of Israel's foreign intelligence
*  agency.
*  Nevertheless, it felt like a significant escalation from Iran.
*  There were missiles aimed and which even hit some of the densest urban areas in the country.
*  And it feels like Iran did this knowing that Israel would feel that it had little or no
*  choice but to respond in kind.
*  Well, where is it going to go from now?
*  How is Israel thinking about the retaliation to what you're saying is this huge counterattack
*  from Iran?
*  Now we're waiting very intensely to see how Israel responds.
*  From what we understand, both listening to the words of Israeli leaders themselves, but
*  also talking behind the scenes to officials and diplomats and analysts, there is no way
*  that Israel will let this pass.
*  They will respond and those options include taking out oil refineries, taking out military
*  bases and also at the far end of the spectrum, targeting Iran's nuclear facilities in which
*  Iran is accused of trying to build a nuclear bomb.
*  You mentioned that the US military was actively shooting down rockets alongside the Israeli
*  air defense.
*  Do we expect the US to be actively involved in the retaliation?
*  And will that effectively be the United States being drawn into a war with Iran?
*  That's the million dollar question right now.
*  How much support is the US going to give Israel?
*  There are certain things that Israel will find it very difficult to do without US support.
*  That includes targeting those nuclear facilities, many of which are housed deep below ground
*  and which require rare kinds of bunker busting bombs and particular kinds of planes in order
*  to carry those bombs.
*  All of that, according to military experts, really requires American support, know-how
*  and even the US to carry it out in the first place.
*  From what we understand from talking with US officials, the US is very unlikely to give
*  that kind of support.
*  There are still very many other options that Israel doesn't need the support of the Biden
*  administration to carry out.
*  That includes targeting the oil production facilities.
*  It includes targeting military bases.
*  They've already shown they have the ability to do that.
*  And there's every expectation that they'll do the same in a more dramatic fashion in
*  the coming days.
*  If we see Israel hit Iran's nuclear sites in retaliation, we should consider that a
*  big escalation.
*  But so far, that seems unlikely, and you'd expect other targets to be hit instead.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  At the same time, though, you can't rule anything out.
*  To Israel's critics, Israel is the main source of unrest in the Middle East.
*  It's failed to reach peace with the Palestinians.
*  It's invading Lebanon.
*  It's bombing Beirut.
*  But in the mind of many Israelis, they feel like they are the victims of a malign alliance
*  led by Iran that contains many powerful proxies across the Middle East.
*  They feel that they have not done enough to project strength and to deter Iran and its
*  allies from attacking Israel in the future.
*  And the backdrop to all this is the deep feelings of guilt and regret from both Israel's military
*  establishment and its political leadership under Benjamin Netanyahu about their failure
*  to prevent the Hamas-led attack on October 7th of last year.
*  And it's possible that those kinds of emotions also inform their responses to subsequent
*  threats ever since.
*  Right, the biggest sign of weakness for Israel in a very long time, and a perception that
*  they seem very keen to reverse.
*  They feel they're facing an existential threat and to combat existential threats, you have
*  to not only project strength, but to be strong.
*  And what makes this such a recipe for disaster is that they are not alone in this.
*  Iran also feels more or less the same way, that they feel a threat from Israel and they
*  feel they have shown weakness in the past months and need to rectify that.
*  After the break, Farnas Fasihi on Iran's Perspective.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So we just talked to our colleague Patrick Kingsley and he told us that right now Israel
*  feels like it needs to appear strong because they see Iran and Iran's proxies as an existential
*  threat and that's why they're going so hard after Hezbollah, Iran's number one proxy.
*  But he also said that Iran feels the same way, that they need to appear strong in the
*  face of Israel's attack on those proxies.
*  And you, Farnas, are our resident Iran expert with deep sourcing inside government circles.
*  Tell us what all of this looks like from Iran's point of view.
*  From Iran's point of view, they also feel like they're under attack.
*  The investments that they've made in the militia that are aligned with them in the region,
*  the military alliance known as the Axis of Resistance from Hezbollah in Lebanon to Houthis
*  in Yemen, the militias in Iraq and Syria, it had viewed these militia as its forward
*  a way to deter attacks on its own soil and as a way to sort of keep a balance of power
*  with both Israel and the United States.
*  So Israel's wave of attacks recently on particularly Hezbollah that culminated in the killing of
*  Mr. Nasrallah was a tremendous blow to Iran.
*  It diminished a force that it had relied on if it came under threat.
*  So for Iran, the same way that Patrick explained that Israel feels it has an existential threat,
*  Iran feels like it's under existential threat.
*  So following Mr. Nasrallah's killing, they faced a choice to go attack Israel directly
*  and retaliate and risk an all out war that could threaten their own existence or if they
*  were going to lay low but risk looking weak and invite possible attacks.
*  Either way, for Iran, it was a difficult dilemma to face.
*  So what are they weighing as they're trying to make this choice between going hard on
*  Israel or restraining themselves?
*  They are weighing whether Iran can afford to not respond to Israel.
*  You have to remember that in July, Israel assassinated Hamas's political leader, Ismail
*  Haniyeh, in Tehran on the eve of the inauguration of the new president.
*  They killed him in a very secure compound of the Revolutionary Guards.
*  And for Iran, this was a big humiliation.
*  It was very damaging to their sense of national security or to being able to protect their
*  key allies and guests on their own soil.
*  And for a few weeks, the immediate reaction from Iranian senior leaders and military commanders
*  was a pledge to take revenge against Israel, to strike back against Israel.
*  There was a lot of diplomacy, particularly by the US through its allies, to try to convince
*  it to exercise its strength, telling Iran that if you attack Israel, you're going to
*  jeopardize a ceasefire that is being negotiated between Israel and Hamas for Gaza, that you
*  may risk taking the region into a wider war.
*  And so they convinced Iran to hold back.
*  And so Iran did not retaliate at that time.
*  Yeah, and it felt very surprising because this was the mighty, all-powerful, much feared
*  Iran, and they were humiliated on their own soil.
*  And they just don't hit back, which really defied expectations.
*  It really did defy expectations, restraining themselves only to see in a few months that
*  Netanyahu was more emboldened, that it went into Lebanon with the explosion of the pagers
*  and the walkie-talkies and the strike on Hezbollah commanders and ultimately the killing of Mr.
*  Nasrallah.
*  Iranian officials that I've been speaking to say that in retrospect, that decision was
*  wrong.
*  And the reckoning inside Iran is that if they had reacted to Mr. Hani's killing, perhaps
*  Nasrallah would be alive.
*  And that now, looking ahead, they can't really have the world sitting with that impression,
*  right?
*  Israel will keep going further and further, and the world will see Iran as kind of a paper
*  tiger.
*  Exactly.
*  This is the narrative that they wanted to change, that Iran was weak, that Iran was
*  not going to defend itself.
*  And also remember, Sabrina, officials were telling me that they were also worried that
*  these military alliances they'd made in the region would look at Iran and say that you're
*  not defending us, that your closest ally was killed by Israel and you did nothing.
*  So they also wanted to bolster those ties and sort of not give the impression that Iran
*  would take it all and not respond.
*  Iran very much felt like Netanyahu was blowing through all the red lines, particularly with
*  the killing of Nasrallah, and that they needed to reestablish some rules.
*  So after days of debating, the senior military commanders and the generals won the debate
*  inside Iran and convinced Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to order direct strikes against
*  Israel.
*  Right.
*  That is exactly what we saw happen last night, overnight, the largest military barrage in
*  the history of the Israeli state, as Patrick was saying.
*  Exactly.
*  And now Iranians are anxious.
*  The majority of people don't want war, and everyone's waiting to see what's going to
*  happen.
*  So it feels worth pointing out at this point that the Iranian response was huge and meant
*  to inflict serious damage to Israel, but of course it didn't succeed.
*  So I guess the question is, did this attack make Iran look strong like they wanted, or
*  did it actually reinforce how incapable they've been in recent times to hurt Israel?
*  I think from the perspective of the Iranians and from the perspective of the region, it
*  restored some of their credibility, both at home among their constituents and also regionally
*  on the Arab street, as we saw a lot of cheering in many Arab cities last night for Iran's
*  actions.
*  But in terms of military tactical success, you're right that if the aim was to take out
*  Israeli military bases, they didn't achieve that because Israel has the superior military
*  power and air force than intelligence to Iran.
*  But if we want to take a broader look at Iran's strategy, this just escalates the stakes.
*  It makes it a lot more difficult to calculate a war with Iran.
*  That sure, Iran is maybe not as strong as it wants to project, but it's not going to
*  be defeated easily.
*  That if Israel or the United States or its allies decide to attack it, they're going
*  to have a wider regional chaos and mess on their hands.
*  And I think for Iran's purposes, that message is also something that they wanted to send.
*  But how do they fight back?
*  Iran's military, as you said, is not a match for Israel's.
*  And their main proxy, Hezbollah, is severely weakened.
*  So what do they have to fight back with?
*  Well, Iran's defense strategy has been mostly investing in its missiles and drones and also
*  investing in unconventional warfare by arming and funding and training these militia groups
*  in the region.
*  So one view is that in the short term, Iran may not be a match for Israel's superior
*  air power.
*  But in the long term, because of these proxies and because of the investments that it has
*  made in the region, that it could win the longer game or it could inflict more pain
*  that way.
*  As we've seen with the wars in Afghanistan and with the war in Iraq and elsewhere, superior
*  military powers don't always win the longer game.
*  And the other thing that we've been hearing from senior Iranian officials in the past
*  few months is this idea that if Iran feels an existential threat, it might change its
*  nuclear doctrine and policy.
*  Iran has maintained all these years that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes,
*  but it has crossed the threshold of being a nuclear capable state, meaning that if it
*  decides that it wants to pursue a weaponized program, it can.
*  I see.
*  Now, experts say that building a bomb would take closer to a year.
*  But this is something that is even currently being discussed.
*  Just following Nasrallah's killing, there were analysts on state television saying that
*  in order to protect the Islamic Republic and the country, Iran needed to build the ultimate
*  deterrence, which is a nuclear bomb.
*  Unless of course Israel takes out that capability first by bombing it.
*  Yes, but that's very challenging.
*  It's not easy.
*  It would require the help of the United States.
*  And on Wednesday, President Biden said that he's against an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
*  But the question is whether Israel has other ways, including covert attacks.
*  And if it does decide that unilaterally it wants to bomb the nuclear facilities, will
*  it draw in the United States, even if it doesn't want to?
*  And then if the US is drawn into this war, will Iran's powerful allies, Russia and China,
*  also enter the war?
*  Right.
*  Iran has forged very close military and intelligence ties with Russia and very close economic ties
*  to China.
*  So you could see a scenario where this war and this conflict could very quickly morph
*  into something much bigger than between Iran and Israel.
*  And one thing we've learned from all these wars in the Middle East, from Afghanistan
*  to Iraq to Syria and Gaza and Lebanon and now potentially Iran, is that these wars start
*  in one way, but there's no telling how they will end and what the consequences will be
*  and what other actors will get involved.
*  And right now we're in one of those pivotal moments where the chaos and violence that
*  we've seen raging in the region for the past year could get worse in unpredictable ways.
*  We just don't know.
*  For now, thank you.
*  Thank you for having me, Sabrina.
*  On Wednesday, Israel said that eight of its soldiers had been killed in close-range combat
*  in southern Lebanon.
*  It appeared to be the first direct ground confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel
*  since Israel's invasion of Lebanon began.
*  The fighting showed that Hezbollah remained capable of carrying out deadly attacks.
*  Meanwhile, in Lebanon's capital, several huge explosions erupted around midnight and the
*  Lebanese Health Ministry said early Thursday that six people had been killed.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, a federal judge partly unsealed a new filing from special counsel Jack Smith,
*  arguing that the case that former President Donald Trump tried to steal the 2020 election
*  should go forward despite a recent Supreme Court ruling on his immunity from prosecution
*  for official conduct.
*  Smith used the 165-page brief to paint the indictment's many individual allegations
*  as private acts, writing that, quote,
*  His scheme was fundamentally a private one.
*  The brief includes new details about Trump's response to the January 6th attack on the
*  Capitol.
*  When an aide informed President Trump that his social media post had endangered the safety
*  of Vice President Mike Pence, Trump responded, quote,
*  So what?
*  And President Biden ordered 1,000 active-duty troops to help with Hurricane Helene relief
*  efforts.
*  At least 176 people have died, and it remains unclear how many are still missing.
*  Biden visited North and South Carolina to assess the damage, and Vice President Kamala
*  Harris scrapped her campaign plans in Pennsylvania and instead went to Georgia to pledge the
*  administration's support for recovery.
