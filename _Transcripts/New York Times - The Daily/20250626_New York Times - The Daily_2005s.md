# Breaking Down the Massive Cuts to Science Funding
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kicheroff. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=5.24s)]
*  In the months since taking office, President Trump has made billions of dollars in cuts [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  to scientific research, essentially saying science has become too woke. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=19.2s)]
*  Today, my colleague, Emily Anthes, on what's being targeted, what's being cut, and how [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=25.639999999999997s)]
*  much the world of science is about to change. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  It's Thursday, June 26th. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=37.76s)]
*  Emily, hi. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=45.84s)]
*  Hi. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=46.84s)]
*  Are you, you're in your closet? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=47.84s)]
*  I am in my closet, yes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=49.72s)]
*  This is the best recording space I have. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=51.2s)]
*  Well, we're really grateful that you're here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=53.559999999999995s)]
*  Thanks so much for having me. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=56.72s)]
*  I'm happy to be here. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=57.72s)]
*  So we've been watching over the past several months as the Trump administration has done [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  this blitz of spending cuts across the federal government. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=65.44s)]
*  But it's been really hard to parse exactly what was being axed because all of this has [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=69.12s)]
*  been really fast and furious. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=75.16s)]
*  And you and a team of reporters spent months looking into a very specific set of cuts. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=78.08s)]
*  Take me through that work. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=84.4s)]
*  Well, I'm a science reporter. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=85.4s)]
*  And so my colleagues and I always have our eyes peeled for changes in the world of science, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=87.32s)]
*  disruption in scientific research. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=93.2s)]
*  And from the very beginning of the Trump administration, we were hearing quite clearly and loudly that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=96.16s)]
*  the administration was cutting research. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=102.24s)]
*  They've been putting out essentially press releases saying, we're cutting research on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=105.04s)]
*  transgender health, we're cutting grants to Harvard. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=110.04s)]
*  And so some of this was happening very publicly. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=113.56s)]
*  But my colleagues and I also spend our days talking to a lot of researchers and scientists. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=116.80000000000001s)]
*  And we started hearing from a lot of people that my study wasn't listed on this press [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=122.64000000000001s)]
*  release that was put out by the administration. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=128.64000000000001s)]
*  I've been waiting months for my next year of funding. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=131.72s)]
*  And I can't get anyone in the federal government to explain what's happening to me. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't have any estimate for when the money is coming. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=141.83999999999997s)]
*  And some of these scientists began wondering if their studies had essentially been quietly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=145.12s)]
*  canceled, had their grants been terminated, and no one had even bothered to tell them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=151.2s)]
*  There's a sense that maybe beyond all that's been publicly announced, there's something [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=156.76s)]
*  under the surface going on as well. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=160.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=163.12s)]
*  And up and down the entire sort of Byzantine scientific funding process, we were hearing [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=164.12s)]
*  of way more disruptions than were being announced. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=170.28s)]
*  So my colleagues and I wanted to try to take a closer look at this to get a sense of what [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=174.6s)]
*  was happening behind the scenes, beyond the press releases and the announcements. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=179.8s)]
*  We decided to focus on one particular agency, the National Institute of Health. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=185.96s)]
*  And it sounds like kind of a niche agency. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  It's maybe not one that Americans think about every day around the breakfast table. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  But it plays a huge role in American life and in the American economy, and even in the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=198.44s)]
*  economy globally. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=205.0s)]
*  Worldwide it is the largest public funder of medical research. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=207.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=210.68s)]
*  NIH funding has led to countless breakthroughs, countless Nobel Prizes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=211.68s)]
*  Many of the drugs and medications we have on the market today would not exist if not [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=218.08s)]
*  for NIH-funded research. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=222.72s)]
*  So it has been this enormous engine of innovation and of medical discovery. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=224.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=231.32s)]
*  So how did you go about figuring out what was going on with this funding? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=232.32s)]
*  And what did you find about what was being cut? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=237.68s)]
*  Well, it was an enormous task. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  And so it was a huge team effort. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  I worked with other reporters on the science desk. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=244.44s)]
*  We worked closely with our colleagues on the data team who are coding wizards and are amazing [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=248.0s)]
*  at sorting through enormous public databases. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=254.64000000000001s)]
*  We worked with some colleagues on the graphics team to help us visualize what we were finding. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=258.08s)]
*  But it all started with what is a public database. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=263.24s)]
*  Because NIH is publicly funded, it keeps a database of all of its grants, all of its [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=267.24s)]
*  awards online for anyone to look at. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  But it can be tricky to parse to know what you're looking at. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=276.0s)]
*  These entries are basically a long string of grant numbers, maybe a project title and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  an abstract, and then a bunch of dates. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=285.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, it might say this project was funded on X date and its last payment came three [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=287.8s)]
*  months ago and it's scheduled to continue for another three years. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=292.92s)]
*  So it's all really rich data, but hard to make sense of, especially at scale. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=297.16s)]
*  But our data team combed through it and was able to look for anomalies, essentially. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  So they were able to pull out examples of projects that, you know, the NIH's own record [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=309.68s)]
*  showed should have gotten their funding three months ago, but it was still pending. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=315.48s)]
*  Or projects where the end date that was listed in this database used to say 2027 and all [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  of a sudden it had been changed to say 2025. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  And we started to piece together this bigger picture of what was happening outside of the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=331.44s)]
*  headlines. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=336.36s)]
*  So what did you find? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=337.64s)]
*  What were the patterns that you were able to draw out of this? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=339.88s)]
*  Well, first, we found that what was happening seemed profoundly abnormal. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  Typically, researchers get multi-year grants that might last three to five years, and it's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=348.24s)]
*  extremely rare for them to be canceled midstream. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=353.84s)]
*  The sources we talked to said that might happen fewer than 20 times a year, and it's often [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=357.56s)]
*  for extenuating circumstances like a researcher getting sick or being suspected of research [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=363.24s)]
*  misconduct. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=369.48s)]
*  But in just the first few months of this administration, we found 1,400 awards that were canceled midstream. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  And that was 1,400 as of the time we first published our findings three weeks ago. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=378.28s)]
*  That number has now gone up to 1,700 canceled awards. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=383.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=386.84s)]
*  And when we started to look at them a little more closely, some patterns did emerge. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=387.36s)]
*  A lot of these grants were focused on marginalized groups, underrepresented groups, racial and [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=393.36s)]
*  ethnic minorities in some way. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=400.0s)]
*  And when I say in some way, that's because there were sort of two different buckets of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=403.32000000000005s)]
*  grants that we were seeing affected. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=409.36s)]
*  One of these buckets are grants that focus on underrepresented and marginalized groups [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=411.8s)]
*  as the subjects of research. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  And these are often groups that haven't historically been included in research very much or studied [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  very well. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=425.12s)]
*  And the way NIH funding works is that researchers don't just send in whatever ideas they [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=426.44000000000005s)]
*  want. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=433.04s)]
*  The NIH puts out requests for scientific proposals asking researchers to propose research [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=434.04s)]
*  on various topics. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=441.36s)]
*  And some of these requests are very broad. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=443.44s)]
*  At the broadest, they might just say, send us ideas for research that relates to human [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=446.48s)]
*  health. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=450.44s)]
*  But some of these requests for proposals are asking researchers to submit ideas for studies [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=451.44s)]
*  on specific underrepresented groups or marginalized groups on gay men or bisexual women or non-binary [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=457.04s)]
*  adolescents. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=466.8s)]
*  And although many of these groups might be small in number in the case of non-binary [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=468.70000000000005s)]
*  adolescents, there are a lot of different groups in the U.S. that are understudied. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=473.68s)]
*  And some of these groups are quite large. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=478.92s)]
*  Black women famously are understudied in medicine. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=481.28000000000003s)]
*  And there's been a lot of efforts to encourage more research into health conditions that [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=485.04s)]
*  are of particular risk to black women. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=491.28000000000003s)]
*  And this focus on specific identity groups and populations is what the Trump administration [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=495.12s)]
*  sees as problematic. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=502.12s)]
*  They have argued that these studies don't fit with the administration's scientific agenda. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=504.44s)]
*  And they've essentially argued that using taxpayer funding to study particular subpopulations [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=510.56s)]
*  doesn't benefit the health of all Americans. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=517.24s)]
*  Got it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=520.92s)]
*  And how does the administration go about targeting those studies, finding the ones that they [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=522.04s)]
*  want to ask for those reasons? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=530.4s)]
*  So we've heard from some NIH insiders that what it seems like the administration is doing [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=533.1s)]
*  is essentially searching for keywords that it's decided are problematic. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=539.88s)]
*  Some of these program officers will say they get lists of grants that have words like non-binary [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=546.04s)]
*  or racism in the title. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=552.04s)]
*  And they've sort of gotten the impression that someone somewhere has just hit control [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=554.64s)]
*  F and looked for some of these keywords to pick out grants that it doesn't think fits [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=559.28s)]
*  with the agenda. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  You're essentially saying that these insiders believe the administration is subjecting [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=566.08s)]
*  these studies to like a search term test. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=572.48s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=575.48s)]
*  That's what they've said looks like is happening. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=576.48s)]
*  So what are some of the actual studies that you found the Trump administration cancelled [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=579.96s)]
*  that fit under this umbrella? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=585.24s)]
*  Well, they really run the gamut and I can give you some exact studies. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=587.5600000000001s)]
*  If I scroll through our list here, please do. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=593.8s)]
*  Here's one study how racism affects dementia risk in older Asian Americans. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=598.0799999999999s)]
*  Here I'm looking at the study on reducing suicide risk for transgender and gender diverse [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=604.7199999999999s)]
*  young adults. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=610.4599999999999s)]
*  Here's one that was cancelled on identifying COVID-19 misinformation, including misinformation [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=612.52s)]
*  related to vaccines in black and rural communities. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  Here's one more I'll give you studying the genetic causes of bipolar disorder in East [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=624.36s)]
*  and South Asia. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=629.68s)]
*  Yeah, some of these are really quite specific, honestly. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=630.84s)]
*  They are and I talked to the researchers conducting some of these studies. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=636.16s)]
*  I am a fifth year doctoral student now doctoral candidate in the Department of Clinical Psychology [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=640.16s)]
*  at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  One of them is a doctoral student named Katherine Bogan. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=647.68s)]
*  This is my focus. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  It's how do bisexual women experience sexual violence? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  How do they talk about it? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=654.4s)]
*  And she has been studying post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use, and the risk of domestic [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=656.28s)]
*  violence specifically among bisexual women. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=662.8399999999999s)]
*  Why that group? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=666.7199999999999s)]
*  Why specifically bisexual women? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=667.7199999999999s)]
*  That was a question I asked her too. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=670.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, bisexual women experience more severe and more frequent sexual violence than either [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=673.24s)]
*  heterosexual or lesbian women. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=678.52s)]
*  She told me that bisexual women are actually at increased risk of intimate partner violence. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=681.88s)]
*  And so one, this is a group that she thought there really needed to be more research and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=687.64s)]
*  focus on. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=692.88s)]
*  But two, she thought that studying bisexual women would be instructive and that by understanding [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=693.88s)]
*  more about their experiences, she might learn things that could help all women. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=699.76s)]
*  Like anytime you focus on the most marginalized people in a society and say, you know what, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  we want to see how to make these folks lives better, society in general improves. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=708.96s)]
*  So I see where she's coming from. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=715.84s)]
*  But just to play devil's advocate for a moment here, it does seem like she is looking at [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=718.56s)]
*  a niche group here. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=726.84s)]
*  From the Trump administration's perspective, they're asking, wait, why would American taxpayer [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=729.64s)]
*  dollars go to fund work that involves such a small group of people? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=737.08s)]
*  Yeah, and as devastated as she was to hear that her study was cut, in some ways she wasn't [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=744.08s)]
*  totally surprised. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=750.4000000000001s)]
*  My grant had bisexual women in the title. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=751.96s)]
*  And I know two of the words on these banned words lists for federal funding were bisexual [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=754.72s)]
*  and women. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  So I certainly had concerns that it would be caught in slags. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  She saw this coming to a certain extent. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=764.6800000000001s)]
*  She hoped it wouldn't come, but she had a feeling that it might happen. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=767.52s)]
*  But at the same time, she's unapologetic about her work and the focus of her research. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  She describes herself as a feminist scientist doing work that she hopes will advance equity. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=779.56s)]
*  She is bisexual herself. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=786.7199999999999s)]
*  And so given all that, I asked her, did she see her own work as political? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  Good question. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=795.2399999999999s)]
*  And she sent me a long and pretty thoughtful response. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=796.3599999999999s)]
*  And I'll just read a little bit of it to you here. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=799.9599999999999s)]
*  She said, I don't think it matters whether I see my work as political, given that it [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  was initially funded for being critical, sound, impactful science that could contribute [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=807.16s)]
*  to public well-being. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=812.76s)]
*  She also added that, yes, her work is political, quote, in the sense that politics are played [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=814.6s)]
*  out in the stuff of people's lives. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=820.48s)]
*  And then she added, but I also think sound science is sound science, regardless of which [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=822.92s)]
*  identities are the focus of that work. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=827.68s)]
*  What do you make of that response? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=831.24s)]
*  As a science journalist, how do you see the way she views her work? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=834.12s)]
*  Because I think a lot of us might think of science as something that kind of floats above [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=839.6s)]
*  the political fray. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=846.12s)]
*  And that's not what she's saying here. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=847.96s)]
*  No, that is definitely not what she's saying. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=850.12s)]
*  And there are a lot of scientists out there who would agree with her. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=853.52s)]
*  Not even just scientists who study identity. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=857.34s)]
*  a lot of different fields who view their work as having a political element to it, and they [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=860.9599999999999s)]
*  don't view that as a bad thing. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=866.76s)]
*  But there are also scientists who definitely would resist that characterization. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=869.56s)]
*  They view their work as sort of some, quote unquote, objective search for truth and finding [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=874.16s)]
*  facts and data, and would just be happy to be left out of the political conversation [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=881.04s)]
*  altogether. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=886.88s)]
*  The other thing about some of these studies is that sure, they're focused on specific [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=888.84s)]
*  populations, but they're not necessarily small populations. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  We're seeing research cut that focuses on how to reduce maternal mortality in black [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=898.76s)]
*  women. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=904.0400000000001s)]
*  And black women, of course, are a huge segment of the US population. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=905.2s)]
*  And maternal mortality is a huge longstanding problem in that group. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=910.1600000000001s)]
*  It's hard to dismiss those concerns as niche. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=915.08s)]
*  Totally. We're talking about broad swaths of America here. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=918.4399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. And when you really look at it historically, it's not like medical research [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=921.68s)]
*  once wasn't niche or was once extremely diverse and inclusive. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=928.04s)]
*  For most of history, medical research focused narrowly on a very specific population, and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=933.56s)]
*  that is white men. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=939.24s)]
*  Right. Niche is kind of in the eye of the beholder. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=940.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=943.64s)]
*  And in this case, the beholder is the Trump administration. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=945.6s)]
*  But there is a whole other category of cuts, we found, that might be more surprising. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=954.0400000000001s)]
*  And these are cuts to grants on some of the most critical health and disease issues we [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=960.4000000000001s)]
*  face. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  And these are studies that a lot of Americans, frankly, probably wouldn't find controversial [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=967.4000000000001s)]
*  in any way. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=972.2800000000001s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=975.2s)]
*  Emily, tell me about this other category of cuts to studies that you said most Americans [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=989.5200000000001s)]
*  probably wouldn't find all that controversial. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, unlike that first bucket of studies, where the research itself was focused on underrepresented [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=997.0s)]
*  groups or marginalized populations, these are studies that could be focused on literally [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1003.0s)]
*  anything. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1008.8s)]
*  Cancer, autoimmune disease, dementia. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1009.8s)]
*  But what sets them apart is that they were all funded specifically through mechanisms [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1013.4s)]
*  designed to diversify the scientific workforce. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1018.52s)]
*  So the NIH puts out calls for research proposals, in some cases on specific topics, but they [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1022.6s)]
*  also put out proposals for research from specific types of researchers. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1030.08s)]
*  So it could be scientists who are members of certain racial or ethnic groups, but it [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1035.28s)]
*  also includes scientists who grew up in rural areas, scientists with disabilities. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1040.48s)]
*  Scientists who meet one of these criteria can often apply for a separate pot of money [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1046.68s)]
*  that's set aside specifically to help diversify science. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1050.8s)]
*  It's kind of like affirmative action in a way for science. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1056.12s)]
*  Essentially, yes, that is what it is, though it's not automatic by any means. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1059.44s)]
*  Just like in other contexts, scientists who want to get this money still have to go through [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1065.04s)]
*  a rigorous application process, and they only are awarded these grants if peer reviewers [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1069.96s)]
*  decide that their project is important. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1075.92s)]
*  But we've seen that the Trump administration very clearly doesn't want this kind of thing, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1079.64s)]
*  doesn't want diversity and equity programs. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1085.84s)]
*  It's anti-DEI. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1088.72s)]
*  And so it tracks that he and the administration wouldn't be pleased with funding being allocated [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1090.56s)]
*  based on people's identities. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1097.48s)]
*  It absolutely tracks. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1100.16s)]
*  We know that on day one of his administration, President Trump issued an executive order, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1101.92s)]
*  essentially putting an end to quote unquote DEI and affirmative action programs throughout [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1107.24s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1113.72s)]
*  But the thing is, those sorts of cuts are really sweeping. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1115.92s)]
*  And researchers who were getting this grant money designated for underrepresented groups [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1119.96s)]
*  were studying all kinds of conditions and ailments that are of concern to many Americans. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  They were studying cancer, they were studying diabetes, they were studying dementia. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1133.6000000000001s)]
*  In many cases, their work had nothing to do with specific populations or identities. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1138.44s)]
*  It's just that they themselves happened to be from an underrepresented group. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1144.92s)]
*  What do the scientists say? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1149.44s)]
*  Yeah, I talked to some other researchers whose studies were caught up in these cuts. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1151.16s)]
*  And a lot of them said that they were sort of blindsided. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1156.44s)]
*  A lot of them hadn't thought that their work was at risk, that it didn't seem to be the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1159.8400000000001s)]
*  type of work that the administration would be targeting. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  Give me an example of that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1169.3200000000002s)]
*  Hi. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1170.88s)]
*  Yeah, so I'll just tell you, I mean, mostly we just... [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1171.88s)]
*  So I spoke to a chemist at the University of Mississippi and her name is Eden Tanner. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1174.76s)]
*  And what she and her colleagues have been doing is trying to find a novel treatment [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1179.52s)]
*  for glioblastoma. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1183.36s)]
*  That's an aggressive form of brain cancer that doesn't have a lot of good treatment [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1185.52s)]
*  options. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1189.72s)]
*  And their work, she told me, has nothing to do with race or gender or specific subpopulations. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1191.28s)]
*  No, there are no DEI aspects of the work itself at all. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1197.8s)]
*  Like I would like to cure brain cancer. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1202.64s)]
*  I think that's not particularly controversial. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1204.1599999999999s)]
*  But Eden and her colleague, the two lead investigators of the study, had gotten their grant through [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1206.72s)]
*  a special funding mechanism that set aside money for researchers from underrepresented [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1211.4399999999998s)]
*  groups. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1216.8799999999999s)]
*  Eden's colleague is black and Eden herself has a disability. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1217.8799999999999s)]
*  And so they qualified for this separate pool of money. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1222.12s)]
*  But it wasn't the only option available to them. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1226.1s)]
*  They could have applied through a more conventional request for proposals. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1228.88s)]
*  And based on the very high peer review scores they got, it seems likely that they could [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1234.5600000000002s)]
*  have been funded through other routes as well. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1239.2s)]
*  And it's been confusing in some ways for Eden. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1242.7600000000002s)]
*  To have work that's clearly not about DEI, gender ideology, to have work that is so clearly [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1245.16s)]
*  not that, be stopped. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1252.4s)]
*  It really feels like we're kind of an innocent bystander here. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1255.28s)]
*  Now Eden wanted to be clear that she didn't think that research that did focus on DEI [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1260.48s)]
*  or other hot button topics should be cut either. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1266.76s)]
*  But it was confusing for her because the research that she was doing, she thought, was the type [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1271.48s)]
*  of research that the administration wanted to prioritize. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1276.3999999999999s)]
*  We've heard about how much the administration wants to make America healthier again. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1280.6s)]
*  And that's what Eden thought that she and her colleagues were trying to do. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1286.52s)]
*  The work that we're doing has pretty clear importance to the general public. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1290.4399999999998s)]
*  And I think people should know that research that they probably would support is being [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1295.76s)]
*  canceled because of this broad brush that's being swept. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1299.9199999999998s)]
*  What happens to all these grants that have been eliminated now? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1304.48s)]
*  Is there a world in which these scientists get to keep doing the exact same research [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1309.88s)]
*  through other kinds of grants or applying for the money again, without using the key [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1315.0s)]
*  search terms that the administration doesn't want to see? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1322.0s)]
*  Can they just tailor their pitch to what the NIH wants under this administration? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1325.44s)]
*  Some can and some can't. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1334.6000000000001s)]
*  I talked to some scientists who really thought that they were caught up in some of this purely [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1337.2s)]
*  by accident. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1342.24s)]
*  For instance, they thought their study had been flagged because it included the word [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  diversity, but what they really meant was genetic diversity. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1348.32s)]
*  And so for them, it could be as simple as avoiding that phrase and talking about variance [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1352.64s)]
*  instead. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1359.52s)]
*  And that might be enough. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1360.66s)]
*  You can imagine for someone like Catherine Bogan, you can't really do that study without [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1362.36s)]
*  mentioning bisexual women. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1369.36s)]
*  And so some researchers, I think their topics of research just won't be acceptable to the [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1371.28s)]
*  NIH under this administration. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1377.8799999999999s)]
*  Some might be able to reapply and pick up where they left off, but others might have [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1380.8799999999999s)]
*  to change their research topics, leave their academic programs, or maybe even leave science [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1386.28s)]
*  altogether. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1392.84s)]
*  I want to talk about the agenda that the Trump administration is pursuing. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1394.96s)]
*  Obviously, we've said they're abandoning what they view as a political perspective in science [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1400.8799999999999s)]
*  that they don't like. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1408.6s)]
*  What are they replacing that with? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1410.24s)]
*  What is this new version of the NIH seeking when it comes to scientific research? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1412.04s)]
*  Well, we don't have a lot of data yet. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1416.8s)]
*  It's still early, so it'll be interesting to see how the next months and years unfold. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1419.56s)]
*  But we have seen some signals that priorities are definitely going to change. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1425.12s)]
*  The NIH recently reached an agreement with the FDA to begin funding more research on [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1432.0s)]
*  nutrition, including in particular ultra-processed foods, which is, we know, a priority for Robert [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1439.24s)]
*  F. Kennedy, Jr., the health secretary. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1446.1999999999998s)]
*  We've also heard reports from some news outlets that the NIH has sent out a request for research [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1449.3999999999999s)]
*  on transition regret. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1456.84s)]
*  So asking for studies on transgender people who have second thoughts about transitioning [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1459.72s)]
*  or negative consequences of transitioning, that seems to be something that the administration [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1467.64s)]
*  is actively seeking. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1473.24s)]
*  We've also heard about plans to study autism and a potential link to childhood vaccines, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1475.72s)]
*  which we know is another issue that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is passionate about. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1482.8000000000002s)]
*  There's now been a lot of research that debunks the idea that vaccines cause autism, but it [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1487.72s)]
*  seems like the administration wants to fund research that's going to reopen that question. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1493.36s)]
*  It seems pretty clear from what you're telling me that even though the administration kind [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1499.12s)]
*  of says that it's going after politically motivated science, it's not as though they're [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1505.0s)]
*  creating a world in which science is apolitical. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1510.6399999999999s)]
*  They're not taking the politics out of science. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1515.1999999999998s)]
*  They seem to be just infusing scientific grantmaking with their politics. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1517.36s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1523.7199999999998s)]
*  It's just a different politics that's driving science. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1524.7199999999998s)]
*  Do you think, Emily, that the administration had a point in any of what it's done thus [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  far in terms of the review of the grantmaking? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1537.56s)]
*  Is there an issue of scientists tailoring their studies to the politics of the moment [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1542.68s)]
*  and being too guided by what the culture really wanted? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1549.72s)]
*  Here's what is very clear from months of reporting and talking to scientific insiders, including [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1555.92s)]
*  people who are very supportive of the NIH and government funding. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1562.68s)]
*  Nobody thinks the NIH is perfect. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1569.52s)]
*  There is plenty of room for reform. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1571.48s)]
*  The NIH has been criticized for a long time for all sorts of things, for not taking enough [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1574.28s)]
*  risks or being innovative enough, for sending funds to the same researchers over and over [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1581.28s)]
*  again. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1587.24s)]
*  There are plenty of reforms that could be made. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1588.24s)]
*  I don't think scientists are disputing that, but I think scientists are nervous that these [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1591.96s)]
*  that are happening are not changes that are intended to produce good science. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1598.38s)]
*  It's interesting because in one sense, both sides of this, the Trump administration and [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1605.0600000000002s)]
*  the scientists and others who are upset about the way these cuts have happened, they're [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1609.94s)]
*  making similar claims that politics is influencing science on one side or the other. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1614.18s)]
*  But those who are angry about this have this other thing they're worried about, which [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1621.0800000000002s)]
*  is that they're saying this new direction, it isn't just political. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1627.08s)]
*  It also seems to be about specifically trying to gather evidence to confirm some preconceived [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1630.72s)]
*  notions. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1638.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's fair to say. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1639.2s)]
*  You can take a few of the examples that are actually at play here. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1643.12s)]
*  Most autism researchers say that they welcome more research into the causes of autism. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1647.64s)]
*  We don't know enough about that. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1654.08s)]
*  A lot of nutrition researchers welcome research into the potential dangers of ultra processed [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1656.04s)]
*  foods. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1662.4s)]
*  But it's one thing to approach those topics with intellectual honesty and an open mind [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1663.7s)]
*  and being led by the data. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1669.56s)]
*  And it's something else to approach them seeking a specific conclusion with that endpoint already [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1672.14s)]
*  in mind. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1678.36s)]
*  And I think that's what a lot of scientists are worried about happening now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1679.36s)]
*  Is there an apolitical science agenda? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1684.4s)]
*  Or is that actually not possible? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1687.76s)]
*  And is it more the case that when you're spending a finite amount of money, your choices are [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1692.2800000000002s)]
*  always going to be guided by whatever your values are and the NIH is no different? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1698.2s)]
*  The NIH is no different. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1704.2s)]
*  And there is no science without politics. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1706.0400000000002s)]
*  The questions you ask, the studies you fund, the topics you prioritize, all of those are [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1709.34s)]
*  reflections of politics, of values, of our societal concerns and priorities. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1716.1s)]
*  And so I don't think what scientists are asking for is a science without politics. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1723.78s)]
*  I think what they're nervous about is that the science itself becomes a servant of politics. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1729.98s)]
*  That the quality of research declines. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1738.8s)]
*  That research is solicited with sort of pre-imagined or predestined conclusions in mind. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1741.94s)]
*  And that science, as flawed as it is, has always been a way of at least crawling towards [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1750.26s)]
*  reaching for, groping for some larger objective truth. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1758.78s)]
*  And I think the concern now is that that entire process becomes so polluted that science loses [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1766.24s)]
*  a lot of what makes it so valuable. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1772.8799999999999s)]
*  Emily, thanks so much. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1783.1999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1785.9599999999998s)]
*  In the wake of two court rulings that take issue with the Trump administration's cuts [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1787.4s)]
*  to medical research, a senior official at the National Institutes of Health is directing [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1796.8400000000001s)]
*  the agency staff members not to cancel any more research projects, at least for now. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1802.0800000000002s)]
*  The internal memo was sent on Tuesday and is a retreat by the agency. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1808.96s)]

*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1834.24s)]
*  A NATO summit in the Netherlands ended on a high note for President Trump on Wednesday, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1836.24s)]
*  after America's European allies agreed to raise their spending on the military to 5% [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1841.04s)]
*  of their national income by 2035. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1847.2s)]
*  Trump has for years denigrated NATO allies as freeloaders and has pushed for them to [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1851.36s)]
*  increase military spending since his first term. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1855.92s)]
*  And this was a tremendous summit and I enjoyed it very much. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1859.36s)]
*  And thank you, I say to every one of those speeches. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1863.84s)]
*  After the announcement, Trump enthusiastically praised his European counterparts, saying [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1867.12s)]
*  he left the meeting thinking differently about an alliance he once threatened to abandon. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1872.08s)]
*  I left here saying that these people really love their countries, it's not a ripoff, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1877.76s)]
*  and we're here to help them protect their country. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1883.3999999999999s)]
*  But the accomplishment for Trump was overshadowed by questions that swirled about how much damage [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1886.1599999999999s)]
*  the U.S. had actually dealt to Iran's nuclear ambitions in its recent attack. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1891.3600000000001s)]

*  betraying the pilots who had bombed the Iranian enrichment plant called Fordow. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1906.8400000000001s)]
*  Trump had said those facilities had been obliterated. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1912.44s)]
*  What you can't do with nuclear weapons without a conversion facility, we can't even find [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1915.3600000000001s)]
*  where it is, where it used to be on the map. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1919.6s)]
*  You can't even find where it used to be because the whole thing is just blackened out, it's gone. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1921.6799999999998s)]
*  It's wiped out. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1925.12s)]

*  nuclear fuel into the form necessary to produce a nuclear weapon. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1937.6799999999998s)]
*  In the midst of all this on Wednesday, the head of the CIA offered a new assessment of [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1943.36s)]
*  the bombings, saying that based on new evidence, the damage to the Iranian nuclear program [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1947.92s)]
*  was in fact severe. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wol4KMqbYRo&t=1954.0800000000002s)]
