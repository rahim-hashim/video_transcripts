# A Frightening Moment to Fly
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=0.0s)]
*  A 90-second failure of Newark Airport's air traffic safety systems, which blacked out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=13.24s)]
*  communication to planes carrying thousands of passengers, has exposed a new level of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=18.16s)]
*  crisis in air travel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=23.5s)]
*  Today, my colleague Kate Kelly explains what the problems at one of the country's biggest [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=25.96s)]
*  airports tell us about air travel safety in the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=30.92s)]
*  It's Thursday, May 8th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=44.36s)]
*  Kate Kelly, welcome to The Daily. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=50.24s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Rachel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=51.96s)]
*  Kate, there have been a string of incidents in U.S. air travel in recent months that have [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=53.6s)]
*  really, I think, shaken consumer confidence in flying. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  For example, we had the deadliest plane crash in decades in the U.S. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=61.56s)]
*  Happened in January in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=66.2s)]
*  And then there have been all these reports of near misses, near collisions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=69.36s)]
*  And then finally now, most recently, we have this major failure in air traffic control [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=73.64s)]
*  systems in Newark. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=79.12s)]
*  We have talked on the show before about how aviation generally, the system is under a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=80.64s)]
*  lot of pressure in this country. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=85.88s)]
*  But what's happening with Newark feels like an even more of an escalation from the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=87.92s)]
*  problems that we've discussed before. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=92.84s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are wondering what on earth is going on and is it actually [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=95.16s)]
*  less safe to fly right now? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  It's a really great question, Rachel, and one that I've been asking myself and my [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=104.28s)]
*  colleagues, are we just paying more attention in the wake of the DCA crash to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=108.52s)]
*  issues, whether it's wing bumping or actual crashes in the national airspace, or are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  there actually more occurring? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Anecdotally, it certainly feels like the latter. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  But what I think has really caught people's attention are these issues at Newark [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  Liberty International Airport, which is one of the busiest in the national air system [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=131.96s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=136.64s)]
*  They had a major radar and radio outage on Monday, the 28th of April, that led to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=138.24s)]
*  essentially chaos for passengers and a public outcry among government officials and even [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=146.44s)]
*  among some controllers themselves that the system was not safe and was not necessarily [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=153.64s)]
*  reliable for all the people flying in and out of that airport. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=159.2s)]
*  So talk a little bit about that system failure more. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=163.36s)]
*  Like, what exactly happened? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=166.12s)]
*  Picture a relatively normal early afternoon at an air traffic control hub where you have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=172.08s)]
*  these air traffic controllers who essentially guide planes in and out of airports, sitting [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=179.72s)]
*  at workstations in front of what we call scopes, radar scopes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=185.12s)]
*  And this is kind of a circular screen that tells you within a certain diameter of airspace [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  which aircraft are flying in and out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=196.24s)]
*  So they're watching these, they have a headset and the headset is attached to a radio [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=199.44s)]
*  frequency through which they can have two way communications with pilots who are in [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  the air. So they're sitting there and out of nowhere, some of the radar scopes [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=210.12s)]
*  essentially go dark. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=216.84s)]
*  Not all of them, but some of them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=218.08s)]
*  And all of the radios go silent. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=226.56s)]
*  So they can't see the planes and they can't communicate with the pilots, correct? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=247.16s)]
*  So what happens then is one person starts shouting, I've lost my radar feed. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=256.12s)]
*  A supervisor rushes over to see what's going on. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=261.48s)]
*  Another controller grabs a landline telephone, calls colleagues in air traffic control who [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=265.48s)]
*  are based in Long Island and says, please hold your planes in the LaGuardia Airport [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=270.92s)]
*  airspace because I don't know if my planes are going to drift into your planes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=277.08s)]
*  I have no way to go. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  They lost three radar scopes went black. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=283.28s)]
*  They lost all the radios that approach. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  Just got told that approach lost all the radar, three of the four radar screens went [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  black and they have no frequency. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  And then at the same time, controllers gathered around one of the radar screens that was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=294.91999999999996s)]
*  functioning. And as it was described to me, they were not able to communicate with the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  pilots. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=304.55999999999995s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=305.55999999999995s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=307.55999999999995s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=309.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=311.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=313.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=315.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=317.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=319.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=321.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=323.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=325.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=327.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=329.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=331.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=333.6s)]
*  They were not able to communicate with the pilots. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=335.6s)]
*  Any idea how long or just whenever they figure it out? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  Whenever they figure it out, I've got no idea. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  After a while, the radio frequencies did return. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  Radio, 1951, how do you hear me? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=350.64000000000004s)]
*  I can actually loud and clear now, United 1951. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  Okay, turn right, maintain 2500, call the airport. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  And they were able to talk again to pilots. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=359.64000000000004s)]
*  7-M-R-262, we just lost our frequencies and radios for a minute everywhere. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=361.64000000000004s)]
*  So I think we're just going to have to cut you loose, VFR, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=365.68s)]
*  because we're stopping everything. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=368.68s)]
*  In case that happens again, so radar service. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=370.68s)]
*  We lost our radar and it's not working correctly. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=372.68s)]
*  Radar service terminates, squawk VFR, freeze change approved. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=374.68s)]
*  If you want a Bravo clearance, you can just call the towers and get closer. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=377.68s)]
*  Okay, I'll avoid for that frequency from you, okay? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=380.68s)]
*  Okay, no, just squawk VFR, look up the tower frequencies. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=384.68s)]
*  We don't have a radar, so I don't know where you are. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=387.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=389.68s)]
*  And a short while after that, they also got the radar back. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=391.72s)]
*  Contact, DOS 1169, we got them turning both ways. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=395.72s)]
*  DOS 1169, roger that, you are number four for departure. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=398.72s)]
*  Data 323, in the event of lost comm, the frequency is 12085. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=401.72s)]
*  2085 for lost comm, United 253. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=406.72s)]
*  What usually happens in these situations, and I think what happened here is [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=414.72s)]
*  other controllers who are in the building come and take over [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=418.76000000000005s)]
*  because the experience of those that have been on those positions [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=421.76000000000005s)]
*  is just so terrifying that they can't be expected to just pick right up on the work. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  And there was one person in the hallway apparently who was just trembling [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  and others who went home and cried and are having nightmares at this point. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=434.76000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, understandably. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=439.76000000000005s)]
*  I mean, this sounds like the scariest thing that could possibly happen to you [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=441.76000000000005s)]
*  in your entire career. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=443.76000000000005s)]
*  Yes, controllers have told me, Rachel, that this is the worst type of thing [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=445.8s)]
*  that can happen other than an actual crash. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=448.8s)]
*  How long did that outage last in total? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=451.8s)]
*  To the best of our understanding, the radio came back after roughly 30 seconds, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=454.8s)]
*  although to those who were in the room witnessing this, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=460.8s)]
*  apparently it felt like an eternity. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=463.8s)]
*  The displays took a little bit longer, so that was closer to a minute and a half. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=466.8s)]
*  Obviously a minute and a half does not sound like a long period of time, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  but can you just explain to us why that period of time could even matter? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  Ninety seconds is a long time when you consider the fact [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=480.84000000000003s)]
*  that these aircraft are supposed to be separated, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=483.84000000000003s)]
*  varying depending on their location and how close to landing or takeoff they are [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  by at least a couple of miles, two, three miles, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=490.84000000000003s)]
*  and at least a thousand vertical feet. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  So within 90 seconds, you could well see how just mathematically [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  you could have planes crashing into each other [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=500.88s)]
*  without proactive guidance from an air traffic controller. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=503.88s)]
*  So Kate, after the systems come back online, the radars, the scopes, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=506.88s)]
*  what kind of effect does this have on Newark? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=510.88s)]
*  So to the best of our understanding, flights were circling, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=513.88s)]
*  they were delayed in landing, they were delayed in taking off. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=516.88s)]
*  Clearly what had happened created a disruption [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=520.88s)]
*  and flights had been unable to proceed essentially, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=523.88s)]
*  so they tried to get those flights back on track. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=526.88s)]
*  But in the days that have followed, there have been flight cancellations, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=529.92s)]
*  there have been delays, passengers that colleagues of ours [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=533.92s)]
*  have talked to at the airport have been frustrated, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=537.92s)]
*  they said they're waiting on customer service calls for 45 minutes or an hour, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=540.92s)]
*  they don't know what to do, people broadly are nervous [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=544.92s)]
*  about flying in and out of Newark Airport, they're wondering if it's safe. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=547.92s)]
*  This has had a cascading effect of creating anxiety and mistrust in the public, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=551.92s)]
*  and it's unlikely that there's a quick fix. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=556.9599999999999s)]
*  OK, so let's talk about exactly what went wrong here. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=559.9599999999999s)]
*  Help me understand how this all happened. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I think the show has covered really well [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  some of the issues bedeviling the United States airspace [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=568.9599999999999s)]
*  and air traffic control in particular. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=572.9599999999999s)]
*  But in my opinion, Newark has become sort of this recent crucible [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=575.9599999999999s)]
*  for a combination of two pretty major strands fraying at the same time, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=579.9599999999999s)]
*  both technology that we all collectively rely on to keep air travel safe [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=584.0s)]
*  and staffing issues. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=588.0s)]
*  So all of that is combining for probably the most public, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=591.0s)]
*  most nerve-racking air travel disruption that we've seen in recent years. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=596.0s)]
*  It's all coming to a head at Newark basically. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=603.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=606.0s)]
*  Well, let's start with the technology piece of it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=607.0s)]
*  Can you just explain what exactly is going wrong with the technology [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=610.0s)]
*  at Newark? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=613.04s)]
*  Yeah, so start with the notion that system-wide [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=615.04s)]
*  the FAA is working with pretty dated technology. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=618.04s)]
*  Two lawmakers this week have referred to the fact [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=621.04s)]
*  that this Newark outage generated with a quote-unquote [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=624.04s)]
*  fried copper wire. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=627.04s)]
*  I haven't been able to verify that with government officials, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=629.04s)]
*  but it's been spoken of and written about [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=632.04s)]
*  and is probably a plausible metaphor, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=635.04s)]
*  if not a real explanation, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=638.04s)]
*  because you are dealing with copper wiring in a lot of these locations. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  Got it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  So even if copper wire didn't literally get fried here, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  the point that I think you're making is that this technology is old [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  and it's prone to breaking down. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  The other problem with this aged system [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  is that it's prone to hiccups and delays [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  that can make it extremely difficult at times [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=659.0799999999999s)]
*  for air traffic controllers to keep up with what is happening. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  The air traffic information they're getting [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  may not be real-time or may be frozen or interrupted [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=669.12s)]
*  by glitches along the line. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=673.12s)]
*  Just explain that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=675.12s)]
*  So the way that air traffic control works at a lot of airports [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=679.12s)]
*  might actually be different than what you think it is. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=682.12s)]
*  You might have an image of a bunch of people sitting in a tower [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=685.12s)]
*  at a place like Newark Airport [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=688.12s)]
*  with radar or maybe even with binoculars looking out the window [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=690.12s)]
*  and directing those flights in and out, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=694.12s)]
*  watching them land and take off from the runway. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=696.12s)]
*  That's actually not the full picture. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=699.12s)]
*  You do have people sitting in a tower at the airport, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=702.12s)]
*  but you also have a whole bunch of people sitting off-site [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=705.12s)]
*  in locations that might be dozens of miles away [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=709.12s)]
*  watching that air traffic as well [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=712.12s)]
*  and using radar scopes and two-way radio communications [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=714.12s)]
*  to guide those airplanes. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=718.12s)]
*  When it comes to Newark, for a long time, decades, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=720.12s)]
*  many of their air traffic controllers were working at a hub [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=724.12s)]
*  in Long Island in a town called Westbury, New York. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=728.16s)]
*  But last summer, the FAA decided to relocate [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=731.16s)]
*  a bunch of those people from Long Island to Philadelphia. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=734.16s)]
*  And in order to safely relocate those people to Philadelphia [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=738.16s)]
*  and make sure that they had the technology to do their jobs there, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=742.16s)]
*  the FAA did sort of a workaround for the data feeds [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=746.16s)]
*  that go from Newark Airport to Philadelphia. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=749.16s)]
*  Sorry, and just explain, what is a data feed exactly? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  Like, what are we talking about? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  So when you have planes in the air at Newark [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=757.1999999999999s)]
*  and you have flight plans and vectors, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=760.1999999999999s)]
*  meaning the angles at which airplanes come into the airport, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=763.1999999999999s)]
*  that all represents a whole lot of data. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  So the data that's generated from Newark Airport [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=770.1999999999999s)]
*  typically would be sent via copper wiring or broadband [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  to the air traffic control hub. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=778.24s)]
*  So rather than route that data straight from Newark to Philadelphia, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=780.24s)]
*  the FAA, for whatever reason, decided, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=785.24s)]
*  we'll keep our feed from Newark to Long Island [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=788.24s)]
*  and then we'll send it from Long Island to Philadelphia. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=791.24s)]
*  In and of itself, with fast transmission in this day and age, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=795.24s)]
*  that shouldn't be a problem. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=799.24s)]
*  But technology experts tell me it has grown a lot more [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=801.24s)]
*  and it's also made that Philadelphia data feed [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=805.28s)]
*  vulnerable to other hiccups in the system. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=808.28s)]
*  So basically it sounds like they added a pit stop [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=811.28s)]
*  along the way for this data, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=814.28s)]
*  but that pit stop seems like it came with more opportunities [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=816.28s)]
*  for failure, is that right? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=819.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=821.28s)]
*  And we saw a manifestation of that potential for failure [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=822.28s)]
*  last September 2nd. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=826.28s)]
*  And what happened was that the data feed [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=828.28s)]
*  was not going to be as good as it was. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=831.28s)]
*  And what happened was that several of the radar scopes [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=834.3199999999999s)]
*  in the Philadelphia location [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  where the newer controllers were working froze up. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=839.3199999999999s)]
*  Wow, so wait, they actually had another outage [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  before this latest one? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=845.3199999999999s)]
*  Like this isn't the first time this has happened? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=846.3199999999999s)]
*  So there have been three outages that we know of, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=849.3199999999999s)]
*  including the one that occurred last week. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  The first one I'll come back to in a second [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=854.3199999999999s)]
*  because it's sort of a horse of a different color, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  but the one I was mentioning, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=858.3199999999999s)]
*  it resulted from the sort of pit stop idea [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=860.3199999999999s)]
*  that we were talking about. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=863.36s)]
*  It essentially related to the fact [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=864.36s)]
*  that this data was traveling a little bit further [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=866.36s)]
*  and the data stream that feeds into these Newark [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=869.36s)]
*  air traffic controller screens [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=872.36s)]
*  was affected by data issues at a different local airport [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=875.36s)]
*  that were sort of overstressing the system. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=879.36s)]
*  And what was the third outage that you mentioned [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=882.36s)]
*  that you said was kind of different? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=884.36s)]
*  So that one was a more significant disruption. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=886.36s)]
*  It occurred last August 27th. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=889.36s)]
*  And what happened there was that an outside vendor [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=892.4s)]
*  working for the FAA accidentally clipped [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=895.4s)]
*  or unplugged literally a feed of data. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=899.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=902.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=903.4s)]
*  So you could hear the air traffic controller [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=904.4s)]
*  who was dealing with the downed technology [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=907.4s)]
*  saying, attention all aircraft, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=910.4s)]
*  radar contact is lost. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=912.4s)]
*  Radar contact is lost. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=914.4s)]
*  When you listen to the audio recordings from that day. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=916.4s)]
*  That was another 90 second outage. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=919.4s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it should be that easy [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=922.4s)]
*  to cause such a dangerous system failure. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=924.4s)]
*  The idea that like one guy pulls out the wrong plug. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=926.4s)]
*  Like should there be some sort of, I don't know, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=930.4s)]
*  safety net to prevent that from happening? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=932.4s)]
*  Yeah, I remember somebody who was around at the time [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=935.4s)]
*  told me they don't even necessarily care [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=938.4s)]
*  what the exact causes are of this outage. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=941.4s)]
*  Whether it's someone with a big pair of scissors [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=944.4s)]
*  or someone knocking a plug out of the wall. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=946.4s)]
*  Regardless, this should be the Fort Knox of aviation data. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=949.4399999999999s)]
*  In other words, this should be an impenetrable system [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  with multiple backups that is never permitted to fail. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, Kate, I have to say, even though I've been [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  obviously an avid listener of The Daily [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=962.4399999999999s)]
*  and consumer of The New York Times, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=964.4399999999999s)]
*  I had no idea that the technology issues [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  in air travel were this bad and this terrifying. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel, the technology really is problematic. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=973.4399999999999s)]
*  But where you have a toxic combination here [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=977.48s)]
*  is when you throw in the fact that Newark [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=980.48s)]
*  has already been struggling for a while now [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=982.48s)]
*  with chronic staffing shortages. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=985.48s)]
*  And all of that is impeding [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=988.48s)]
*  these controllers' ability to function. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=990.48s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=993.52s)]
*  So Kate, before the break, you did a great job [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1005.52s)]
*  in getting the information out to the public [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1007.52s)]
*  about the new technology. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1009.52s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1011.52s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1013.52s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1015.52s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed it. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1017.52s)]
*  I hope you enjoyed it. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1019.52s)]
*  So Kate, before the break, you'd mentioned [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1021.56s)]
*  that there have been staffing issues [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1023.56s)]
*  within air travel and specifically at Newark. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1026.56s)]
*  So can you talk a little bit about that? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1029.56s)]
*  What has been going on with staffing [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1031.56s)]
*  at Newark specifically? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1033.56s)]
*  Yeah, so as your listeners know, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1035.56s)]
*  because you guys have talked about this, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1037.56s)]
*  there have been air traffic controller shortages nationwide. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1039.56s)]
*  So why has Newark been a particular crux of the problem? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1043.56s)]
*  It has to do with the complexity of it [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1048.56s)]
*  and the amount of experience that's needed and expected. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1050.6s)]
*  So if you want to become an air traffic controller, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1053.6s)]
*  you would start with a training process in Oklahoma City, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1056.6s)]
*  which is where the FAA's academy is. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1060.6s)]
*  You would have had to apply for that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1062.6s)]
*  and be admitted to the program. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1064.6s)]
*  Then after that, you would probably go [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1066.6s)]
*  to a pretty light airspace, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1068.6s)]
*  at least relative to these New York City airspaces, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1070.6s)]
*  Fargo, North Dakota, for example. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1074.6s)]
*  And maybe you would do that for a couple of years [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1076.6s)]
*  and maybe after that, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1078.6399999999999s)]
*  you would do something like Indianapolis, Indiana. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1079.6399999999999s)]
*  And then after you had done that for a while, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1082.6399999999999s)]
*  you might eventually work your way up [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1084.6399999999999s)]
*  to an airspace like Newark. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  But even when you arrived at Newark, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1087.6399999999999s)]
*  even if you were coming from a major airport like O'Hare, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1089.6399999999999s)]
*  you would still need to train for roughly a year [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  to learn all the nuances and all the techniques [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1095.6399999999999s)]
*  associated with that Newark airspace. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  So even if today the FAA identified 10 new people [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1101.6399999999999s)]
*  that it wanted to send to do air traffic control at Newark, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  that would be a year, give or take, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1107.68s)]
*  before they'd be ready. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1109.68s)]
*  In other words, just because you say, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1110.68s)]
*  okay, we're going to give you the money [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1112.68s)]
*  to hire 10 new people, 100 new people, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1114.68s)]
*  that does not mean that you have 10 or 100 new people [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1116.68s)]
*  that are ready tomorrow to take a job at Newark, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1119.68s)]
*  one of the busiest airports in the country. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1122.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1124.68s)]
*  And these staffing issues at Newark are not new. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1125.68s)]
*  In fact, part of the reason [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1128.68s)]
*  that these people we're talking about [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1130.68s)]
*  were relocated to Philadelphia in the first place [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1132.68s)]
*  was to solve for a problem [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1135.72s)]
*  that Newark controllers were having with low personnel. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1136.72s)]
*  They had been working in Long Island for many years [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1140.72s)]
*  controlling this Newark airspace from Long Island. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1143.72s)]
*  And there were ongoing issues recruiting [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1146.72s)]
*  and retaining people who could work that airspace. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1150.72s)]
*  Some of it had to do with cost of living. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1153.72s)]
*  Long Island, New York area, an expensive place to live, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1155.72s)]
*  an expensive place to try to buy a house or raise a family. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1158.72s)]
*  So it spent several years [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1162.72s)]
*  trying to convince controllers and their union [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1163.76s)]
*  that they should move to Philadelphia. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1165.76s)]
*  The FAA reasoned that with the lower cost of living [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1167.76s)]
*  in the Philadelphia area, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1170.76s)]
*  they might be able to recruit and retain more people. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1171.76s)]
*  So that move to Philadelphia, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1174.76s)]
*  did that help with the staffing issues ultimately? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1176.76s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1179.76s)]
*  And to be fair to the FAA, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1180.76s)]
*  it was always going to be a long-term play [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1183.76s)]
*  given this kind of long pipeline we were just talking about. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1186.76s)]
*  But it was a long-term play [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1189.76s)]
*  but a variety of issues have meant [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1192.8s)]
*  that their numbers are actually down at this point. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1194.8s)]
*  So let me just walk you through it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1197.8s)]
*  For a long time, the FAA had set the air traffic controller [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1200.8s)]
*  target associated with this Newark space at over 60 people. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1203.8s)]
*  63 is the number that I heard. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1207.8s)]
*  But around the time that they proposed [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1211.8s)]
*  and undertook this move of people to Philadelphia, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1213.8s)]
*  they changed the target to something like 42 [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1216.8s)]
*  air traffic controllers. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1219.8s)]
*  That would be a full staff for controlling Newark airspace [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1220.84s)]
*  from this particular hub. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1224.84s)]
*  But wait, initially they said that they needed [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1225.84s)]
*  60-something controllers [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1228.84s)]
*  and now the FAA is saying they only need 42. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1229.84s)]
*  Why did they change that? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1232.84s)]
*  I don't have a clear explanation for that [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1233.84s)]
*  and controllers think it's strange. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1235.84s)]
*  But they lowered their expectations at some stage in time [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1238.84s)]
*  maybe because they were just trying to be pragmatic [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1241.84s)]
*  about the numbers that they had. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1244.84s)]
*  Now, almost a year into this relocation, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1245.8799999999999s)]
*  the FAA now says they have 22 people [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1248.8799999999999s)]
*  who are fully certified to work the airspace. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1251.8799999999999s)]
*  But let me put that in context for you. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  So according to a government document [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1256.8799999999999s)]
*  about staffing that I've reviewed, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1259.8799999999999s)]
*  a full day shift, an eight-hour shift [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  should be 10 people [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1264.8799999999999s)]
*  and a night shift should be 14 people. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1266.8799999999999s)]
*  At the time of this radar outage that we're talking about, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1269.8799999999999s)]
*  you have a full staff. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1272.8799999999999s)]
*  So basically what you're saying is that [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1273.92s)]
*  at the time of this outage, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1275.92s)]
*  they had a third of the people that they actually need [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1276.92s)]
*  to run air traffic control [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1280.92s)]
*  at a super busy time at Newark. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1282.92s)]
*  Yeah, under normal staffing guidelines, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1284.92s)]
*  that's what they would have. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1286.92s)]
*  Given the numbers of the air traffic controllers [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1293.92s)]
*  that are actually working the airspace, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1295.92s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1298.92s)]
*  Given the numbers of the air traffic controllers [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1299.96s)]
*  that are actually working at Newark, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1301.96s)]
*  is there a safe number of flights [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1303.96s)]
*  that can fly in and out? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1305.96s)]
*  Like how many planes ideally should be going in and out [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1307.96s)]
*  of that airport if there's only four people [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1309.96s)]
*  who are working at any given time? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1312.96s)]
*  Well, let me tell you what the CEO of United Airlines [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1314.96s)]
*  says about this. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1317.96s)]
*  He's working in close contact with the FAA. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1318.96s)]
*  He wrote in a letter today, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1320.96s)]
*  in ideal weather with full staffing [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1322.96s)]
*  and with perfectly functioning technology, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1324.96s)]
*  the FAA tells us that the airport [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1327.0s)]
*  can only handle 77 flights per hour. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1329.0s)]
*  And yet the FAA regularly approves schedules [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1332.0s)]
*  of 80 plus flights per hour almost every day [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1335.0s)]
*  between 3 and 8 p.m. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1338.0s)]
*  This math doesn't work. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1339.0s)]
*  So then what's the role of the government here? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1341.0s)]
*  Like at what point is the FAA supposed to come in [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1344.0s)]
*  and say, this is not safe. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1347.0s)]
*  You can't fly. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1349.0s)]
*  You do not have enough people for these planes [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1350.0s)]
*  to land and take off safely. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1352.0s)]
*  Like, isn't that the whole point of the FAA? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1354.0s)]
*  At a certain point, the FAA will say that [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1356.04s)]
*  when enough controllers don't show up for work [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1362.04s)]
*  for whatever reason, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1364.04s)]
*  they have what are called staffing triggers [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1366.04s)]
*  and they just can't run the airspace. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1368.04s)]
*  They either have to dramatically reduce the number of flights [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1370.04s)]
*  that can come in and out on that day [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1373.04s)]
*  or they have to engage in a ground stop. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1375.04s)]
*  One famous example of this occurred in 2019 [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1377.04s)]
*  when there was a government shutdown [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1380.04s)]
*  and about 10 controllers in different states [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1382.04s)]
*  and about 10 controllers in different spots [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1385.08s)]
*  around the country called in sick on a given day [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1387.08s)]
*  and the political pressure with stranded passengers [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1389.08s)]
*  and canceled flights became so great [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1392.08s)]
*  that the government essentially reopened. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1395.08s)]
*  So there are cases in which the staffing is just so low [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1397.08s)]
*  that the FAA says, Basta, we can't continue flying. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1401.08s)]
*  They are case by case periodically slowing flights [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1404.08s)]
*  or grounding flights, but to my knowledge, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1408.08s)]
*  they haven't proactively cut off the number of flights [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1410.08s)]
*  that can come in and out of Newark right now. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1414.12s)]
*  Okay, so just to be clear, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1416.12s)]
*  we know there have come points where the FAA has said, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1417.12s)]
*  these conditions are not safe, you're not allowed to fly [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1421.12s)]
*  and we know that that hasn't happened at Newark [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1424.12s)]
*  but we don't actually know where the line is. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1426.12s)]
*  Do I have that right? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1428.12s)]
*  You do. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1429.12s)]
*  So given the fact that the FAA [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1430.12s)]
*  isn't actually pulling the emergency break, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1432.12s)]
*  people can't just be expected to continue [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1435.12s)]
*  with the status quo at Newark, right? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1437.12s)]
*  So is anybody proposing any kind of solutions? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1439.12s)]
*  Yeah, so transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1441.1599999999999s)]
*  who just came in in January, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  has been pretty outspoken about this in general [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1446.1599999999999s)]
*  and in recent days. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1449.1599999999999s)]
*  He has said that the technology is antiquated. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1451.1599999999999s)]
*  He has said that we need to move far ahead [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  in terms of modernizing that technology. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1456.1599999999999s)]
*  He also wants to solve for the staffing problems. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1459.1599999999999s)]
*  He's already introduced some enhanced pay and incentives [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1461.1599999999999s)]
*  for people to consider joining the FAA as controllers [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1465.1599999999999s)]
*  and they seem like they're committed to cutting red tape, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1469.2s)]
*  investing where necessary, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1472.2s)]
*  putting in better technology and so on. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1474.2s)]
*  So I think the momentum and the commitment [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1476.2s)]
*  are there in theory and I think they may be able to move [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1478.2s)]
*  more expeditiously than some of their forebears. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1482.2s)]
*  On the other hand, these are not quick fixes. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1485.2s)]
*  Maybe they'll come up with some innovative ideas [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1488.2s)]
*  for bringing in new, fresh talent and fast tracking them [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1490.2s)]
*  but they can only track them so fast. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1495.2s)]
*  And if the technology is not backed up and consistent, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1497.24s)]
*  it's not going to help anyone. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1501.24s)]
*  Kate, I feel like as journalists, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1503.24s)]
*  when you see a major failure like what happened at Newark [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1505.24s)]
*  within a system that more broadly we know has problems, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1507.24s)]
*  I feel like our first instinct is to assume [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1511.24s)]
*  this is probably not the only really big problem here [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1513.24s)]
*  and so I guess the question becomes, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1519.24s)]
*  are there more Newarks around the country? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1521.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a fair question [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1524.28s)]
*  and one that I can't readily answer. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1526.28s)]
*  I do know something about air traffic control, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1529.28s)]
*  for example, in Washington, D.C. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1532.28s)]
*  and it's absolutely got its own set of challenges [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1534.28s)]
*  and while staffing has been a problem there too, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1537.28s)]
*  they have a totally separate issue [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1540.28s)]
*  which is just the complexity of their airspace [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1542.28s)]
*  with helicopters flying in and out [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1544.28s)]
*  and that became the issue [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1546.28s)]
*  during this terrible crash in January. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1548.28s)]
*  So I think that's a big issue [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1550.28s)]
*  and I'm not sure if it's still going to be [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1552.32s)]
*  in the same situation in the same way [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1554.32s)]
*  that it was with the crash in January. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1556.32s)]
*  So I think what's tricky about this conversation [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1558.32s)]
*  is every airport, every airspace, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1560.32s)]
*  is nuanced in its own way. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1563.32s)]
*  That's why these controllers spend years even [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1565.32s)]
*  getting up to par on the place where they're working [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1569.32s)]
*  but it's a very valid question. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1572.32s)]
*  I mean, it's sort of interesting to note here [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1575.32s)]
*  that in the past, if you were a nervous flyer [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1577.32s)]
*  it's much more dangerous to be in a car [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1580.36s)]
*  but now it feels like to be nervous [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1582.36s)]
*  is normal just from reading the news. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1585.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's rational. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1589.36s)]
*  But I also think statistically, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1591.36s)]
*  aviation is safe, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1593.36s)]
*  the FAA does have basic guardrails [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1595.36s)]
*  that we need to rely on them to put in place [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1597.36s)]
*  and even in this case, the airline [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1599.36s)]
*  that is a major user of this particular airport [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1601.36s)]
*  is telling us we're keeping safety first and foremost, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1604.36s)]
*  we're dialing back some of our operations here [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1608.3999999999999s)]
*  and we're going to lean on the FAA to do more as well. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1610.3999999999999s)]
*  Right, as nerve-racking as it is to maybe read the news [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1613.3999999999999s)]
*  and maybe to listen to this episode [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1616.3999999999999s)]
*  it's still probably important to remember [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1618.3999999999999s)]
*  that air travel still remains overwhelmingly safe [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1620.3999999999999s)]
*  and frankly probably still much safer [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1623.3999999999999s)]
*  than getting in a car. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1625.3999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1627.3999999999999s)]
*  What about you, Kate? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1628.3999999999999s)]
*  Like I'm just sort of curious, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1630.3999999999999s)]
*  you've been covering these issues for weeks now. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  Have your personal feelings about air travel changed? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1633.3999999999999s)]
*  Are you more nervous? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1636.44s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1638.44s)]
*  And I have to say I'm not a nervous flyer [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1639.44s)]
*  but I've had a hard time flying out of Washington, Reagan [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1641.44s)]
*  since the crash in January that I've been covering [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1646.44s)]
*  just because I know how complex that aerospace is [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1649.44s)]
*  and I know that they too are dealing with staffing shortages. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1652.44s)]
*  In terms of Newark, I don't fly them a lot [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1656.44s)]
*  but I was in a group chat recently with some people [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1659.44s)]
*  who were involved in a trip out of Newark. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1662.44s)]
*  And I was really uncertain of how to reply. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1667.4s)]
*  I have my own opinions, which is that the system is stressed right now [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1672.4s)]
*  and I do know of some of the particular challenges that Newark has. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1675.4s)]
*  At the time though, I really didn't know any more than the other people knew. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1681.4s)]
*  And as we used to say when I worked at the Wall Street Journal [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1686.4s)]
*  and we were covering the beginning of the financial crisis, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1689.4s)]
*  you don't cry fire in a crowded theater. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1692.4s)]
*  If you don't have a specific and credible reason [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1695.4s)]
*  to tell people that a crisis is afoot, you don't say it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1699.4s)]
*  Because it's not fair and it's not ethical to alarm members of the public, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1703.4s)]
*  even your friends and family, if you don't know for sure that there's an issue. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1708.4s)]
*  It basically sounds like you're saying we should not be calling fire yet. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1713.4s)]
*  No, I'm not. I'm not. Let's see how this plays out. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1716.4s)]
*  Do you have any trips planned? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1721.4s)]
*  Yes, I'm actually out of town right now and I will be returning to New York to LaGuardia. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1723.4s)]
*  Kate, thank you so much. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1734.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1735.4s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1747.4s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1754.4s)]
*  Three former police officers were acquitted of charges including second degree murder [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1757.4s)]
*  in the beating death of Tyree Nichols back in 2023. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1761.4s)]
*  The killing sparked nationwide outrage and was held up as an example of police brutality against a black man. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1766.4s)]
*  Nichols, a FedEx employee, was pulled over by the officers who used pepper spray and a stun gun on him [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1773.4s)]
*  before chasing him down and beating him after he broke free and started running to his mother's house. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1779.4s)]
*  And the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday for a third meeting in a row [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1786.4s)]
*  as officials pointed to heightened uncertainty about how significantly President Trump's tariffs [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1792.4s)]
*  will raise inflation and slow growth. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1797.4s)]
*  While the Fed acknowledged the labor market was still solid in a statement, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1800.4s)]
*  policymakers also noted uncertainty about the future economic outlook [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1804.4s)]
*  and that the risks of higher unemployment and inflation have risen. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1808.4s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Mary Wilson, Jessica Chung, and Michael Simon Johnson. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1819.4s)]
*  It was edited by MJ Davis Lynn and Devin Taylor. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1825.4s)]
*  It contains original music by Rowan Neemisto, Alicia P. Etup, and Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1828.4s)]
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderly. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1835.4s)]
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Rachel Abrams. See you tomorrow. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1851.4s)]
*  you [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0RFz_T_kY8&t=1858.4s)]
