# 'The Interview' Sally Rooney Thinks Career Growth Is Overrated
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3OcgDhOYSM)
*  From the New York Times, this is The Interview. I'm David Marchese.
*  The arrival of Sally Rooney's new novel, Intermezzo, this month is absolutely one of the fall's
*  biggest publishing events. Not only for all the readers hungry for new fiction from the
*  33-year-old Irish author, and that includes myself, but for all the book lovers, again
*  myself included, eager for the flood of think pieces and commentary that Intermezzo will
*  surely spawn. Rooney is one of those rare authors who's been able to earn a mass readership
*  as well as serious critical attention. Maybe I should just say attention period. The popular
*  success is, on some level, easier to understand. Her four novels are beautifully written relationship
*  studies, someone else might dare call them romances, that weave together politics, sex,
*  moral philosophy, dry humor, and a distinctly millennial unease with the state of the world.
*  It's a compelling combo, one that found an even broader fan base after her first two
*  novels, Conversations with Friends and Normal People, were adapted into buzzy TV series.
*  The lightning rod aspect to Rooney and her work is a little more mysterious. I'm sure
*  any writer who gets held up like Rooney does as the voice of a generation is sure to be
*  scrutinized, but the outsized amount and the intensity of both the praise and the criticism
*  of her output feels a little confusing, including to Rooney, who as she told me, would much
*  rather let her work speak for itself. And yet, here's my conversation with Sally Rooney.
*  I was just reading a brief interview you did with The New Yorker that ran in conjunction
*  with an excerpt from Intermezzo. And I think in there it said that you said that it's stressful
*  to publish your work and maybe even more stressful to wait for it to be published.
*  Why is that? Because I can imagine that this is the nice time before you have to worry
*  about how people are actually responding to it or if it's selling or anything. Now it's
*  like you just got the thing ready to go.
*  Yeah. But the way that books are published means that actually a lot of the stuff that
*  I find stressful is kind of front-loaded. So it happens that, of course, the conversation
*  that we're having right now and the conversations that I'll be having with other journalists
*  about the book will be happening before the book is ever published. And that means that
*  the part that involves me, in a sense, putting myself out there and trying to work out a
*  way of talking about my book happens before the public has had a chance to read it. And
*  so it's just a weird mental space to be in. I feel like everything that I had to say went
*  into the book and I have nothing left to give that isn't already in the text.
*  Do you recall if it's ever happened where you've paid attention to the discourse around
*  the book and then had the thought like, oh, I wish I had a chance to respond to that?
*  I try, and this may sound insincere, but hand on heart, I do actually try not to look at
*  the discourse around my work. Of course, some of it filters through and people will just
*  like tell me what, you know, things that are being said about my work or whatever.
*  But I do my best not to look at it too much because I think it would lead me down a bad
*  path. And then do I ever feel like responding to it? No, I don't think so. I don't need
*  to be over the reader's shoulder saying, what do you think of that page? I need to kind
*  of accept that at that point my work is done, be it good or bad, and let the reader or the
*  critic have their own conversation.
*  You know, maybe this will be a preview of ways in which people might respond to the
*  new book. But the first question I had about Intermezzo is to do with the fact that the
*  two main protagonists, the brothers Ivan and Peter, are obviously guys. And obviously there
*  was Connell and normal people was a protagonist of that book. But Ivan and Peter really seem
*  central in a way that men haven't been in your books. And I'm curious if you felt it
*  was a particular challenge to write from a male perspective.
*  Yeah, interestingly, the first voice that came to the page for me in this project was
*  Margaret's voice. So the character who becomes entangled in Ivan's life in the course of
*  the book. So it certainly wasn't that I sat down thinking time to write a book about men,
*  you know, I have to write a book where the male voice is central or anything like that.
*  I thought that it was going to be Margaret's story. Of course, I knew that Ivan was a big
*  part of that story. But his sort of voice came along rather late in the writing process.
*  So it definitely was not a conscious project of trying to write about men or trying to
*  write about masculinity. I just felt my way through the story that seemed to emerge when
*  I encountered these characters and I kind of followed where they led me, which is what
*  I always try to do. Of course, then I had moments of self-reflection and self-consciousness
*  because I was thinking, what do I know, you know, anything about what I'm writing about?
*  But on the other hand, I think, and again, this is from just having said that I try to
*  ignore all discourse about my work. Nonetheless, it has permeated through.
*  It filters through that I'm aware that people think that my work is heavily autobiographical
*  and in fact it isn't. So it felt like they were just fictional characters like all my
*  other fictional characters and I was intrigued by them. I found them really interesting.
*  I liked being with them on the page. And so the question of gender felt very secondary
*  and it certainly wasn't a conscious theme that I was trying to explore or say something
*  about as it were. But there were moments where I thought, have I got any of this right and
*  am I overstepping myself or something?
*  This is not a spoiler or anything, but Peter and Ivan have lost their father. And I was
*  curious about your experience of grief and if in that instance you were writing from
*  personal reflection or if you weren't, did you feel like it was a particularly difficult
*  task to write into a feeling that deep that you had not experienced?
*  I think that's a fair question, but I've never been conscious in writing about any
*  emotional experience that any of my characters have had of drawing on something that I have
*  felt or known in my own life. The relationship between fiction and the life of the author
*  is a very live relationship in the minds of readers and critics and it's a completely
*  unknown relationship in my life. I never ever think about it. Only when I publish a book
*  do I ever even have to wonder what the relationship between my fiction and my own life is.
*  I sometimes feel that my work is like a little bit like what it might be like to be an actor.
*  Like I get very into character and I inhabit that consciousness and that allows me to write
*  about what it is that the character is undergoing. And I'm not in any way saying to myself,
*  well, I know that it would be like this because I remember when something analogous happened to me
*  and I felt like this. And I think if I caught myself doing that, I think there was something
*  wrong with the way that I was working. I think at the moment that I found myself reaching for such
*  a thing, I would think there's something I've lost touch with my character in some way.
*  I'm not going to belabor this because there's a lot of other things I want to ask you about,
*  but do you find yourself having thoughts about the writers that are meaningful to you that it
*  seems like people have about you and your work? No. And curiously.
*  So you've never read a biography of a novelist you liked or something like that?
*  I've actually never read a biography of a writer. I've never. And I went.
*  There's some good ones. And people say that there are.
*  And I recommended them on a regular basis. And I think I must have some kind of mental block
*  to reading them. Of course, there are, let's say, natural gaps in my reading.
*  Like I wish there weren't. But I think this is more than a gap. I think it's like a resistance.
*  It's something that is like a stubborn lack of curiosity in me. I don't tend to wonder
*  about the relationship between the writer's life and the writer's work.
*  And yeah, I think that part of that is.
*  I was going to say part of it might be responsive to a sense that that's an imposed relationship
*  that comes from outside and that I want to resist engaging in that. But I think part of it is a
*  genuine lack of interest, because before I ever became a published writer, I also didn't read
*  writers biographies or even really know anything about writers. I would know what period they lived
*  in, but I would not know anything about it. That's it. Yeah, that's kind of it. And I'm still a
*  little bit like that. So I think and maybe that's why I struggle to answer the kind of questions
*  that you are very reasonably asking, because I don't read work in that way. Yeah. Then do you
*  have or what might the apprehensions be about sharing your political views? You've written
*  about being against the war in Gaza, for example, or abortion in Ireland, you know. So it seems
*  if you're willing to do that, surely you're aware that making your opinions known about these kinds
*  of divisive issues, you know, sort of like opening up the possibility that people might conflate
*  Sally Rooney and her your your work. How do you think about that? Well, that to me feels like
*  a different avenue of conversation. And it's interesting that to you, those two things feel
*  quite close. And to me, they feel quite different. So I'm interested by that. And I'm actually struck
*  by that. I think to an extent, when we talk about having spoken out against the war in Gaza,
*  having written as I did about the housing crisis in Ireland, having written obviously about abortion
*  a couple of years ago now in the Irish context, I feel that I have been given a very privileged
*  position in public discourse, particularly in Ireland. I feel that I have the power to
*  intervene in public conversations. And I still feel disinclined to do it unless I feel that there
*  might be something that I could contribute that I haven't seen said elsewhere. And so in cases like
*  that, I do feel that there is something like, for some reason, I'm not, I don't want to use the words
*  moral duty, but I do feel a little bit of an obligation. And then how that relates to my work,
*  I think that my fiction is politically committed in a sense. I do think that my
*  political beliefs are rooted in commitment to the dignity of human life. The avenue through which
*  I have ended up theorizing that universality of human dignity and, you know, human rights
*  is through a sort of Marxist framework. And I suppose that I do feel that that's present in my
*  fiction, not that I feel that anybody who picks up one of my books is going to get a political
*  ideology from that or is going to agree with me about political points they didn't agree with me
*  on before they started reading it. So I suppose not didactic in that sense, but that those
*  commitments run through my work. But what's interesting to me is that you raise the question
*  of whether that invites people to read my work in a personal way. And I think,
*  but what does that have to do with anything? I mean, I feel like my political work is there in
*  public and I can stand by it and I'm happy to discuss it. And my fiction is the same and it's
*  there and I share it with the public and I'm happy to talk about it. And that all feels very separate
*  from my personal life, which I never want to talk about and doesn't feel like it has anything to do
*  with my work. So I think that those feel like three separate things to me. Two of them I can
*  talk about in different ways and for different reasons. And then the third one I can't or don't
*  want to. But I understand why to you they feel interlinked. And I think that does make sense.
*  There are stylistic aspects to Intermezzo that make it different from your past books.
*  But of course, in another way, it's not that different. People have intense relationships
*  and they're sort of drawn together, kept apart from each other, trying to get back to each other.
*  They set it up with the term would be socio-cultural setting is not wildly different.
*  I guess the way I think about it is really any character from any one of your novels
*  could walk into another one of those novels and you wouldn't be like, what the hell is that person
*  doing here? You know, they would sort of fit. Do you ever wonder if your books are too similar
*  and do you think about how you're writing might change in the future?
*  I think that's a really good question. And I would have to answer it by saying I don't
*  care about my career. So I don't think about my work as belonging to me even really. I think
*  about when I'm writing a project, how do I make this book the perfect version of what it can be?
*  I've got these characters and I feel like they've walked into my life. That's a kind of gift.
*  And I love being with them. And I never think about it in relation to my other work. And I
*  never think about what people will say about how close or how distant it is from my oeuvre. And I
*  don't think of myself as even having an oeuvre. I don't think about those questions at all.
*  And I don't feel myself thinking about my growth as an artist, if you will.
*  I'm skeptical that you don't think about that.
*  Yeah, no, I think it's fair to be skeptical. And I think that there is a huge cultural fixation
*  with novelty and growth. Like I mean, our whole economic system is obviously built on constant,
*  permanent, ceaseless growth. We all have to grow. Everything has to grow all the time.
*  Get bigger, sell more and be different. Novelty, reinvention. Those are like the
*  principles of our present culture, almost it feels like. And I don't find that very interesting.
*  I feel like I am so grateful when I get a new idea for a project. And by new, I just mean it has new
*  characters in it. And to me, I know when you say one of my characters could walk into another of
*  my novels, perhaps that is true, but they haven't. So there is no Ivan in any of my previous books.
*  He is a new guy. And for me, like that's enough. But I do understand that people might feel,
*  she's repeating herself because it's just another book about people, same age range, same milieu.
*  They're in, some of them are in Dublin, some of them are in the west of Ireland,
*  and they're traveling back and forth and having these relationships. And there is sex and there's
*  talking and they have political beliefs or whatever. Like that's, yeah, that is all my books.
*  And perhaps it always will be. I don't know. I guess I would say, and I'm wary of saying this
*  because it could sound like I'm trying to compare myself to the great masters of the past. And I
*  absolutely am not. But I suppose what I would say is that when I look at writers whose work has
*  transformed my life, I look at the work of Austin, I look at the work of Henry James, even Dostoevsky.
*  Those writers produced work that very much adheres to what you're describing, where it feels like a
*  figure from one of their books could stroll into any of the other novels that they wrote and be
*  very much at home. But each of the novels is its own just world and it's intense and it's profound
*  and it's beautiful. And of course, that's what I'm striving for. I want to ask sort of a question
*  more to do with formal qualities of your work. You know, beautiful world, where are you? Obviously,
*  you were trying things out with, I don't even know the way to phrase it, like not conveying
*  interiority in big sections of that book. And in Intermezzo, the Peter sections are,
*  there's sort of like a stream of consciousness feel to them. Like do those sort of formal
*  experiments, do they come out of character? Or do you have the thought, you know, this is something
*  I would like to try formally and here is an opportunity to do it? I think it's the former.
*  I think they strictly come out of not only character but a scenario. So I think often at
*  the beginning of a project and especially in the two books that you've mentioned, my third and fourth,
*  I have found it difficult to know where to begin with the writing process. With this one,
*  as soon as I sort of conceived of Peter, the older brother character, as soon as he kind of
*  walked into my brain, I wrote down what is now the first page of the novel almost instantly and
*  it's hardly changed. It was like this kind of, and as you call it, a stream of consciousness.
*  It was like a very fragmented, fluid way of trying to grapple with his interiority.
*  And it just started like that and basically kind of went on like that. So there was never a point
*  where I consciously thought to myself, I'd love to have a go at writing sentences like that or
*  trying to construct a scene like that. It was always just how do I get closer or how do I get
*  the reader to understand what I'm seeing in my head? And I'll do anything to get to the idea.
*  And so whatever language I have to use to get to the idea, I'll use it.
*  Do you feel like you're just trying to get to the idea when you're writing sex scenes?
*  Yeah, I'm trying to get to the idea. I mean, I'm certainly trying to convey the idea. Yeah,
*  because I think what's really important for me all the way through all my work is human dynamics,
*  interpersonal dynamics. And so often the crucial changes in the dynamic between two people,
*  or more, but usually in my work too, can happen in the context of sexual interaction.
*  So when there are sort of crucial shifts in how two people relate to each other,
*  I think in my work, well, those shifts have to happen on the page. I can't just catch up later
*  and say, oh, something really important happened between them, but I didn't want to write about
*  that. So you just have to take my word for it. That's not always an easy thing to do. It can be
*  a challenge. Stylistically, it can be a challenge in terms of just what I would call petty personal
*  reasons. It's embarrassing. But I feel like to be true to my work, I have to go there because if
*  I'm committed to writing about how two people can come to mean something to one another, to be a
*  huge part of each other's lives, sometimes I have to go into the most intimate moments that they
*  share. I have to say, also, I feel hyper self-conscious about raising the topic of
*  sex writing with you because I really don't want to come off as remotely skeevy or anything like
*  that. But your writing about sex is so not corny. Are there writers who you feel like you learned
*  from? Do you have friends that you show that writing to and you're like, let me know if this
*  sounds corny? Like, how do you? See, now you've set me up for failure here because if I start
*  talking about how I avoid cringe, you know, a lot of people think I don't. So of course,
*  I'm going to confidently say, well, here's how. My intention was not to trick you.
*  Here's how I avoid ever doing anything embarrassing in my work. And it's absolutely fair for people to
*  have the exact response that you've described not having to my work and to say, oh my God,
*  I'm cringing so much that I can't read the scene. I can't finish the scene because it's so full of
*  words that I find just horrible on the page. I think that for me, it feels like a little bit
*  of a tightrope act. I think all prose writing does actually, but particularly, I think those
*  very intimate scenes. One of the challenges that this presents is that my vocabulary becomes very
*  repetitive and narrow in those sections. And that becomes an editorial conversation because
*  I think part of it is I want to convey a sense of repetition in a way. I want to create an enclosed
*  sense of intimacy and sometimes repeating vocabulary can help to create that sense of
*  enclosure and closeness. But also I know that that can, with too much of it, become just unpleasant
*  to read and feel just clunky and wrong. So it's again, a little bit of a tightrope thing.
*  And there's such a large degree of subjectivity there, both aesthetically and I think erotically,
*  if you want to put it that way. So I just do the best that I can, which is such a,
*  which is such an unimpressive answer. I'm sorry.
*  And you're what are you 33, something like that?
*  Yeah, 33.
*  Do you have done exceedingly well for yourself? You know, you have an audience, a lot of the,
*  I know you try not to pay attention to the discourse around, but a lot of it is like
*  framed as, you know, the people said like first grade millennial novelist or there's
*  cornier phrases and that's a salinger for the Snapchat generation is one that comes to mind.
*  I'm just curious if you think about your youth in relation to your work and what it means.
*  It's so difficult to think about one's own youth for lack of comparison,
*  because I've never been older than I am now. I'm obviously not as young as I was when I started
*  publishing. So I kind of feel like I'm exiting the period of certainly extreme sort of noticeable
*  youth and entering more what I would call normal age. I'm sure that in 10 years, 20 years,
*  I will feel differently about how my youth or my age will say inflected my
*  writing, my position in the culture and indeed even how my work is talked about
*  than I do now, because it's so hard to have a sense of those things.
*  So I think certainly part of this, and it's interesting how I keep bringing the questions
*  back to the public reception of my work, which I started out by saying I know nothing about and
*  don't have any interest in, which it seems like that was a lie because I keep talking about it.
*  Paging Dr. Freud.
*  Yeah, but it's because I'm talking to you. So it's like now I'm being placed back into a position
*  that has started to feel unfamiliar, that I almost feel I don't belong in, that I have a
*  complicated relationship with. And of course, that's like dredging up all these feelings about
*  my public role. And that's what I keep incessantly talking about while saying,
*  and I don't care about that. I never think about that, by the way. So that's probably more revealing
*  than I would like. But of course, I do think that my youth has been an element in the reception of
*  my work. And I'm also aware, of course, that my youth is very much at play in the work that I've
*  written because I'm very much aware that I belong to a generation that came of age around the
*  financial crisis. And I am aware of how that cultural experience, that generational experience
*  is there in my work. Like I think my character's relationship with housing, for instance,
*  it's been there from the first book. It's not that I sat down and said to myself, I'm going
*  to be a novelist who writes about my generation's relationship to housing or to the housing crisis
*  that was never consciously on my mind. But of course, it was simply in the air. So I am aware
*  of how generational my work is. But I find myself a little bit hesitant to speak about it because
*  it can be a difficult topic. In what way? It can be a little tricky to be a young woman in the public
*  eye. And I say that having been a much younger woman in the public eye, like I did it when I was,
*  I think, 26 maybe when my first book came out. And that's young, in my opinion. I think that
*  there's a huge level of visibility that is accorded to young women specifically. And that's
*  something that I grapple with, the unfairness of that and my having benefited from the unfairness
*  of that, but also the other side of it, which is the difficulty of hyper visibility. It has been
*  difficult for me on a personal level to manage that level of visibility, which isn't something
*  that I would have always wished to have. Yeah. No, I think it seems perfectly valid and legible
*  to suggest as I think you are. There's obviously beneficial things to being famous and successful
*  and things about it that are awful. You don't need to couch that at any.
*  But I didn't say that. You said that, just to be clear.
*  What do you like to do when you're not writing?
*  What do I like to do? I mean, I read, obviously. I feel like I'm so uninteresting. This is the
*  problem that I have when I do interviews is that I feel like beyond talking about my book,
*  which I can talk about with some authority. Do you think I'm expecting you to say you
*  hellaski? But even that coming from me would be like, why is that interesting that she does it?
*  But you said you're on a human level. I'm not interesting in any way. I'm just like a random
*  person and I do all the things you would expect a writer would do. Read, watch films, watch TV.
*  I feel almost like there's something in me that resists being humanized. At least when I talk
*  about my work, I feel I'm holding on to something. It's like I've got hold of something and it's like,
*  well, I'm the one who can talk about it because I wrote it. So I feel like I can stand or rather
*  sit here. It's justified in a way. I need this constant self-justification to feel that I can
*  sit here and talk to you at all. Otherwise I'd be running away because it's nerve wracking.
*  The only justification I can find is that I've written work that's in the public and you're
*  entitled to grill me about it and I should have to come up with answers. That feels real.
*  Somehow I get a little bit of shifting sands when I start trying to talk about things that
*  stray from that. I think that's what it is. Yeah. In all your books, the characters, even though
*  the central thrust of the books tends to be relationships between people, the people who
*  are having the relationships are thinking about the biggest questions. Like how do we live under
*  capitalism? What kind of person do I want to be? When it comes to the biggest questions,
*  do you in any way feel that exploring those questions through your work helps you get
*  closer to answers that you find personally satisfying?
*  That's interesting. I had never thought about that, oddly. I think that I'm so
*  committed to being with my characters that I sense myself as an almost passive observer
*  following their conversations with one another and their interior monologues,
*  their streams of consciousness. I don't sense my own participation in that. I'm walking the tight
*  rope of trying to write it down in prose that I don't hate. That's kind of my job.
*  But of course, there must be some reason why they find themselves drawn to the same kind of
*  questions that I find myself drawn to philosophically, ideologically, interpersonally.
*  So what's the interplay there? I definitely think there must be some. I think that I find my work
*  very personally fulfilling. When I am writing a project, I am at my happiest. When the writing is
*  going well, I feel like I have my dream life and I'm so happy. I feel very enriched by what I do.
*  So there must be some level on which it's not just the satisfaction of a good day's
*  hard work done. There's something maybe else going on like what you're talking about, that I'm
*  gaining some insight through the sort of wacky mirror of my characters who don't seem to resemble
*  me at all or through their philosophical wrangling, I myself am getting closer to answers to questions
*  that I am asking myself. So there's definitely a deep relationship between the work that I do
*  and the relationship between my work and my sense of being in the world. I suspect that for me,
*  there probably is something there that I'm learning from my characters in some way or that
*  by making them confront these problems and these difficult questions, I'm almost confronting them
*  in a camera obscura sort of way or I'm allowing myself to experience other lives, lives that I
*  haven't had. And I think one of the things that I find haunting or that I find difficult to accept
*  that I think maybe a lot of other people do is that I only get one life. I'm condemned to just
*  being myself and I have to be me until the end and I find that so weird to get my head around.
*  That's the it, I'm just me and I can never be anyone else. And in a way, being a novelist
*  allows me to get around that problem. Yeah, you know, my own response to what you were just saying,
*  that you find it haunting that you, you know, only get to be you. I feel so much of the opposite
*  that when I'm just thinking about it now, it actually brings tears to my eyes because it makes
*  me emotional to think and to feel like I get to be me and there's all this, like I get to have the
*  kids that I have and have the family and I have and have the friends I have and have the life I
*  have. And I just feel like so like the just the sheer gratitude about getting to be who I am
*  existing, given the sheer unlikelihood of that. It's like, how could you possibly be haunted by
*  that feeling? Yeah, but I think that what you're talking about and what I'm talking about might be
*  closer than you think because what you're describing, I also feel and especially when I'm
*  in the middle of a project and I close my laptop, it's the end of the day and I return to my own
*  life, I definitely feel that sense of indescribable gratitude that I'm alive on this earth,
*  that I know the people who I know, that, you know, my loved ones are part of my life
*  and that I can like look around at trees and that I can experience the sensory reality of the earth.
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. And that's something that I think my work actually
*  puts me in touch with because I it's like I go into what feels like another life, another world,
*  another mind, another set of problems. Everybody has them. And then when I close my laptop,
*  I'm returned to my own life, my own problems, if you will, and my own circumstances. And I
*  remember what an incredible, almost unbelievable gift it is just to exist.
*  After the break, I call Sally back to talk about the TV adaptations of her first two books
*  and why she's not planning on doing another one anytime soon.
*  You know, I was seeing, for instance, the extent to which the young cast members became,
*  you know, were really thrust into an extremely harsh spotlight and had paparazzi following them
*  around. And I felt kind of uncomfortable with the level of frenzy.
*  Hi, Sally.
*  Hello. Hi.
*  You know, there was one subject you raised earlier where, you know, I realized I was
*  nodding along when you were talking about it, but only really understood what you meant in a very
*  general fashion. You had said, you know, it can be difficult to be a young woman in the public eye.
*  Can you tell me a little bit more specifically about that experience that felt difficult?
*  Yeah, and it's difficult for me to talk about specifically because I feel very inhibited by a
*  lot of different pressures. And one of those pressures is that I'm extremely conscious of
*  my extraordinary good fortune in so many ways. So like the fact that my books have been so widely
*  read and discussed, that's an enormous privilege. Lots of writers don't get it. And perhaps that
*  has to do in some sense with the fact of my youth or even of being a young woman. So I find that
*  like a tough question to answer. It's like I want to be able to gesture to it very vaguely and for
*  everybody to go, oh, of course, we know what you're talking about, without me having to say,
*  and then this happened and then this happened, you know, and that was so hard for me personally.
*  I suppose, again, to occupy the more abstract general position, I think that the role
*  afforded to young women in the culture at large generally tends to be a very visible role and very
*  image focused and less intellectual. And of course, the young women who are given the most
*  prominent roles in our mainstream culture tend to be sort of not political figures and not public
*  intellectuals and not critics or commentators, more likely singers, actors, and people whose
*  image is a huge part of their presentation. And then so for me to feel like I'm trying to,
*  that's maybe the space that I'm trying to work within. And sometimes I feel that maybe I'm not
*  legible within that space. And so I sometimes feel people want to read me as something closer to
*  a kind of celebrity figure, because that's maybe the way in which we're used to reading the image
*  of a young woman in our culture. And it's, yeah, so but again, that's like, I recognize as well how
*  lucky I am to be in a position where anyone's listening to anything I say at all. But there is
*  that slight tension, I think, for me, in trying to assert or occupy a particular position in the
*  culture and feeling like maybe it's difficult to make room for myself there, if that makes sense.
*  It does make sense. It does make sense. I want to ask also about the adaptations of your work.
*  I think the general consensus was that the conversations with friends adaptation was not
*  quite as strong as the normal people adaptation. And you weren't quite as involved in that one.
*  Do you wish you'd been more involved?
*  No, I don't. I think that the reason that I chose not to be so involved in the second adaptation
*  was because I was working on what became my third novel. And I also felt that the experience of
*  working on the first one had been like in so many ways, amazing, the team of people involved in it,
*  but it did also feel like a lot, like a really big job. And then also, of course, when the show was
*  broadcast, that felt like a lot in terms of the amount of discourse that it generated and the
*  amount of media attention that followed on that. And I felt that that world was not where I belonged.
*  So I was very happy to allow that team to kind of make something new of the book without me needing
*  to be looking over their shoulder. And I think that's what they did. So yeah, I think for me,
*  I see myself so strongly as a novelist. And in a way, it was great to have the experience of working
*  on a television show. But it was also a kind of an interesting lesson for me in that I felt like,
*  okay, now I know that my books are where I belong. And that's all that I want to be doing.
*  And does it feel at all difficult to, in a sense, give control up of your stories to other creators?
*  No, it kind of felt like my book is still just its own thing. So that felt okay to me. But also,
*  as I said, the level of attention and public discourse that's attendant on the world of film
*  and television felt quite alien to me. And it felt like the, you know, I was seeing, for instance,
*  the extent to which the young cast members became, you know, were really thrust into an extremely
*  harsh spotlight and had paparazzi following them around. And that felt like, oh my God,
*  my intervention in the culture has resulted in something that I'm really uncomfortable with,
*  like a kind of real invasion of the lives of like young people who are absolutely hugely
*  talented and gifted professionals, but also just human beings. And it felt like I felt kind of
*  uncomfortable with the level of frenzy around the, yeah.
*  It's like a Frankenstein's monster situation.
*  Right, with the attention, not obviously with the people. But yeah, of course, I did kind of feel,
*  I felt uncomfortable with that. And although I wasn't on the receiving end of that level of
*  crazed attention, I certainly felt like I was getting a little fraction of it. And even that
*  was like way too much for me. Yeah. Is anybody working on adapting
*  Beautiful World? Where are you? No, so I decided not to accept any,
*  so far I have decided not to accept any offers to option the rights for that book.
*  For reasons related to what you were just saying, or why is that?
*  For exactly the reasons that we've just been talking about. And I think, yeah, I think it's,
*  I felt like it was just time to take a break from that and let the book kind of be its own thing for
*  a while. I have one last question. Maybe it's too big of a question to end on, but I
*  think it relates to a recurring theme in your work. You know, how one might live a meaningful life
*  in a time of historical crisis. How do we make our time here mean something? You know, how do we give
*  it value? How do you think about the value of your work in that regard? I mean, I think that's a
*  really good question and a really difficult question, and certainly one that I constantly
*  return to in my own life and also I think in my work directly and indirectly. I feel absolutely
*  convinced that our present, you know, world system is not fit for purpose. I think the rate at which
*  we're destroying our planetary ecosystems is obviously completely unsustainable. And I mean,
*  we have physicists telling us this. We kind of know that there is no way that we can continue
*  living the lifestyles we live under the economic systems that we have designed and that we continue
*  to propagate. That's a kind of crisis that is extremely pressing. And of course, I'm aware that
*  I've spent three years of my life working on a novel that does not really directly contribute
*  anything to the struggle against these forces. And of course, I do absolutely question why I've
*  done that. Partly, I think, because I didn't know what else to do. Also, I suppose I tell myself that
*  in the midst of all of this, people need to feel that life has meaning, like not to become so
*  incredibly overwhelmed by the enormity of the problems that we're facing as to feel that life
*  itself is no longer meaningful and that in fact, there's no reason to go on. And I don't think
*  that that actually is a very uncommon feeling. And I suppose part of what I feel is that art has a
*  role in giving people a reason to go on and that that is an important thing in and of itself.
*  It's consolation for people who are involved in the struggle in some way. But that's a very
*  self-justifying answer because I don't know if that's true. Yeah, I don't know is the answer
*  to the question. But I suppose that I do feel that the work of art has an autonomy from the
*  world of political urgency. It's not that I think that art is in any way sealed off from
*  ideological concerns, but that it can't be expected to solve political crises and that it has to be
*  allowed to exist anyway. Kind of even if it's not good, because I feel like a lot of this would be
*  more easy to justify if I could say, you know, and thankfully, all my novels are works of genius.
*  But what I will say is they're completely sincere. If they're bad, then they're sincerely bad. Like
*  I genuinely put my heart and soul into them. And that's the best I could do. And I had to write
*  them. I felt like I didn't have any choice. But and also it sounds like you get real pleasure
*  from doing the work. And I feel confident in saying that there are people who get pleasure
*  from reading the work. And that that's not nothing. Well, thank you. And it's not nothing.
*  Certainly not to me. It's kind of everything.
