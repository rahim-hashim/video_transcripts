# Why Russia Is Taking Thousands of Ukrainian Children
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOnv-fCNnzU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  As Vladimir Putin makes his case for the war in Ukraine to the Russian people, he's using
*  an unexpected tool, Ukrainian children.
*  Ukraine says thousands of them, mostly orphans, have been relocated to Russia, where they
*  are placed in Russian families and paraded on Russian television.
*  Today, my colleague Emma Bubula tells the story of one of those children.
*  It's Friday, March 3rd.
*  So Emma, usually when we talk about the war in Ukraine, we talk about battles and weapons
*  and military strategy.
*  But you've been reporting on a very different kind of campaign by Russia.
*  And this campaign involves children.
*  Tell me about this reporting.
*  Yeah, so I was covering the news about Ukraine last summer, and I started seeing these pretty
*  shocking allegations by Ukrainian authorities that Russia was taking Ukrainian children
*  without their parents to Russia, and sometimes placing them in Russian families and giving
*  them up for adoption.
*  And Emma, to be clear, the accusations were that Russian soldiers were taking Ukrainian
*  children back to Russia?
*  No, at that time, the accusations were really vague.
*  So it was Russia is taking Ukrainian children, but we did not know exactly where they were
*  taking them to, where they were taking them from, how they were being taken, and who was
*  taking them.
*  And that's what I wanted to figure out, to identify at least some cases to report if
*  this was happening and how.
*  And when you started looking into it, what were you seeing?
*  So, Sabrina, it looked like there was a pattern of systematic removal of Ukrainian children,
*  many from group homes that are very common in Ukraine, orphanages or institutions that
*  care for children who are not necessarily orphans.
*  And they were relocating them to Russia with the plan to give them Russian citizenship
*  and placing them in Russian families.
*  And Ukrainian authorities say that while the majority of these children who have been
*  forcibly taken to Russia were orphans, there were many who were also taken from their parents,
*  separated from their parents at filtration points, or who have relatives or family who
*  would be ready to take them back in Ukraine.
*  So essentially, not all of these children were necessarily abandoned.
*  In some cases, Ukraine is actually saying Russia separated them from their parents.
*  Yes, they're saying that in some cases, their parents were imprisoned and the children were
*  taken to Russia.
*  Wow.
*  What's the scale?
*  How many children are we talking about?
*  Yeah, so from the beginning, it seemed like a pretty serious problem because both Russia
*  Ukraine kind of did not deny that it was at least a thousand children, probably many more.
*  But Ukraine says that Russia has taken 16,000 children.
*  Oh, wow.
*  That's a lot of children.
*  Yeah, this is just the number that Ukraine has been able to verify.
*  They know exactly the name of these children, where they were from, where they are.
*  They say these children are mostly orphans.
*  So Russia says it's at least a thousand.
*  Ukraine says it's more like 16,000.
*  So at the very least, we can say this is thousands of children.
*  Yeah, but I wanted to understand what was the actual experience of one of these children
*  because Russians, they agreed that this was happening and on a big scale, but they were
*  portraying what was happening in very different ways.
*  But to Ukraine, these were stolen, kidnapped children, and to Russia, these were rescued
*  children.
*  So I wanted to speak to one child and to understand what was their actual experience of this.
*  Interesting, because both sides essentially kind of did not disagree that this was a big
*  thing that was going on, but they totally disagreed about what it was that was going on.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So I started reaching out to children who had some experience with this transfer to
*  Russian controlled areas.
*  And as I interviewed them, many of them seemed to point me in the direction of one girl who
*  was still in Russia, Anya.
*  And with my colleague, Alina Lobzina from the Moscow Bureau, we managed to find Anya
*  on social media.
*  And slowly over weeks, she told us her story.
*  Tell me about Anya.
*  So Anya is a 14, now 15 year old girl.
*  And to reconstruct Anya's story, we spoke to her over months, but we also spoke to her
*  friends and we had access to some court documents.
*  And so her story is the story of a child from Eastern Ukraine, who some months before the
*  war started was actually flagged to Ukraine Social Services as living in a family in which
*  parents avoided fulfilling parental responsibilities.
*  And what does that mean?
*  According to court documents, they describe her house as being unfit to welcome children.
*  Her mother was disabled and she was out of work.
*  So they moved her to the sanatorium.
*  This is something that is very common in Ukraine.
*  So before the war, more than 90,000 children were living in institutions.
*  This is a heritage from the Soviet era in which there was a kind of idea that the state
*  can care for the children of families who cannot afford to care for them or if the child
*  is disabled or has other issues, the state can care for them better than their family.
*  So Anya was among those 90,000 Ukrainian children who were wards of the state or were
*  living in institutions for some other reason.
*  Yeah, so Anya was living in a group home in the city of Mariupol.
*  And so children who were with her in this group home described her as a shy girl with
*  a passion for drawing and for reading fairy tales, either by herself or to a younger child
*  that she was kind of being like an older sister for.
*  And she was like really caring with her and affectionate.
*  So what happens to Anya when the war breaks out?
*  I mean, we know that Mariupol was just pummeled by Russian forces.
*  Yeah, so some children managed to reconnect with their parents and leave this group home
*  in Mariupol.
*  And Anya, who had sporadic contact with her mother, does not manage to make contact with
*  her or get picked up by her.
*  So together with about 16 other children, she hides in the basement of this group home.
*  And that actually turns out to be a smart idea because shells fall near some of the
*  buildings of this group home.
*  And after some days of hiding, one volunteer from Mariupol finds the children in this group
*  home and decides to evacuate them, to bring them away because it was extremely dangerous
*  at the time.
*  And so he puts them on an ambulance and wants to take them to Zaporizhzhia.
*  It's another city in Ukraine that was considered safer then.
*  And as they head out of the city, they get stopped at a checkpoint because Mariupol was
*  already under Russian siege.
*  And they're not let through.
*  So as the children wait for a decision to be made about what's going to happen to them,
*  everyone whom I spoke to who was there described the group of pro-Russian officials storming
*  in and kind of deciding that these children are going to go into Russian controlled territory
*  instead of going to a safer part of Ukraine.
*  And Anya and the other children were put on a bus, headed deeper into Russian controlled
*  territory.
*  So these kids were in a vehicle headed toward Ukrainian territory, were actually taken out
*  of that vehicle and put on a bus headed to Russian territory.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  From there, Anya is taken to Russia.
*  So Anya told us that no one really asked her if she wanted to go to Russia.
*  And she called a friend and she cried because she didn't want to be there.
*  So first she spent some time in some camps or rehabilitation facilities, as they call
*  them.
*  And then she gets moved into a foster family.
*  And what was that foster home like?
*  Yes, in her foster home, there are six more children, four dogs.
*  Anya shares a room with two boys, which she says is fun and not scary because she says
*  she's often scared to be alone.
*  She calls her foster parents aunt and uncle.
*  She said they treat her nicely.
*  They do crafts together.
*  They go to parks, walk the dogs in the evening.
*  But when we spoke to her last fall, she still very much wanted to go back to her home and
*  be reunited with her family.
*  So on the one hand, Anya has been forced to go to Russia, a place she didn't want to go
*  in the first place.
*  But on the other hand, it's a less dire and desperate picture than I was imagining.
*  I mean, she likes her foster family.
*  Yeah, I mean, they're not bringing children to like prison camps.
*  You know, they are very much placing them into families.
*  And many times these families are very well meaning.
*  You know, they have a mix of patriotism and love for these children.
*  And does she go to school?
*  Yes. At the same time, she told us that she went to school and that she had these classes
*  that are basically patriotism classes called conversations about important things that
*  were recently introduced in Russia.
*  And they, you know, they're given in these classes, they teach topics like the
*  geopolitical situation or like traditional values.
*  It's basically to teach children how to be proud of Russia.
*  The geopolitical situation as in the war in Ukraine?
*  Yeah, they do talk about the war and they are given virtual tours of Crimea, for example.
*  And what do they tell her about the war in Ukraine?
*  So we don't know this from Anya because it was really hard to get information from her
*  about these classes. But what we do know is that when she was at one of these centers
*  where she was staying in Russia before she went into the family, she told us the teacher
*  is knew more than I do about Ukraine.
*  They tell me that Ukraine is really bad, that she said, I don't believe it.
*  For me, Ukraine will always be good.
*  So they're really trying to teach her that her own country is a bad place and she should
*  be glad she's in Russia.
*  Yeah, for sure. I think the purpose is to integrate her completely into Russian society.
*  And I mean, the maybe strongest evidence of that is the fact that she was given Russian
*  citizenship.
*  So she has a Russian passport now.
*  So she was given Russian citizenship.
*  Is that unusual?
*  Yeah, there is like a clear intention by Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, to
*  give citizenship to orphans from Ukraine.
*  And he did a decree to streamline this procedure in May.
*  And so, you know, this is just another indication of how systematic Russia wants this
*  Russification of Ukrainian children to be.
*  So it's not just Anya, it's all of these other children and it's directed by Putin
*  himself. But why is Russia doing this?
*  Like, what's in it for them?
*  I think a lot of the answer to this question might be in the way that Russia is not
*  hiding the transfer of, you know, at least like more than a thousand children from
*  Ukraine. That kind of shows that Russia is using these children as part of a propaganda
*  campaign to portray Russia as saviors of Ukrainian children and of Ukraine.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Emma, before the break, you were telling me that there had been thousands of
*  Ukrainian children taken to Russian territory and that this act by Russia was largely
*  for propaganda purposes.
*  You said that they were trying to frame their war as a humanitarian mission.
*  Who exactly is Russia talking to here and what is it trying to sell?
*  So this relocation of Ukrainian children fits really nicely into a propaganda targeted
*  domestic audience in Russia because this war is premised on the idea that Ukraine
*  doesn't really exist and that Ukraine is just a part of Russia, that Ukrainian
*  identity isn't real, and that all Russia is doing is correcting a historical
*  mistake by making Ukraine a part of Russia again.
*  So the message is that these children are Russian and going back to where they
*  belong.
*  So this is something that Putin has been arguing all along, right?
*  That, you know, essentially there is no Ukraine, that it's just Russia and that it
*  has these strange habits, but it really is Russia and belongs to Russia.
*  Yeah, I spoke to a mother who told me that she took into her family four children
*  from Ukraine and she told me, we're not taking anything that is not ours.
*  And, you know, she even likened what her family did to what Russia is doing because
*  Russia annexed four territories and our family took in four children.
*  So it's, there is really like a parallel between this like broader idea of a war
*  in which, you know, Russia is rescuing Ukraine and these families rescuing these
*  children.
*  And I think that these children are actually a very effective way of doing
*  this because, you know, often they were not torn from perfect families.
*  Many of them were orphans or living in state-run facilities before the war.
*  So, you know, they have even like a stronger case arguing that Russia is
*  giving a family and a loving family to children who would otherwise have none.
*  So then Russia really is using these kids to make an argument to the Russian people
*  about why their war is just and right.
*  What forms does that take?
*  Like, what are they saying exactly and where are they saying it?
*  Yeah, so there is an abundance of videos and articles and state media that, you
*  know, show how the children are arriving to Russia and placed in Russian families.
*  So often these children arrive by train or by airplane and are received by TV
*  cameras.
*  They're given teddy bears.
*  Now interviewed saying how happy they are to be in a Russian family.
*  And, you know, they even did a series of documentaries that was widely circulated.
*  Especially in Russian controlled areas of Ukraine, documentaries about the kids.
*  Yeah, it's a series of videos about like several kids were taken into Russian
*  families.
*  You know, they describe kind of like their daily life and how, again, happy they
*  are to be in a Russian family.
*  And in this video, there is like a lot of emphasis on the trauma that these children
*  have been through.
*  And for example, like there is in one of these videos, some foster parents or
*  adoptive parents taking care of their kids.
*  Foster parents or adoptive parents take these children from Ukraine to.
*  It looks like a war simulation, like a playful war simulation, but the children get
*  really scared and like.
*  The video shows the children crying and it projects like black and white images of
*  like war and destruction.
*  To advocate maybe what these children might be thinking about and, you know, the
*  Russian parent promptly comforts them.
*  So, you know, it kind of feels like they want to emphasize the fact that Russian
*  families are finally providing a safe, comfortable environment to these children.
*  I think that, you know, Russia kind of like forgets to say that while helping these
*  children, like few months before, like in the case of Anya, it was bombing the homes
*  where they were staying.
*  I mean, it's just very deeply cynical use of these children.
*  One of the, I think, most like egregious examples is this Russian official who has
*  coordinated this relocation effort by Russia.
*  And she herself adopted a child from Mariupol and she talks about him a lot on state
*  media and she detailed how this child in the beginning was, you know, talking about
*  the fact that he went to pro-Ukraine protests and how like in the beginning he was like
*  sitting alone, like missing his home, he grew up his friends from Mariupol, but then how
*  like with time he came to appreciate his new home in Russia.
*  And in July, when the first batch of Ukrainian children obtained Russian citizenship in the
*  Moscow region, you know, and officials posed in these photo ops with the Russian official,
*  in official statement, she said, you know, I didn't recognize these kids from when we
*  traveled in April on the train.
*  Now they're our little fellow citizens.
*  It just seems like fundamentally it's bringing the whole mythology and thrust of the war
*  and why Putin started it full circle, right?
*  Ukraine isn't a place that exists at all.
*  Ukrainians don't exist.
*  They're actually Russians.
*  And look what we have here.
*  We have a bunch of little Russians.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I think it's quite interesting how she herself kind of illustrates what Russia wants to do
*  with these children, which is, you know, basically they cut them off from their original nation
*  and just turn them into Russian citizens.
*  And actually that's something that Ukrainian officials consider as a way in which Russia
*  can make it even harder for them to claim them back because, you know, they're saying,
*  oh, they're Russian now.
*  Like, why are you asking for them?
*  Why are you trying to get them back?
*  So given that many of these children didn't have guardians when they were taken to Russia,
*  it probably complicates the effort to have them return to Ukraine, right?
*  So I guess, you know, I'm wondering what are the Ukrainians doing to get these kids back?
*  It really depends.
*  Ukrainian authorities are urging parents, guardians, family members to show up and to
*  make appeals because to start this process to return children, like it usually starts
*  from an appeal from like a family member or like someone who's looking for this child.
*  So, you know, children who don't have anyone, of course, it's much harder to return them
*  because no one is actively looking for them.
*  And how many kids are in that category?
*  I mean, who have a parent or a guardian step forward and claim them?
*  I don't know in total how many, you know, have parents looking for them or guardians,
*  but like what we know is that 300 children have already been returned out of a total
*  of 16,000 that Ukrainian authorities have identified.
*  So this number is very small.
*  So Emma, stepping back here, I mean, these were children, for the most part,
*  like Anya, who were taken from group homes and orphanages and placed in families in Russia.
*  And, you know, yes, they're being fed this Russian propaganda about
*  their own native-born country and about Russia.
*  But it seems like, you know, just to play devil's advocate here for a second,
*  they're in potentially better and safer environments than they were before.
*  Even if it's not necessarily what they themselves would have chosen.
*  Yeah.
*  What do you make of that?
*  Yeah, I think it's very complicated.
*  And, you know, we did speak to a child who was happy to be in Russia.
*  But I think, yeah, I think it's really not for me or for Russia to decide what's better
*  for Ukrainian children.
*  You know, the fact that these, some of these children might be placed in nice families
*  is not a justification to remove masses of children from a national group to another
*  and have them change nationality, you know, erase their heritage, grow up in countries,
*  in some cases as bombed homes in which they were living.
*  So, and adding to that, I think that we actually don't know much about the family situation
*  or potential like family ties of these children.
*  You know, and we actually have, you know, the chief of the UN refugee agency said that,
*  you know, in a situation of war, you cannot really know if a child has a family.
*  And until, you know, that is verified, you cannot give them another nationality
*  or have them adopted in other family because, you know, it goes against the fundamental
*  principles of child protections in situations of war.
*  Emma, is this a war crime?
*  Well, yeah, the United States recently said that, you know, this unlawful like transfer of
*  children is a breach of the Geneva Convention and constitutes a war crime.
*  And in general, more widely, the international community has really condemned this practice.
*  And this Russian official who has been coordinating, organizing this transfer
*  was put on the sanctions list of several Western countries.
*  But, you know, prosecuting war crimes is really hard, takes a lot of time.
*  And in the meantime, you know, these children might grow up.
*  And for now, you know, Stephen Raab, the former US ambassador at large for war crimes, told me that
*  for now, there is not much that Ukraine can do to legally compel Russia to return these children.
*  And what about Anya? What's happened to her? Does her mother know where she is?
*  Yeah, so Anya's situation is very different and very difficult.
*  So I was able to connect with her mother last fall, and she had no idea that Anya was in Russia.
*  And even after I told her, she still like couldn't really believe it.
*  Also, you know, Anya's mom is out of work. She doesn't really have like
*  internet at home. And, you know, for her just like fathoming a trip to Russia to get her back
*  would be like going to the moon. But despite this, you know, in the meantime, Anya's mom was also
*  officially deprived of parental right, meaning that the government has, you know, taken away her
*  custody. So I mean, I think, you know, she doesn't have even much of a claim at this point. So yeah,
*  it looks like the odds of her returning are not very high right now.
*  Emma, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today. In an unexpected meeting on Thursday at the Group of 20
*  Conference in New Delhi, Secretary of State Antony Blinken confronted his Russian counterpart,
*  Sergey Lavrov, and demanded that Russia end its war against Ukraine. It was the first private
*  face to face exchange between a U.S. cabinet member and a top Russian official since the invasion last
*  year. The meeting happened at Blinken's request, suggesting that the Biden administration wants to
*  keep lines of communication open with Russia. It came as the White House prepares to announce
*  another round of military aid for Ukraine when President Biden meets with German Chancellor
*  Olaf Scholz on Friday. And...
*  Alex Murdoch, the fourth generation lawyer whose family long exerted influence in small
*  town South Carolina courtrooms, was convicted on Thursday of murdering his wife and his son.
*  The verdict sealed the dramatic downfall of a man who had substantial wealth and powerful
*  connections, but who lived a secret life in which he stole millions of dollars from clients and
*  colleagues and lied to many of those closest to him. The guilty verdict in Walterboro, South
*  Carolina followed a closely watched trial that lasted nearly six weeks and came more than 20
*  months after the June 2021 fatal shootings of Murdoch's wife, Maggie, and their younger son,
*  Paul. Today's episode was produced by Michael Simon Johnson with help from Muzhzadeh. It was
