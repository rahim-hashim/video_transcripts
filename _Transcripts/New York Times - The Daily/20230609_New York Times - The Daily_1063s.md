# Special Episode: A Second Trump Indictment
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uhw0VhOqHE)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  In a momentous legal and political decision, the Justice Department has decided to bring
*  federal criminal charges against Donald Trump over his handling of classified materials.
*  I spoke with my colleague, Mike Schmidt, about what that will mean for Trump and for President
*  Biden, whose administration will now be prosecuting his biggest potential rival for the White
*  House.
*  It's Friday, June 9th.
*  Mike, good evening.
*  I just want to set the scene for people.
*  It is 9.25 p.m.
*  We are calling you in your car in suburban Virginia, which means you weren't prepared
*  for this.
*  We weren't prepared for this.
*  It was a surprise.
*  So thank you for making time for us.
*  For the second time in just two months, former President Trump has been indicted.
*  These are astonishing times.
*  So just to start, Mike, what do we know at this point on Thursday night about what has
*  just happened?
*  About an hour and a half ago, Donald Trump took to his social media platform and announced
*  that he had been indicted in connection with an investigation of his handling of classified
*  documents.
*  He broke the story himself.
*  He volunteered it.
*  Trump just put it out there.
*  Trump has been under investigation by a special counsel for many months.
*  Investigators have been looking at documents he took from the White House at the end of
*  the administration and held on to and refused to give back to the government.
*  In the minutes after Trump put this out there, our reporters scrambled to try and figure
*  out what's known about this indictment.
*  And they learned that there are seven charges.
*  Okay.
*  And what do we know about these charges?
*  We know that at least one of the charges is a conspiracy to obstruct justice.
*  Another is providing the government with false statements.
*  One is a violation of the Espionage Act, which almost always relates to the retention of
*  classified documents.
*  So we can see a picture emerging that the government's indictment is going to focus
*  on how Trump wanted to hold on to these documents that were not his.
*  They were the government's, even after the government asked for them back and ultimately
*  subpoenaed them.
*  Right.
*  Well, let's just reestablish the basic facts here.
*  This is a case that has received a tremendous amount of attention.
*  And I think by now the basic facts are relatively well known.
*  But just to recap them, Trump leaves office and takes with him hundreds of classified
*  documents which the National Archive discovers are missing and asks for the return of.
*  That doesn't happen.
*  Instead, Trump tries to keep them, which prompts the FBI to search Mar-a-Lago and get many
*  of them back.
*  And these charges you're outlining, they seem mostly focused on the alleged crime of
*  a cover up rather than the original taking of documents.
*  Do I have that right?
*  Yeah.
*  Had Donald Trump just given all of this back when the government nicely asked for it in
*  the months after he left office, there would almost certainly be no problem here.
*  But the issue is that the government asked nicely and then it asked in a more stern way
*  through a subpoena.
*  Right.
*  And from the beginning of that process, even as it got more serious and serious, Trump
*  and his lawyers essentially did everything they could to hold on to these materials until
*  the Justice Department took this extraordinary step last August and executed a search warrant
*  at Mar-a-Lago to essentially get them back.
*  Right.
*  You're starting to hint at this, but what do we understand to be the most compelling
*  evidence gathered by the special counsel to justify these charges that Trump sought to
*  obstruct the government's effort to retrieve these documents?
*  So we will learn much more when we actually see the indictment when the Justice Department
*  unseals it.
*  But from what we know, the most glaring example is that as the Justice Department was trying
*  to get these back, Trump's lawyer said to the department under oath that he had handed
*  everything over and had no more classified documents.
*  But then when the FBI went in and did a search of Mar-a-Lago, they found dozens upon dozens
*  of classified documents showing as clear as day that what Trump's lawyer had told the
*  department was completely wrong.
*  So as the special counsel's office dug into this investigation and essentially talked
*  to everyone around Trump, ranging from his valets to his secret service agents to his
*  lawyers, they were able to learn about a range of other things that Trump had done
*  to essentially try and hide or hold on to the documents in the face of the government's
*  efforts.
*  Hmm.
*  Such as what?
*  They learned about how Trump had used an aid to go and get the documents and bring them
*  to him so he could go through them and figure out which ones he wanted to hand back to the
*  government and wanted to hold on to.
*  They were able to force his lawyers to testify, something that usually never happens before
*  a grand jury about what Trump was telling them.
*  Wow.
*  Investigators were also able to obtain an audio recording that had captured Trump just
*  months after he left office discussing a document about plans to essentially invade Iran.
*  And it was during that conversation on that audio recording that Trump said he was unable
*  to declassify the documents because he had already left office, essentially signaling
*  that he knew it was still classified.
*  Hmm.
*  I mean, there's a bunch of things about this alleged audio recording that seem very important.
*  The first is that it reveals that the nature of these documents is very sensitive.
*  War planning around Iran.
*  And secondly, it, as you said, suggests that he very well understands, in fact, says it
*  out loud in a recording that he understands the documents he has kept are classified.
*  On top of that, you don't need to be an FBI espionage investigator to know that the president
*  of the United States is given some of the most sensitive information that the government
*  has.
*  So, if this is stuff that Trump took from the White House, it was stuff that was given
*  to him when he was president and contains the national security secrets that underpin
*  all of America's military and intelligence operations around the world.
*  Right.
*  And as our colleagues have reported in the Times, these documents were being kept in
*  a pretty unsecured location at a resort with members who mingled very close by.
*  As a diagram that our colleagues did showed, there were parties at Mar-a-Lago just feet
*  from the closet where many of these documents are believed to have been held.
*  Other documents were found in the desk in his office, an office in which hundreds of
*  people have come parading through in the two and a half years since he left office.
*  So not only did he take these documents with him and then mislead the government about
*  it, but it's not like he was holding them in some special secret safe that no one could
*  break into.
*  They were kind of just mingling around Mar-a-Lago like anything else.
*  Mike, these are federal charges being brought by the Department of Justice and the Attorney
*  General Merrick Garland, who answers to President Biden, which now means the administration
*  of the sitting Democratic president who is seeking reelection will be trying to convict
*  his Republican front-runner opponent in the coming presidential race.
*  This is astonishing.
*  It's so, so extraordinary.
*  As we head into the 2024 election, Donald Trump will be defending himself in court against
*  Biden's Justice Department at the same time that he'll be trying to win the Republican
*  nomination so he can take on Biden.
*  I just don't know what to say.
*  We thought we had seen everything between the investigations into him when he was president
*  and the impeachment.
*  But even this has a layer of extraordinary-ness.
*  It's just Trump finds a way to outdo himself.
*  Mike, adding to the extraordinary nature of all this is the fact that President Biden
*  himself is under investigation by a different special counsel for the way he handled classified
*  documents that were found in his home.
*  It's not the same situation.
*  He gave them back right away.
*  There are no allegations that he sought to conceal them.
*  Regardless, this, we have to imagine, is going to fuel Trump's claim that the Biden Justice
*  Department is the wrong entity to bring this case against Trump and that they're out to
*  get him.
*  Look, Trump cited Biden's documents in his announcement of his own indictment.
*  Understanding classified documents and the ins and outs of the Presidential Records Act
*  and how classified documents should be handled is not something that the average person is
*  interested in or will understand.
*  But Republicans will seize on the idea that Biden has done the same thing as Trump to
*  try and undermine the validity of this investigation.
*  Right.
*  And I have to think that this will inevitably fit into Donald Trump's narrative now many
*  years in the making about the federal government being weaponized against him.
*  Of course.
*  Even when Trump was president of the United States and controlled the Justice Department
*  in the entire executive branch, he claimed that the deep state of the government was
*  out to get him.
*  Now he's being charged by the Biden Justice Department.
*  And there's never been anything like what's happened.
*  I'm an innocent man.
*  I'm an innocent person.
*  Not surprisingly, on the same platform where he announced his indictment, he put out a
*  video.
*  The whole thing is a hoax.
*  Just like Russia, Russia, Russia, just like the fake dossier was a hoax.
*  You saw the Durham report.
*  You saw the Mueller report.
*  It was all a big hoax.
*  You had two impeachments and they lost and we won.
*  Claiming that the government was out to get him.
*  I'm innocent and we will prove that very, very soundly and hopefully very quickly.
*  Thank you very much.
*  So Mike, what happens now?
*  Trump's announced he's been indicted.
*  We're waiting for the indictments to be unsealed.
*  What do the next few days look like?
*  In Trump's announcement, he said that on Tuesday afternoon he will be appearing in court in
*  Miami.
*  It's likely that what Trump's referring to is that he will be arraigned.
*  He essentially will be booked and brought before a judge who will determine whether
*  he can be released and under what terms.
*  And while that scene will be extraordinary, as we keep on saying, it'll be very similar
*  to the one that we saw just weeks ago when he was arraigned in court in New York on charges
*  filed there.
*  Right.
*  And like that arraignment in New York on 30 felony counts related to a hush money scheme
*  that Donald Trump was alleged to have been involved in, we already know will involve
*  a trial that starts in March of 2024 at the height of the Republican presidential primaries.
*  Do we know anything about when a federal trial related to classified documents might get
*  underway?
*  So given the complexities of this case and the fact that the federal system tends to
*  take a little bit longer than most, it's likely that Trump may not go on trial for another
*  two years or so until after the election.
*  So this is not something that will be resolved soon.
*  If Trump does go to trial and if he is convicted, what kind of sentence could he face with these
*  federal charges?
*  We will really need to see the indictment to get an exact figure about his exposure.
*  But we know that people that have been found guilty on similar charges have faced years,
*  if not decades, in prison.
*  The government takes classified documents and the retention of them very seriously.
*  On top of that, in this case, you have efforts to obstruct the government's attempts to
*  get those materials back.
*  So all of that taken together means that he could face a fair amount of time in prison
*  if found guilty.
*  He has never faced down something like he's facing down with this indictment.
*  But as we've seen, Donald Trump has an almost Houdini-like ability to get himself out of
*  trouble.
*  Well, Mike, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday night, congressional Republicans reacted to the latest Trump indictment with
*  fury, vowing to use their power to retaliate against the Biden administration for bringing
*  the charges.
*  In a tweet, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy wrote that Republicans, quote, will hold this brazen
*  weaponization of power accountable.
*  Democrats, meanwhile, called the charges both justified and overdue.
*  Congressman Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said that
*  the indictment revealed that Trump, quote, put our national security in grave.
