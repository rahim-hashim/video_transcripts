# A Guide to Election Night 2024
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMQHw29kCJ4)
*  Who did you vote for?
*  Kamala Harris.
*  100%.
*  I like it.
*  I voted Kamala.
*  I want to see Mr. Trump go way far away.
*  For Trump.
*  Donald Trump.
*  I had to vote for Trump.
*  I felt more connected to that.
*  Plus he was in my hood.
*  And either of them, Jill Stein.
*  For president, I left it blank.
*  I was indecisive and I wasn't really too keen on voting on who I was going to vote for.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Can I ask you to describe how you're feeling in one word?
*  Nervous.
*  Anxious.
*  Nervous.
*  I just feel it's a lot of chaos.
*  After two years of campaigning, more than a billion dollars of advertising, and a last-minute
*  change to one of the nominees, the 2024 race for president is now in the hands of the
*  American voters.
*  This is the most important election that I'm going to vote in in my adult life, I think.
*  You know, walking up here made me emotional because I look at my daughter and I know that
*  I'm voting for her future.
*  No matter who wins, one side or the other is going to feel like they've been cheated.
*  Everyone is going to be heartbroken on both sides.
*  I guess we just have to wait and see.
*  Today, as the ballot counting begins, my colleague Nate Cohn offers a guide for how to understand
*  tonight's results.
*  It's Tuesday, November 5th.
*  Nate.
*  Michael.
*  Thank you for coming in.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  Happy Election Day.
*  Happy Election Day.
*  Can you believe it?
*  I can't.
*  I can't really either.
*  So, Nate, we are here today to do something we started doing last election, which is offer
*  our listeners a roadmap to election night.
*  Because starting around 7 p.m. Eastern tonight, everyone's screens are going to be flooded
*  with vote tallies and breaking news banners about projected state victories.
*  And it's confusing.
*  And so we want to give people a user's guide to the entire night with you as our guide.
*  So guide away.
*  Guide us.
*  Well, let's just start by observing there are three basic scenarios for what could happen
*  and keep these in mind as we go through the chronology of the night.
*  Because at different points, we may know different things depending on what is really going on.
*  So our guide begins with scenarios.
*  And one thing I want to note about these three scenarios is that I think they're all very
*  plausible.
*  In fact, in each case, I think we could tell ourselves after the fact we should have seen
*  it coming all along.
*  One scenario is a decisive victory for Kamala Harris, a repudiation of Donald Trump.
*  After all, he led an insurrection on January 6th, the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs.
*  Wade.
*  Democrats have been overperforming in special elections and midterm elections.
*  And Kamala Harris has been gaining certainly over the longer stretch of this race back
*  to when Joe Biden was the Democratic nominee.
*  If in the end, the race broke her way, it would not be a great surprise.
*  And she could win a decisive victory, clearly in the popular vote and in the battleground
*  states.
*  A second scenario is the total flip side of that.
*  A decisive victory for Donald Trump, the culmination really of the populist realignment that he
*  unleashed in 2016.
*  In this scenario, the white working class voters who he won in 2016 stick by his side,
*  but now he adds to it the black working class and Hispanic working class and young voters.
*  That's a scenario where he wins the popular vote.
*  The first Republican to win the popular vote since 2004.
*  It's a Trump sweep of the seven battleground states in all likelihood.
*  I just want to point out that for either of these two first scenarios to be true, the
*  repudiation of Trump, big Harris victory, the Trump realignment, big Trump victory,
*  the polling that you have been intimately involved in for a year would have to have
*  been systematically off to a degree, either systematically underestimating her support
*  or systematically underestimating his support.
*  That's right.
*  And it's worth noting that it doesn't take too much of a systematic error either way
*  for this election to quickly look like a pretty decisive victory.
*  The polls are basically tied everywhere after all, right?
*  Move that three points to the left or three points to the right, things feel really differently,
*  really fast.
*  Right.
*  That said, if the polls are right and it is really close, then we have our third scenario,
*  which is yet another really close election.
*  All of these swing states are decided by one or two percentage points.
*  We have to stay up all night to count the votes.
*  Obviously there are a lot of different versions of this scenario.
*  One where Trump wins narrowly, one where Harris wins narrowly.
*  But either way, we have yet another election with Donald Trump on the ballot, yet another
*  close election.
*  Basically, this third scenario is a repeat of the grinding slog that was the 2020 presidential
*  race.
*  Yes.
*  This is hell and we don't have an outcome for quite some time.
*  You've got it.
*  Okay.
*  These are going to be useful touchstones, I suspect, as we turn to the question of how
*  all of this is going to unfold tonight, hour by hour.
*  So walk us through that as best you can.
*  Where do you want to start?
*  We start in the South.
*  That's where the polls will close first in North Carolina, Florida, Virginia and Georgia.
*  What time is it in our clock?
*  7 p.m. in Virginia and most of Florida and Georgia and 730 in North Carolina.
*  Polls close there.
*  And while you might think after the way the vote count went in 2020 that it could be a
*  week before we know anything there, in these states, we're going to know a lot fast.
*  We could even have race calls in all of these states, even in a fairly close election by
*  midnight.
*  Some of that's because the number of mail ballots have plummeted.
*  Some of it is because the states have improved their procedures.
*  In all of them, the early vote will tilt a little bit Democratic.
*  The early vote is usually counted first.
*  So Harris could come out to an early lead in North Carolina, for instance, Trump would
*  hope to counter on Election Day.
*  You're hinting at something that I think we all remember really well from 2020, which
*  is this concept of the mirages, which is to say that the minute the polls close and the
*  tallies begin to appear on our screens, they start to misrepresent a total outcome.
*  Based on Democratic early voting numbers, which tend to be high versus Election Day
*  voting numbers, which tend to tilt towards Republicans.
*  So you're saying we're going to immediately start to see either red or blue mirages of
*  some kind.
*  Yes.
*  That said, I do want to note that there will be a lot less mirage than four years ago.
*  The gap between the early vote and the Election Day vote is poised to be significantly reduced.
*  There are both fewer Democrats participating by mail and more Republicans decided to turn
*  out early in person.
*  And the combination of those two things has significantly reduced the Democratic advantage
*  in the early vote.
*  Got it.
*  And thus made the mirages a little less mirage.
*  Much less mirage.
*  Okay.
*  What should we be looking for in terms of wins, losses, calls for Trump or Harris in
*  these key southern swing states that will start to give us a feel for whether we're
*  looking at scenarios one, two or three?
*  So in the repudiation scenario, Harris is probably leading in North Carolina and Georgia
*  from the start.
*  And by the time 9 p.m., 10 p.m. rolls around and that Election Day vote is coming in, she's
*  still holding.
*  Maybe she's a little more competitive in floor than people assumed.
*  And Virginia is a comfortable victory for her.
*  Got it.
*  In the Trump realignment scenario, these states may not be close and we could have relatively
*  early calls in Georgia and North Carolina in favor of Trump.
*  He could win them by multiple percentage points.
*  Virginia looks much closer than Democrats hoped and Florida is a landslide.
*  In the toss-up scenario, we may still find that those states are toss-ups by 9 or 10
*  p.m.
*  And we have to wait to see the exact Election Day turn out county by county before we're
*  able to make a call in those states.
*  All right.
*  Which of the southern states should we be watching most closely during this first wave?
*  Georgia and North Carolina, they're really close and they make a huge difference in the
*  College math.
*  Reminder, you need 270 electoral votes to win.
*  If Kamala Harris cannot win either of those two states, then her road to 270 gets very
*  narrow very quickly.
*  She would need to sweep Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in all likelihood to prevail
*  or pull off an upset in Arizona.
*  Which we will get to.
*  Which we will get to.
*  But that would greatly narrow her path to victory.
*  If Donald Trump loses North Carolina and Georgia, his path to 270 looks really challenging at
*  that point.
*  Because he would have to sweep all the northern states.
*  And worse for him, those have been the states where he's tended to pull worse this cycle.
*  So the outcome of these two states will not only tell us a lot about the overall picture
*  of what's happening in the country, it will begin to greatly narrow the range of paths
*  to victory for the two candidates.
*  Okay, let's talk about the next regional wave that will come after the South.
*  And as a reminder, keep us on a kind of evening clock here.
*  So around 9 or 10 p.m., right around the time when it's becoming quite clear what's happened
*  in Georgia and North Carolina, we'll start to get our first clues about what's happening
*  in the northern battleground states.
*  That so-called blue wall of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.
*  The states that Biden won in 2020.
*  The states that Biden won in 2020, that Trump won in 2016.
*  Unlike the southern states, those states are not going to count their votes especially
*  fast.
*  We're going to be watching the count there in all likelihood all night.
*  Let me just ask you why.
*  Why is it going to take Midwestern states longer to count than the South?
*  Presumably, they all have the same technology.
*  Well, they're not necessarily using the same technology, oddly enough.
*  But there are two broad reasons why the North will take longer.
*  One is the different laws about mail ballots.
*  In some northern states like Pennsylvania, they can't begin to even open the mail ballots
*  until the morning of the election.
*  In the southern states, they can begin processing those ballots well before election day.
*  As a result, Florida can have all of its mail ballots processed and ready to go when the
*  polls close.
*  Pennsylvania will not.
*  So it's as simple as in some of these southern states, the minute that the voting ends in
*  those mail and ballots, they're in the count.
*  And in a place like Pennsylvania, they may still be opening the mail.
*  That's right.
*  And this is where the technology oddly winds up being relevant because there are actually
*  huge differences in the technology available to different counties.
*  And the way they open envelopes, for instance, that's done with a machine.
*  Some machines can open 100,000 ballots an hour.
*  Some open 20,000.
*  So what a country.
*  Each county is doing it differently.
*  So that can create very different rates of counting mail ballots, not only by state,
*  but even within different parts of the state.
*  And how should we be thinking about who wins which of these northern states and what it's
*  going to mean to our 270 to win math?
*  As I just mentioned, if Trump wins North Carolina and Georgia, then Harris probably needs to
*  sweep all three of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to prevail with a very narrow
*  electoral college majority.
*  In that same scenario, I'm guessing she's not winning these states and blowouts either.
*  So it could take a very long time to have an outcome.
*  If Harris has won North Carolina, then Harris can afford to lose in Michigan or Wisconsin.
*  But not Pennsylvania.
*  Unless she makes up for it with Nevada later on.
*  But then we have a lot of complicated scenarios where a lot of different doors are open.
*  So just to close out the North, when, as best you can guess, will we have calls in these
*  northern states?
*  So the answer varies a lot by state.
*  They each have different procedures for how they count their votes.
*  I will say Michigan and Wisconsin are better.
*  Those states, I think, a call in the early morning hours or early the next day, very
*  realistic.
*  The one with the most uncertainty is Pennsylvania.
*  As I mentioned, this is the state where they can't start opening their ballots until the
*  morning of the election.
*  So all of this comes down to just how many of these envelopes they can open and how many
*  of these ballots they can process.
*  In 2020, they didn't get even close to counting all of them on Election Day and it took us
*  a week before we had a call.
*  I think there's a lot of reason to think it's going to be much better than 2020.
*  I don't know, however, if that means they count 75% of the mail vote or 95% of the mail
*  vote.
*  And that will make a huge difference in terms of whether we will know the outcome in Pennsylvania
*  on election night.
*  Right.
*  And of course, Pennsylvania is potentially the state we will be waiting on for an overall
*  call in the race, especially if, as you previously told us, Donald Trump sweeps the South.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's worth remembering that Harris is the candidate who leads the mail vote.
*  So all the mail.
*  Mail, not as in men, women, but as an absentee mail ballots.
*  As a result, if they can't tabulate all the mail ballots on election night, then Trump
*  will have more and more of a lead on election night and the result gets more mirage.
*  The more of those ballots they get through, the less mirage it gets and the likelier we
*  are to know the outcome.
*  Got it.
*  All to say, compared with the South, the North is likely to be, in many scenarios, a bit
*  messier and a lot longer.
*  That's right.
*  I think that if someone's winning comfortably, we could know by the next morning.
*  But if it's really close, then it could take days.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay, Nate, we're back and we need to cover the next and I suspect final phase of swing
*  states tonight and when we're going to know things.
*  Yep, the final phase is the West, which we will be watching for weeks and weeks to come.
*  Weeks?
*  Weeks.
*  Unlike the Northern states and the Southern states, I think the count in Arizona, Nevada,
*  California and so on is going to be just as slow as it was four years ago.
*  I don't remember how slow it was.
*  Well, it took a week to call Arizona.
*  Nevada, Biden won pretty decisively and they still couldn't call it until Saturday.
*  And you may recall in the 2022 midterm is that the House was not called for nine days
*  as we waited on California.
*  I think all of those timelines are still plausible in 2024.
*  And I'm going to guess that has to do with some combination of the time difference there
*  as well as mail-in ballot counting rules.
*  It's all about the procedures for counting these mail ballots.
*  How many mail ballots will arrive after election day is one huge variable in Nevada and California.
*  Whether they count any mail ballots that were returned at drop boxes on election day, also
*  a big variable.
*  That's one thing that keeps Arizona going.
*  So the bottom line is, while we can imagine scenarios where states like Pennsylvania count
*  all of their mail ballots by poll closing, it's not going to happen in Arizona.
*  And almost all of the vote in Arizona is by mail.
*  So we're just not going to have the full count.
*  It's not going to happen.
*  Okay, well, walk us through how the Western states fit into our 270 math as well as our
*  three scenarios based on what we've already established in the South and in the North.
*  So there is some good news here.
*  If you could choose two battleground states not to know the result of on election night,
*  you would choose Nevada and Arizona.
*  Why?
*  Nevada is the smallest.
*  It only fits into the electoral math under a pretty narrow set of circumstances.
*  Such as?
*  There's in particular a scenario where Harris loses Pennsylvania but has made up for it
*  partly, but not completely, by winning either North Carolina and Georgia.
*  Then she needs Nevada to make up for the three electoral vote gap between Pennsylvania and
*  North Carolina and Georgia.
*  Fascinating.
*  So that's a narrow scenario, but it's one where it really matters.
*  Arizona is a larger battleground state, but it's not a very large battleground state.
*  And of the seven battlegrounds, Arizona is the one state where a candidate seems to have
*  a modestly clear lead.
*  And that's Donald Trump who's led the polls by three points.
*  As a result, it doesn't loom as heavily in our thinking of either candidate's clearest
*  path to 270 electoral votes in a close election.
*  But there are two other reasons why it's important that the West will take a long time to count
*  its votes.
*  One reason is the House.
*  The House promises to be very closely fought.
*  And there are a lot of contested congressional races in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, California.
*  Non-swing states, but with lots of swing districts.
*  So if the House is relatively close, we're not even going to be close to making a projection
*  for overall House control until the mail ballots at West get counted.
*  And again, that can be days or weeks.
*  The second reason that it matters that the West takes so long to count is the national
*  popular vote.
*  California is going to be Harris' largest prize in the electoral college, and she'll
*  win the popular vote there by millions of votes.
*  Those votes are not going to be counted on election night.
*  And so if the national vote is relatively close, let's say Harris is only going to win
*  in the end by one point, Trump is going to lead in the national popular vote on election
*  night because those Western mail-in ballots haven't been counted yet.
*  And that, of course, would have real implications for his growing and false claims of election
*  fraud.
*  They would very likely feed into him potentially even claiming victory prematurely.
*  Absolutely.
*  It would be used to cast doubt on the results in the battleground states if, hypothetically,
*  Harris had actually won the battlegrounds while still trailing in the national popular
*  vote.
*  And then if Harris does ultimately take the lead in the popular vote, whether that's
*  hours, days or weeks later, that will also be used as a sign that the Democrats were
*  trying to shift it at the end in the same way that in 2020 the slow count was used to
*  sow doubts about the results in states like Pennsylvania.
*  Right.
*  In all these scenarios, there will be a kind of red mirage that would eventually turn slightly
*  blue, and that could create an opportunity for some serious confusion.
*  That's right.
*  National popular vote, you should expect a modest red mirage.
*  I do have to say, and I say this from a comfortable position here on the East Coast, I don't hear
*  any talk of a mirage here.
*  I don't hear any talk of big delays.
*  I'm not saying we're better or worse than any other region of the country.
*  I'm just saying.
*  You know, I have to tell you that New York City did a terrible job counting the vote
*  in 2020.
*  We kind of always do.
*  Yeah.
*  It's been pretty bad here.
*  No, if that's the insult I would be throwing at our friends out west.
*  Fine.
*  I want to ask a different question about the chronology of the night.
*  Let's assume for just a minute that there has been some level of systemic polling error,
*  and it is going to be a decisive win for either Trump or Harris.
*  Perhaps some of these delays we're talking about then don't matter as much.
*  And when do we expect to get a full race call if it's decisive?
*  Are we talking before, just to use an example, the next day's daily comes out at 6 a.m.
*  Wednesday morning?
*  Yes.
*  In that scenario, I think that the count is fast enough for a clear victory to be called
*  on election night, like an Obama 2012 style victory, where you win the key states by four
*  or five points.
*  If it's closer than that, of course, that could take a long time, obviously.
*  Okay.
*  But if there's a clear victory in the southern states or in the northern states, that we
*  should know on election night.
*  On behalf of people at home wondering at what point in the actually it's going to be really
*  close scenario, do you say to yourself, go to bed?
*  There's no call.
*  I mean, I remember walking around zombie like in 2020 because there wasn't a call on Tuesday.
*  There wasn't a call on Wednesday.
*  There wasn't a call on Thursday.
*  There wasn't a call on Friday.
*  It came Saturday morning.
*  I was in a car driving on the highway.
*  I luckily had my microphone with me.
*  But like, you know, we waited, we waited, and it was genuinely a ride.
*  Pennsylvania is the key variable here.
*  And it just comes down to how many of these mail ballots they successfully process on
*  election day.
*  If they process all of them, we'll know that I think on election night.
*  And there may not be much of a way.
*  And you should stay up.
*  If they don't, and it comes down to Pennsylvania, which it probably will, go to bed.
*  Okay.
*  You are about to go off.
*  You're going to walk out the studio.
*  You're going to set up systems and processes to count.
*  You're going to be consumed by this for the next, I don't know, 20 hours.
*  More than that.
*  My true final question to you is, are you going to make time for us tonight if we need
*  you?
*  Because the country, you know, the country needs the guide to guide when we get a result
*  or don't get a result.
*  How early do you need me?
*  I don't know, Mike.
*  I suppose we're going to try to tape around 3 a.m.
*  I think 3, 3 30 is probably the last minute we can record.
*  There should be a window in that range where we've gotten most of what we're going to get
*  on election night and I can come away from my computer to talk to you.
*  Please come.
*  I'll do my best.
*  Your country needs you.
*  The listeners need you.
*  Meanwhile, thank you very much, Nate.
*  As always, we really appreciate it.
*  Thanks for having me, Michael.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Speaking of the election, we want to hear from you.
*  Once the election is called and a winner is declared, record a voice memo on your phone
*  and tell us a few things.
*  Your name, where you live, and how you feel about the outcome.
*  Your immediate reaction, your hopes and fears for President-elect Trump or Harris, and how
*  your life could change as a result of their victory.
*  Keep it relatively short, less than two minutes, and send the file to thedailyatnytimes.com.
*  That's thedailyatnytimes.com with the subject line, reaction.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Hello to Pennsylvania, a very special place.
*  So, Pennsylvania, I'm here to ask for your vote.
*  I'm here to ask for your vote.
*  On the final day of the campaign, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump barnstormed across Pennsylvania.
*  From the very start of our campaign, this has not been about a fight that is against
*  something.
*  This is about a fight that is for something.
*  During a series of rallies, Harris framed her campaign against Trump as a battle between
*  unity and division and between tyranny and freedom.
*  I say that I am not going to be a leader who thinks that people who disagree with me
*  should be put in jail, that they are the enemy.
*  I'll give them a seat at the table because that's what real leaders do and that's what
*  strong leaders do.
*  During a set of competing rallies, Trump described the stakes of today's election.
*  Very differently.
*  Over the past four years, Kamala has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader
*  in American history has ever inflicted upon our people.
*  He portrayed it as a choice between patriotism and radicalism, and between unchecked immigration
*  and a secure border.
*  We will not be invaded.
*  We will not be occupied.
*  We will not be overrun.
*  We are an occupied country.
