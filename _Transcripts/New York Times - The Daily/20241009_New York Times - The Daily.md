# The Parents Aren’t All Right
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Z1_xhlE-Rw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  For years, research on hyper attentive parenting has focused on all the ways that it can hurt
*  children.
*  But now, the US government is reframing that conversation and asking how our new era of
*  parenting is actually bad for parents themselves.
*  Today, my colleague Claire Kane-Miller on why raising children is now a risk to your
*  health.
*  It's Wednesday, October 9th.
*  Claire, thank you for doing this episode with us.
*  This is going to be an interesting conversation because inevitably, I suspect, it's going
*  to end up being a little bit about us.
*  We're both parents and we're talking about parenting.
*  Yeah.
*  How old are your kids?
*  Mine are two and three.
*  Mine are eight and 12.
*  I win.
*  You're in a busier phase, that's for sure.
*  Right.
*  And by when I mean, my situation is a little more challenging, but just a little, just
*  a little.
*  Bigger kids, bigger problems is what they say.
*  It becomes less physically demanding, but it's more mentally demanding.
*  All right.
*  Maybe you win.
*  So, I want to start by asking you to describe what our Surgeon General just said about parents
*  and parenting.
*  Not a subject we tend to think of as a classic question of public health and the Surgeon
*  General.
*  So, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, put out an advisory.
*  These are rare warnings.
*  Just ones have been for things like cigarettes or gun violence.
*  And this time, what he's saying is that today's parents are not okay.
*  They're too stressed.
*  Not the normal amount of stress.
*  But what he's saying is that parenting has become so difficult that it's become an urgent
*  public health crisis.
*  Huh.
*  Basically slapping a warning on the business of parenting.
*  Right.
*  And why?
*  Exactly.
*  I'm sure he has a very good explanation, but just on its face, parenting has never been
*  easy.
*  It will never be easy.
*  That's right.
*  And he does say parenting has always been something that brings both joy and challenge
*  at the same time.
*  But what's really different now is that we have entered this new era of parenting.
*  Social scientists call it intensive parenting.
*  Basically, what it means is that we spend a lot more time and money on our children
*  than previous generations did.
*  Intensive parenting was first described by a sociologist named Sharon Hayes.
*  And this is how she said it.
*  Child-centered, expert-guided, emotionally absorbing, labor-intensive, and financially
*  expensive.
*  The basic idea of intensive parenting, which I've reported on now for many years as it's
*  gotten even more intensive, is that kids need to be sort of constantly educated and enriched
*  and engaged.
*  Right.
*  It feels like in layman's terms, intensive parenting is being all up in your kid's business
*  and feeling like parenting is a 24-hour job where you're very invested in your children's
*  social and intellectual growth in a very hands-on way.
*  That's right.
*  And so that's like when you take a walk and you notice that the leaves are changing.
*  You say to your child, look, the leaves are changing.
*  Do you know what drives that?
*  Do you know why that's happening?
*  That means that when they're doing a game on the floor that you are down with them.
*  I feel like you've been watching me secretly in my kitchen with them.
*  And I mean, of course, this is how children learn, right?
*  But it's really gotten to an extreme.
*  The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, says that when children watch TV, it should
*  be co-viewed.
*  The parent should be sitting with them, watching TV with them, hitting pause to talk about
*  what's happening on TV, what they can learn from it.
*  And I mean, I think a lot of parents have used TV as their chance to go in the room
*  and cook dinner.
*  So this idea that when we are with our kids, we need to be constantly engaged in teaching
*  them.
*  I want to ask you, Claire, if what you're describing, this concept of intensive parenting,
*  is widespread enough to be a public health crisis, I would imagine that what you're describing
*  might be the province of certain parents who have the financial wherewithal and in
*  a sense, the luxury to parent in this intensive way, and therefore that it might not be a
*  vast widespread collective experience and therefore perhaps not a nationwide public
*  health issue.
*  So when this style of parenting started, it was certainly an upper middle class phenomenon.
*  But a variety of research has shown that it has spread across the income spectrum, across
*  racial groups, that this is now considered by parents the optimal way to parent your
*  children.
*  If you have less money, if you have a job that allows for less time at home, you obviously
*  have less ability to carry it out, but you still feel the pressure.
*  So in some ways, that's even more stressful.
*  Okay, so we're all basically intensive parenting now.
*  And why?
*  Why are we participating in this stressful, intensive, hands-on, never-ending form of
*  parenting?
*  So a lot of things began to change around the time that we began to do this.
*  One is that kids born in the early 80s, when you and I were both born, are the first generation
*  of kids in America to have just as much of a chance of doing better than their parents
*  financially as worse.
*  Before it was sort of a definition of the American dream that each generation did a
*  little bit better.
*  And that is no longer a guarantee.
*  So there's this anxiety that kids won't do well, that they will fall out of their class,
*  that they need to really have the utmost education and enrichment in order to succeed as adults.
*  One way that that started to show up was that college became a lot more competitive and
*  much more necessary for achieving this middle-class wage.
*  What the social scientists I talk to say is that our society has become so worried about
*  the importance of a college degree, about this fear that your kids will grow up to be
*  unsuccessful adults and not be able to support themselves.
*  And how that filters down is that we feel this pressure to sort of be optimizing our
*  kids all the time, optimizing their resumes, preparing them for college, preparing them
*  for this future in a way that parents really didn't feel that stress before.
*  So intensive parenting should be viewed as a kind of striving parenting, driven by economic
*  insecurity, like a kind of guarantor of, people hope, a better outcome for their children
*  at a time when there are very few assurances that their children will do as well or better
*  than them.
*  That's fascinating.
*  That's exactly it.
*  And you know, as norms change, you look around and you see other people doing it.
*  And so even for parents who this might not be top of mind, it sort of just gets in the
*  air that we breathe that our kids need to do all these things in order to succeed.
*  You started, Claire, to hint at this idea that intensive parenting is a break from what
*  came before it.
*  And I think it would be useful to situate this new form of parenting that the Surgeon
*  General has just identified as problematic in a larger history of how parents in this
*  country have parented.
*  Right.
*  So the way that we parent changes a lot over the decades.
*  And in recent years, every change has increased the pressure on parents.
*  If we go back to the 70s, that's when parent was still a noun.
*  No one used it as a verb.
*  It was something we were, not something we did.
*  Parents by and large did adult things when their children just occupied themselves.
*  So they were more likely to do things in the presence of children, but not with their children.
*  Maybe they were playing tennis and their children were on the playground nearby, or
*  they were having drinks with their friends in the living room and their kids were in
*  the other room playing alone.
*  You know, we hear a lot of older people talk about how different childhood is today.
*  And what I always hear them say is, we used to run around until the streetlights came
*  on, or we used to run around until our mom called us in for dinner.
*  And there's some truth to that.
*  At the same time, this is when the women's movement is really ramping up.
*  More and more women are going to college and entering the workforce.
*  And so for the first time, parents are really having to grapple with what that means when
*  both parents are working outside the home.
*  There was a moment when people were really advocating for the government to step in and
*  help families solve this problem through policies like subsidized childcare or paid family leave.
*  Those things ultimately didn't happen.
*  That cemented an essential piece of the American attitude towards parenting, which is that
*  it's an individual task.
*  It's not a community one.
*  It's not one that you can count on the government to help you with.
*  So the government basically is saying to American families in this new era of two-parent working
*  households, you're on your own.
*  That's right.
*  In the 80s, we enter a new phase of parenting that becomes much more hands-on and parenting
*  becomes a verb, not just a noun.
*  And this was also a time when parenting books just exploded.
*  We started getting this idea that we needed to listen to experts, that we couldn't trust
*  our own intuition about parenting, that we needed to learn how to do this, that this
*  was a job we did.
*  And this, the 80s, is also when we got helicopter parenting.
*  Basically, what that meant was that children's physical safety became paramount.
*  This was the era when there were a few high-profile child abductions.
*  Abductions have never actually been common in America.
*  They weren't then, they aren't now.
*  But there were these kids' faces on milk cartons.
*  A thousand children disappeared, many of them from nice, safe neighborhoods.
*  It's okay.
*  Come on, help me.
*  Talk to your children about not talking to strangers and do it today.
*  Right, this is the era where I grew up.
*  So it's A-Town Pats being kidnapped in New York.
*  It's Adam Walsh, whose dad would go on to create America's Most Wanted.
*  This becomes very scary for people, even though, as you said, it's never that widespread.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So there was this idea that kids needed to be constantly watched and supervised.
*  Playing and running around in the street after school on your own, that was no longer safe.
*  It's 10 p.m.
*  Do you know where your children are?
*  So if you watched TV in the 80s, you probably remember a famous PSA.
*  Celebrities were filming it.
*  It's 10 p.m.
*  Do you know where your children are?
*  Andy Warhol.
*  Hey, it's 10 p.m.
*  Do you know where your children are?
*  Cyndi Lauper.
*  This idea of physical safety spread to other things.
*  Falling off your bike, falling out of a tree if an adult wasn't there, that was unsafe.
*  There was this idea that parents sort of needed to be hovering over their kids,
*  making sure that they were safe and that they were supervised.
*  But it is not yet at this point in the 80s really about the intellectual development
*  and enrichment and the idea that you're always supposed to be teaching your children.
*  It's more about you're always supposed to be protecting them.
*  So how do we get to that final frontier of parenting where we began?
*  Intensive parenting.
*  Because so far we're just in this area of parents stressed out by worries mostly about their kids' safety.
*  So by the late 1990s, we're influenced by a lot of the things we've already discussed.
*  There's rising economic anxiety.
*  There's rising competition for college.
*  There's still this lack of public policy to support parents.
*  There's also something new.
*  Neuroscientists start to learn more about young children's brains and how parents
*  and the way that they interact with their children can influence that.
*  And parents really grasp onto this idea that every interaction they have with their child
*  is shaping who they're ultimately going to become.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Claire, tell us about the brain science that ends up driving or helping to drive this final era of parenting,
*  intensive parenting that we're in now.
*  So neuroscientists really begin to focus on the fact that children's brains are moldable.
*  For a long time, it was sort of just assumed that your kid was born with this temperament
*  and the certain set of skills, and they would sort of turn out the way they were going to turn out.
*  But neuroscience began to show us that the things that happen to us when we're young
*  can have lifelong effects on our outcomes.
*  From birth to age three are the most important years in a child's brain development,
*  the time that defines who they become.
*  We talk about adverse childhood experiences when kids are exposed to trauma or severe stress,
*  that that can cause problems later on.
*  Did you know that the pathways in your infant's brain that deal with emotions are built and
*  strengthened when you respond day after day to your baby's smiles by smiling back or picking him up?
*  We also learned that when kids are exposed to education and enrichment early on,
*  that that can mold their brains in a certain way.
*  Talk, laugh, sing, and play peekaboo often so that children hear you speak.
*  We get this research about the number of words that kids hear before they're a certain age
*  and how this can impact their vocabularies and reading comprehension later on.
*  This is when we got Baby Mozart, this idea that you would play
*  classical music outside your belly when your baby was in utero,
*  because there was this science that suggested that this molded their brain in certain ways.
*  You know at this moment in the episode we have to play Baby Mozart.
*  I'm excited to hear it.
*  But some parents take this to an extreme with this idea that parental inputs
*  entirely shape a child's outcomes and what they become.
*  What that does to parents is makes them feel like at every turn, at every moment,
*  it's their responsibility to be shaping their children's future outcomes.
*  Fast forward a couple decades and this kind of intensive parenting
*  has only gotten more intensive and according to America's top doctor, too intense for parents.
*  Give us a little bit more of a sense of what that looks like.
*  You mentioned at the beginning of our conversation the tendency to
*  describe the leaf falling from the tree, but I really want to get kind of granular around this
*  idea of what intensive parenting focused on the responsibility of a parent to shape early outcomes
*  because those mean later outcomes actually looks and feels like.
*  So a statistic I think about all the time from my reporting on this is that working mothers today
*  spend as much time with their children as stay at home mothers did in the 1970s.
*  Wow, how's that possible?
*  Well, one of the driving factors of intensive parenting is this feeling of guilt,
*  especially maternal guilt for working outside the home.
*  And there's this feeling that as a result, when you're not working,
*  you need to be spending all your time with your children.
*  So today it's much, much more likely that your children are involved in your leisure time.
*  They're involved in your exercise time, which is to say it's no longer exercise time.
*  They're no longer playing on the playground while you're playing tennis with your friends.
*  They're instead playing tennis with you, right?
*  Time use data has shown that what this comes at the expense of is parents sleep,
*  parents doing things for their own health and parents spending time
*  alone with friends or their spouse.
*  And that very much sounds like a more stressful form of parenting
*  that the Surgeon General is talking about.
*  I mean, when parents have so little time to themselves and therefore so little identity
*  of their own outside of parenting and their work, that is a less enjoyable form of parenting, period.
*  That's right.
*  And another thing the Surgeon General raised was social media and the sense of comparison.
*  There have been a lot of surveys that say parents really feel judged by other parents.
*  So social media, because it's showing the victories in children's lives and it's showing
*  these happy family moments, is really making people who see it feel less than, feel insecure,
*  feel like they're not measuring up in this world in which they're already feeling like
*  the way that they're parenting and juggling everything is not measuring up.
*  Right. Instagram, some people say the great envy machine.
*  That's right. And I don't know about you.
*  Quick tip for parents who want to raise confident kids.
*  But when I open Instagram now.
*  Okay, when you discipline your kids, keep it short and sweet.
*  No long lectures. Don't tell them.
*  What I see, you know, not even accounts that I follow is a bunch of parenting advice.
*  This is a back to school hack you don't want to miss.
*  It's like Dr. Becky.
*  I make a menu for my kids the night before where they have to pick their breakfast options.
*  Telling me how to parent. And so it's either seeing these happy families or seeing these
*  experts telling me what I need to be doing differently. And it's sort of feeding this
*  insecurity.
*  It's as simple as this. When you say we're all done with iPad after that one show,
*  you are all done with iPad after that one show.
*  Oh, yeah. There's a couple of them who are like everywhere and they're always in front
*  of a microphone and they're always saying things that you're like, oh, it's totally
*  not how I handled that.
*  Yep. Yep. Exactly.
*  And so all these concerns and pressures have really added up. What the surgeon general is
*  talking about is potentially toxic stress. Clearly major stressors like living through
*  a war have immediate serious impacts on people. But research also shows that sort of low level
*  persistent chronic stress have really big effects on people's mental health. And it also
*  puts parents at risk of more serious mental illness like anxiety and depression.
*  The surgeon general cites data that shows that nearly half of parents say that most
*  days they feel completely overwhelmed by the stress, numb, or even non-functional.
*  And that's compared with only a quarter of people who aren't parents.
*  Right. So I clearly, from what you're saying, understand this stew of factors, economic,
*  social, social media that have conspired to make parenting the stressful experience it now is.
*  And stressful to the point of, as you just said, depression, feeling numb.
*  But to be provocative for just a moment, I want to put all of that to the test. Is it possible,
*  based especially on the brain science that you talked about earlier, that intensive parenting
*  for all of the ways that it's bad for parents is good for most kids. So good, in fact, that it's
*  still worth it. So here's the thing. Nobody disputes that parents being engaged with their
*  children, spending time with them, teaching them things is a bad thing. That is, of course,
*  a good thing. But there is a backlash. You might have heard of the free range parenting movement.
*  It's basically this idea that kids should still be able to run free until the streetlights come on.
*  These are parents who are actively resisting both the helicopter parenting and the intensive
*  parenting. The problem with free range parenting is that there are no other kids out in the street
*  after school for their kids to run free with. Right. What's the point of a free range kid
*  if he has no other free range kids to free range with? It's quite hard to implement.
*  There have been very valid concerns that this kind of parenting could be decreasing kids
*  independence and their resilience, their ability to solve problems on their own.
*  What does the science say about that? There has been science that connects
*  kids' lack of independence today to some of the mental health crisis that we're seeing among kids.
*  There's something to be said for kids being out there, getting into a conflict, being scared,
*  having to solve a problem on their own that helps them understand that anxiety and stress
*  are something that they can cope with and build that toolbox to cope with it.
*  There is some truth to that. However, most parents are not doing it to that extreme.
*  They're not letting their kids solve no problems on their own. I recently did a story that I thought
*  was really fascinating because it was not the result I expected, which is that young adults
*  who have been raised this way are still really close with their parents, closer than in previous
*  generations. They're talking to them more often. They're texting them. Both the parents and the
*  kids are happy with this. They're just having a full adult relationship with their parents.
*  That is probably a good thing.
*  Right. That feels like a pretty healthy, desirable dynamic. However, if we inhabit the space of our
*  surgeon general and take at face value the idea that in this new era of parenting, parents are
*  facing a kind of public health problem, I'm curious what the surgeon general thinks are some
*  of the solutions that might mitigate the parent problem of that equation.
*  Sure. He proposed a lot of big structural solutions, things like public policies, paid family
*  leave, subsidized childcare at a time when childcare has gotten so much more expensive.
*  He talked about workplace changes, employers better helping parents manage the juggle and
*  understand that their workers have lives outside of work. He talked about changes in healthcare,
*  healthcare providers being more aware of parents' mental health. Surely these things would all make
*  big differences, provide relief for parents. They're also things that people have been working on
*  for a long time and it's slow going. What I thought was really interesting is he also talked about
*  cultural changes. The reason we parent this way is because it's become our culture. That means that
*  we could also change the culture. It sounds pie in the sky, changing the culture. It sounds very
*  difficult for individual people to achieve, but he mentioned these really small things like if you
*  have a friend with a baby, go over for 15 minutes and offer to hold the baby while they take a shower
*  or take a nap. He talked about the need for more community spaces, places like parks and libraries
*  where families can get out of sort of the insular household and interact with other families, maybe
*  to get some support watching their children, but also to talk about these things. He even said that
*  parents should not feel guilt when they take time for themselves to exercise or take a nap or go out
*  with friends. That's really important to do for their own health and ultimately if you're in better
*  mental health then that helps your children too. What does he say about how your spouse makes you
*  feel when you take that nap though? Maybe you could trade off nap times and maybe at the end
*  of the evening you could also get a babysitter and go out with your spouse. Totally, just asking
*  questions here. All right, well I have to end this by asking about you. You have become a real authority
*  on parenting at The Times. You brought us this reporting about intensive parenting and the Surgeon
*  General's report. Are you yourself an intensive parent or I'm pretty much sure the answer is going
*  to be yes and to the degree that you are, how stressed are you? How much are you reevaluating
*  all of this and are you contemplating any kind of corrective of any kind? Are you willing to start
*  to free range a little bit? Well of course I'm an intensive parent because it's hard not to be these
*  days but I do take this to heart. I try to catch myself. There was this moment when my younger son
*  was in kindergarten and I heard another parent talking about how her kindergartener had a tutor
*  and I was like oh my god that hadn't occurred to me. Do I need a tutor? The same child was in rec
*  soccer in kindergarten and went back in first grade and there were no more kids from his school
*  on the soccer team. So you know I texted some of the parents and said where are they? They're like
*  we signed up for private club. It's time to do private club when they're seven years old and I
*  was like oh my god do I need to do that? And I have caught myself and you know not done those
*  things. Caught yourself and said I don't need to give into this pressure. That's right. I don't need
*  to give into this pressure. You know I have had moments where I'm like you know what you go to
*  the basement and watch tv for an hour and I'm not going to feel guilty about this because I am
*  parenting non-intensively right now. So I do feel some sense of like you can let go of the guilt and
*  embrace that a little bit. All right well Claire this has been extremely illuminating
*  and I'm grateful for your time. Thank you very much. Thanks for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today. If you're going to get out, get out now. Time will be
*  running out very shortly if you wait any longer. On Tuesday millions of Floridians evacuated their
*  homes as Hurricane Milton approached the state's west coast. Forecasters are calling Milton the
*  strongest storm to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico in 20 years. During a series of news conferences
*  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned that the storm's lethal force would extend across the
*  Florida peninsula and would likely flood communities that are still recovering from the
*  state's last hurricane. A lot of the places on the west coast of Florida that did receive significant
*  storm surge for Hurricane Helene is projected to have even more storm surge from Hurricane Milton.
*  And the scandal-plagued administration of New York City Mayor Eric Adams is collapsing.
*  On Tuesday his first Deputy Mayor resigned becoming the seventh senior official to leave
*  the Mayor's office over the past few weeks. Adams himself is under growing pressure to resign
*  after being indicted on federal corruption charges for allegedly accepting illegal campaign donations
*  and gifts from the government of Turkey in return for political favors.
