# The Weekend Democrats Went to War — Against Each Other
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Over the past few days, a routine debate over government funding has exploded into an angry [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=11.94s)]
*  showdown over the Democratic Party's identity in the Trump era and whether its current leadership [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=18.0s)]
*  is right for the moment. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  Today, I speak with my colleagues, congressional reporter Katie Edmondson and national political [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=27.04s)]
*  correspondent Shane Goldmacher about the weekend that rocked the Democratic Party. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=33.2s)]
*  It's Monday, March 17th. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Hey there, Katie. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=50.24s)]
*  Hey, Michael. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=56.2s)]
*  You have many options of how to spend your Sunday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=58.04s)]
*  Appreciate you spending it with us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=60.6s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=61.6s)]
*  So Katie, pretty much from the moment that Donald Trump was inaugurated for the second [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=64.04s)]
*  term, there has been this low-grade debate playing out inside the Democratic Party about [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=68.92s)]
*  how to counter him and what Democrats can do and should do about his really aggressive [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=74.76s)]
*  strategy of firing thousands of government workers, shutting down agencies, circumventing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=80.28s)]
*  Congress in the process. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=86.0s)]
*  And the question has been, when would that internal debate really come to a head and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  become a public battle? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=93.04s)]
*  And the answer, it seems, is right now, because it all really just became a public brawl over [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=95.16000000000001s)]
*  the past few days. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=102.72s)]
*  And that all seems to revolve around the actions of the Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=104.88s)]
*  of New York. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=110.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=111.24s)]
*  I mean, look, I think there was behind the scenes for weeks now a lot of quiet agonizing [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=112.24s)]
*  over how to counter the Trump administration. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=117.63999999999999s)]
*  And that sort of quiet agonizing turned into very public anger this week. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=120.44s)]
*  And it all burst out into the open this week when Senator Chuck Schumer made a judgment [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=126.8s)]
*  call essentially about the best way to combat the Trump administration right now. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=131.48s)]
*  And immediately that decision faced blowback from sort of all corners of the Democratic [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=136.6s)]
*  Party. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  Right, who said basically, we think you made the wrong call. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=145.88s)]
*  As of now, there is at least one major liberal activist group off of Capitol Hill, Indivisible, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=146.88s)]
*  that has called for Senator Schumer to step down as the party's leader in the Senate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=152.2s)]
*  Perhaps most interesting at least to me was you saw some dissension from his counterpart [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  over in the House. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=163.88s)]
*  Is it time for new leadership in the Senate? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=164.88s)]
*  Next question. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=168.0s)]
*  Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York was pressed multiple times at a news conference [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=169.0s)]
*  on Capitol Hill on Friday as to whether he still had confidence in Schumer as the Senate [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=175.23999999999998s)]
*  Minority Leader. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Have you lost confidence in him, the fact that you guys see this so differently? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  And Congressman Jeffries' response each time was the same, which was to say, next question. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=186.36s)]
*  Right, a remarkable moment where basically the number two Democrat in Congress won't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=191.08s)]
*  say whether he supports the number one Senate Democrat. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=197.28s)]
*  That's a huge, huge deal. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=201.64000000000001s)]
*  It was a stunning moment and it was really remarkable to see this very public fissure. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=203.56s)]
*  Well, tell us how we got to this moment in such a short period of time where Democrats [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=210.24s)]
*  are truly, it seems, at each other's throat about the best way to operate in this first [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=219.24s)]
*  phase of the Trump administration. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=226.16000000000003s)]
*  So it starts with a fairly typical procedure up here on the Hill, which is we're staring [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=228.96s)]
*  down another government funding deadline. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=235.0s)]
*  Governors need to pass something to ensure the government doesn't shut down. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=238.1s)]
*  Right, we've only covered this UNI, Katie, I don't know, 10 times in the last four years, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=241.22s)]
*  something like that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=245.62s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=246.62s)]
*  Although this time the script sort of flips, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=247.62s)]
*  Because normally what you and I are talking about is how these funding decisions pit Republican [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=250.18s)]
*  against Republican. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=254.9s)]
*  But what happened here is actually the opposite, is that for once House Republicans were able [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=256.7s)]
*  to unite around this spending bill that Speaker Mike Johnson unveiled. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=261.76s)]
*  The reason they were able to unite around this is sort of for two reasons. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  One is because it was an entirely Republican written bill. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=271.26s)]
*  Democrats had no input into what this bill looked like at all. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=275.09999999999997s)]
*  But two is because a lot of them were saying, look, it would be bad for President Trump [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=278.9s)]
*  if the government shut down. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=282.94s)]
*  Let's ensure that he can continue the great work his administration is doing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=284.86s)]
*  And that is actually what happened. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=289.58s)]
*  House Republicans were able to pass this stopgap spending bill with really minimal [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=291.78s)]
*  drama on their side, which is I think a fact that shocked a lot of Democrats. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=297.09999999999997s)]
*  And in fact, all Democrats accept one vote against it because they want to show that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=301.61999999999995s)]
*  they are standing up to President Trump and that they're taking a principled stand. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=306.91999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=311.78s)]
*  And normally it's Democrats who end up being needed. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=312.78s)]
*  They end up being summoned to rescue these spending bills to avoid a shutdown. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=315.02s)]
*  You're saying in this case, suddenly they're just kind of left off to the sidelines. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=319.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's absolutely right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=322.18s)]
*  And that infuriates a lot of Democrats. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=323.9s)]
*  They actually fundamentally hate this bill. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=326.58s)]
*  They say that this is a piece of legislation that doesn't have the sort of narrow spending [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=329.5s)]
*  instructions that Congress normally gives the executive branch. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=334.44s)]
*  And so the argument is essentially this bill creates a lot of slush funds for the administration [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=338.42s)]
*  to be able to use however they want. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=343.54s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=345.86s)]
*  In other words, it empowers the Trump administration at a moment where Democrats would like to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=346.86s)]
*  do anything they can to disempower it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=350.7s)]
*  And at a moment where Democratic members of Congress already feel that the executive branch [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=353.66s)]
*  is running absolute roughshod over congressional spending prerogatives. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=357.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=362.14s)]
*  Got it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=363.14s)]
*  So naturally the bill then moves over to the Senate where Republicans are in control, but [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=364.14s)]
*  not so much control that they can just pass a spending bill necessarily on their own. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=369.34000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=374.6s)]
*  If we want to get a final vote on the spending bill, Republicans need to be able to break [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=375.6s)]
*  a filibuster, which means if the bill is allowed to proceed, it's going to require Democratic [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  support. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=385.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=386.04s)]
*  And based on everything you've said so far, I have to think that Senate Democrats are [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=387.04s)]
*  thinking to themselves, well, we can't support this either. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=390.92s)]
*  Well, that is the early indication. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  Funding the government should be a bipartisan effort. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=396.76000000000005s)]
*  In fact, Senator Schumer early in the week comes out and says, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=400.34000000000003s)]
*  Republicans chose a partisan path drafting their continuing resolution without any input, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=404.48s)]
*  any input from congressional Democrats. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=411.02000000000004s)]
*  Because of that, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=414.64000000000004s)]
*  This is not something Democratic senators can support. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  Let's try to draft some sort of bipartisan bill that we can all get behind. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=418.84000000000003s)]
*  Our caucus is unified on a clean CR that will keep the government open and give Congress [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=422.74s)]
*  But clearly that's something Republicans don't want to do. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=431.16s)]
*  And instead, what Democratic senators find themselves faced with is what many of them [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=439.44s)]
*  describe to me as a really agonizing decision. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=444.78000000000003s)]
*  Agonizing why? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  So they're faced with this dilemma, which is which path gives Trump the least amount [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  of leverage? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=454.70000000000005s)]
*  A lot of them, I think, viewed this as a moment to be able to use sort of the little remaining [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=456.68s)]
*  power they have left in Congress in the minority to say, we're going to shut the government [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  down. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  We are not going to vote to allow Trump to continue the status quo. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=467.96000000000004s)]
*  We are going to throw sand in the gears here. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=473.36s)]
*  We will not lend our votes to support what you're doing. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=475.64000000000004s)]
*  Right, just as the House had done, but without any real leverage. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=478.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=481.72s)]
*  The other option that senators are weighing is a lot of them are very concerned that if [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=482.72s)]
*  they do, in fact, vote to filibuster this bill, Democrats will be blamed for shutting [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=487.18s)]
*  the government down, right, which is something that we know voters hate. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  But there's a deeper fear, which is that by shutting the government down, you actually [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=497.58000000000004s)]
*  empower the Trump administration even more. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=501.34000000000003s)]
*  How so? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=504.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, in a shutdown, the Trump administration and specifically the Office of Management [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  which is run by a real conservative hardliner gets to decide which federal workers are deemed [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=511.34s)]
*  essential and which are deemed non-essential. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=516.54s)]
*  So there was a real fear by a number of Democratic senators that this could essentially lead [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=520.42s)]
*  to mass furloughs, could accelerate the mass layoffs we've been seeing of federal workers. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=524.74s)]
*  Basically, turbocharged do's. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=529.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=532.22s)]
*  And there's a second fear, which is if you shut the government down, how can you ever [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=533.22s)]
*  get it back open? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=536.86s)]
*  And there's a specific fear that under the Trump administration and with this Republican [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=538.58s)]
*  Congress, maybe they end up opening only the parts of government they like and letting [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=542.5s)]
*  the parts of government they don't like remain permanently shut down. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=547.64s)]
*  In fact, Senate Democrats met three days in a row for these luncheons that dragged on. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=551.5s)]
*  And you could actually hear sort of them debating, right, yelling during these luncheons because [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=556.5s)]
*  this was a truly difficult decision for so many of them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=563.22s)]
*  But it seems like the way that the room is leaning increasingly is that it is leaning [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=567.86s)]
*  toward a shutdown. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=572.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=573.66s)]
*  And as agonized as they are, they know that their leader, Chuck Schumer, has their back. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=574.66s)]
*  Well, Leader Schumer, in fact, on Thursday at this luncheon shocks many of his members [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=579.78s)]
*  when he stands up and makes the announcement that he is in fact reversing himself and has [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=587.3000000000001s)]
*  made the calculation that it is going to be better for Democrats to vote to support this [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=593.38s)]
*  legislation to clear the way for this bill, that shutting down the government is a bad [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=599.74s)]
*  option for Democrats. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=604.86s)]
*  For all of the reasons, Michael, that we talked about, it would actually empower the Trump [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=607.08s)]
*  administration. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=611.58s)]
*  And he also indicates that he has lined up enough support from other Democrats, of which [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=613.0600000000001s)]
*  he only needs a handful, to basically clear the way to make sure this bill can pass. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=617.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=623.14s)]
*  This is a genuinely surprising moment. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=624.14s)]
*  And this is when the anger that we have been referring to since the very beginning of this [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=627.58s)]
*  conversation really begins to explode. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=632.38s)]
*  This is the moment when a lot of Democratic heads explode. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=636.58s)]
*  I think Senate Democrats, I think the Senate leader made an enormous miscalculation. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=642.82s)]
*  This is not a time where we should be bending the knee to Donald Trump. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=647.9000000000001s)]
*  And there is just immediate fury. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=652.22s)]
*  People feel like this was a moment that was a test for all of our leadership and not to [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=655.0s)]
*  blink and not to cave. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=661.5s)]
*  If you remember all House Democrats except one banded together, stayed united to show [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=663.4200000000001s)]
*  that they were opposing this bill. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=668.86s)]
*  It's not about being progressive. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=671.94s)]
*  It's not about being moderate. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=673.62s)]
*  It's about who is going to be in this fight and push back and fight back. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=674.62s)]
*  And then you have one high profile House Democrat, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=679.34s)]
*  who goes on to CNN. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=684.86s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, I guess your senator, said he is going to vote to allow there to be a [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=686.74s)]
*  simple majority vote. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=690.62s)]
*  You think that's wrong? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  I believe that's a tremendous mistake. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=693.5s)]
*  And says essentially that Schumer is making a huge mistake. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=695.34s)]
*  To me, it is almost unthinkable why Senate Democrats would vote to hand the few pieces [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=698.94s)]
*  of leverage that we have away for free when we've been sent here to protect. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=708.1s)]
*  And then you have Senate Democrats who essentially hear Schumer's call and say, thank you very [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=712.1800000000001s)]
*  much. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=718.4200000000001s)]
*  I will be voting against this bill and post videos on social media saying that. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  They wrote their own partisan bill. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=724.34s)]
*  They filled it with all sorts of right-wing shit. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=726.66s)]
*  I'm voting no. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=729.02s)]
*  I am a no. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=730.1s)]
*  I am a no. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=732.34s)]
*  Basically saying in the most public way imaginable, I disagree with the Senate Democratic leader. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=739.62s)]
*  That's right. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=744.7s)]
*  And then you have kind of the cherry on top, which is when Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=745.7s)]
*  leader, comes back to Washington and gives that press conference in which he refuses [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=749.82s)]
*  to say whether or not he is confident in Schumer's leadership. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=755.24s)]
*  By Friday evening, when Schumer actually has to take this vote out on the floor to allow [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=758.48s)]
*  this spending bill to pass, that in fact only nine other members of the Democratic caucus [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=764.2800000000001s)]
*  vote to join him. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  And so you have a very stark split screen in which a majority of his caucus actually [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=772.0400000000001s)]
*  votes to block the spending bill, votes against his decision. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=776.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=780.48s)]
*  And when you put that together with the House, what you basically see is the majority of [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=781.48s)]
*  congressional Democrats, the vast majority of them, not doing what Chuck Schumer did, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=787.0s)]
*  in fact doing the opposite. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=792.24s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=793.24s)]
*  And look, I do want to say in the Senate, just based off of some of the private conversations [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=794.24s)]
*  I was having with Democrats, I do think there were a number of them who sort of the old [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  adage is vote no, hope yes, hoping that there would not be a shutdown, but knew that their [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=803.64s)]
*  constituents, their voters wanted to see them putting up a good fight against Trump. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think the bottom line is elsewhere in the Democratic Party, off of the Hill, over [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=816.52s)]
*  in the House, you see some real rage directed here at Senator Schumer. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=820.48s)]
*  I can't tell you how many Democratic lawmakers I've spoken to who have said that since the [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=826.1999999999999s)]
*  vote they have had calls from their constituents saying, you know, what are you doing? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=831.12s)]
*  If this is how Trump's government is going to run, we'd really rather you shut it down. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=836.42s)]
*  All of which suggests that the Democratic base and a fair number of Democratic lawmakers [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=841.8199999999999s)]
*  who voted against this, they wanted their party to take a stand here and are quite upset [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=847.14s)]
*  that at the last minute, at the direction of Senator Schumer, the party did not. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=852.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=857.38s)]
*  I mean, look, I think this is going to be the defining question for the Democratic Party [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  in the next weeks and months to come. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=864.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know how it plays out, but what I do know is that there is a very visceral, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=867.06s)]
*  real level of anger from the Democratic base right now. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=873.9399999999999s)]
*  It's actually, I think, more akin to some of the moments we've seen in the past from [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=878.9399999999999s)]
*  the Republican grassroots. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=884.06s)]
*  And so I think that's in part why this is such a startling moment for Democratic officials. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=887.06s)]
*  I mean, they're not used to this from their voters, particularly on this issue. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=893.1s)]
*  And I think they're still trying to figure out exactly how to deal with it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=897.74s)]
*  Well, Katie, thank you very much. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=905.3000000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=907.3000000000001s)]
*  After the break, Shane Goldmacher on how this surge of anger from Democratic voters and [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=914.1s)]
*  lawmakers could change the Democratic Party. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=920.78s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=925.98s)]
*  Shane, happy Sunday. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=935.3399999999999s)]
*  Happy Sunday to you. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=937.02s)]
*  Shane, you've been watching everything that Katie Edmondson just described, especially [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=938.62s)]
*  the anger from Democratic voters with their leaders, which is, Katie, just put it, is [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=943.4599999999999s)]
*  something we tend to associate much more with Republicans than Democratic voters. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=950.02s)]
*  And you have a provocative thought about that and what it could potentially represent. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=954.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's actually a question that I was down in Washington, D.C. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=961.5s)]
*  this week asking Democratic lawmakers and Democratic officials even before this shut [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=965.22s)]
*  down fight exploded. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=972.1s)]
*  And the question I was asking is whether the Democratic Party is facing its own tea [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=974.34s)]
*  party moment. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=979.78s)]
*  Well, just explain just explain that its own tea party moment. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=981.26s)]
*  For years and years, it's been the Republican voters who have been angry and they've been [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=985.42s)]
*  angry at their own party and they've been angry at the Democratic Party. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=990.38s)]
*  And for the first time in many years, Democrats are describing that same kind of anger. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=995.1s)]
*  They're saying that at their town halls, even in deep blue districts, voters are coming [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1001.5s)]
*  up upset and angry and wanting more, more fight, more action, more something. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1006.14s)]
*  And the parallel is really the first year of Barack Obama's first term. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1012.38s)]
*  Right. When the Tea Party actually emerges. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1018.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just take us back there, because I think for this provocative question to really [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1021.3s)]
*  make sense, we're going to need to be reminded of that history. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1026.06s)]
*  So Barack Obama wins and the Democrats have then, just as the Republicans do now, complete [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1030.1s)]
*  control of the federal government. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1038.7399999999998s)]
*  Obama's victory, coupled with massive gains in Congress, puts Democrats firmly in control [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1040.62s)]
*  of Washington. Both chambers of commerce and the White House and the Republican voters [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1045.86s)]
*  were almost immediately angry. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1052.4199999999998s)]
*  Help us do something about the economy. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1055.02s)]
*  They're angry at having lost. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1058.9s)]
*  I am angry at the waste of money in D.C. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1060.6200000000001s)]
*  They're angry at the scale of the defeat. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1063.82s)]
*  And if we don't stand up now, God help us. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1065.82s)]
*  And then they're angry at the Obama agenda. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1068.9s)]
*  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that I will sign today. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1071.22s)]
*  Obama gets this massive stimulus package passed. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1074.82s)]
*  Is the most sweeping economic recovery package in our history. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1078.78s)]
*  And they're angry at how much of the agenda he's enacting and how much Republicans are [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1083.26s)]
*  failing to stop it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1088.7s)]
*  Right. To many Republicans, their leadership, especially in Congress, is feeling ineffectual, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1090.26s)]
*  not up to the task of opposing this powerful president from the opposing party. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1094.18s)]
*  So you start to see this anger at public forums. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1100.22s)]
*  I called your office and I was told I could have the mic to speak. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1105.7s)]
*  And then I was lied to. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  Republicans shouting down Democratic lawmakers about their agenda. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1112.46s)]
*  What are you going to do to restore this country back to what our founders created [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1117.3400000000001s)]
*  according to the Constitution? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1121.5s)]
*  And real activism. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1123.9s)]
*  And you see this anger and activism expressed in Republican primaries all across the country. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1125.74s)]
*  Begin with the major political upset for one of the most powerful Republicans in the country, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1134.38s)]
*  Eric Cantor, the number two GOP lawmaker in the House, beaten in the primary by a Tea Party candidate. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1138.74s)]
*  Where outsider, younger and angrier candidates are suddenly winning. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1145.5400000000002s)]
*  It's not about Dave Brat winning tonight. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1150.5400000000002s)]
*  It's about returning the country to constitutional principles. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1153.38s)]
*  They're beating the old guard of the Republican Party in ways that the party just didn't expect. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1158.42s)]
*  And this anger was changing the Republican Party from within. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1164.14s)]
*  And one of the people elected in this changing of the guard of the Republican Party was [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1168.1000000000001s)]
*  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1173.46s)]
*  And if there's one moment that crystallizes the Tea Party strategy during those years, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1175.82s)]
*  it's what Ted Cruz did in the fall of 2013. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1181.3400000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1185.38s)]
*  Senator from Texas. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1186.5s)]
*  Because this is when he pushed his Republican colleagues to shut down the federal government as a last [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1188.06s)]
*  ditch effort to stop Obamacare. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1193.66s)]
*  Madam President, I intend to speak in opposition to Obamacare. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1196.26s)]
*  I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no longer able to stand. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1200.7s)]
*  And it was clear at the time that Ted Cruz had no path to victory here, that Barack Obama was not going [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1205.94s)]
*  to sign a measure to unwind his signature achievement. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1211.3400000000001s)]
*  But the tactic, it was to fight, it was to fight, and it was to mobilize that anger and say, I am out here [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1214.8200000000002s)]
*  with you. I am willing to have this fight even if we can't win. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1220.7s)]
*  And suddenly you see Democrats in the same place. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1229.9s)]
*  This last week, they were talking about using the exact same tool, shutting down the federal government [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1236.7s)]
*  without necessarily an endgame, that the fight itself was worth having, because if you didn't have the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1242.46s)]
*  fight, you weren't actually speaking to where Democratic voters are. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1248.38s)]
*  Right. And so this explains why your provocative question isn't necessarily that provocative. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1253.3000000000002s)]
*  You're seeing evidence, you're saying, that the Democratic Party's mindset, especially among a group of [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1259.1s)]
*  voters, has changed. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1266.78s)]
*  And suddenly they're asking the question, should we be a party where fighting is the point, even if it means [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1268.74s)]
*  potentially shutting down the government in order to fight President Trump? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1278.02s)]
*  It's anything to avoid the current status quo. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1283.78s)]
*  And to be clear, this energy and this dynamic was there before this shutdown fight and this split inside the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1287.9s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1296.3s)]
*  It sort of begins generationally. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1297.82s)]
*  It's the younger generation of Democratic officials who are expressing the greatest level of frustration. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1300.54s)]
*  In the House of Representatives, there's a private text messaging chain among Democrats who've served for five [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1307.3s)]
*  terms or fewer. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1312.5s)]
*  That means they've only served in the post Trump era. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1313.9s)]
*  The only Republican Party that they have seen is the changed post Tea Party Republican Party. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1317.5s)]
*  Right. The Fight Fight Republican Party. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1324.1000000000001s)]
*  And they want to change the Democratic Party from within. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1326.3400000000001s)]
*  And they're looking to push out and defeat older Democrats in primaries, potentially in open seats. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1329.3000000000002s)]
*  And even on Capitol Hill, this actually began before Trump was sworn in in these obscure races to be the top [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1337.78s)]
*  Democrat on various policy committees. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1345.62s)]
*  There were three more senior Democrats at the end of last year who are all ousted by younger lawmakers who said, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1348.06s)]
*  we need a new face, a more engaged fighter. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1355.34s)]
*  And they won. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1359.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1361.06s)]
*  And Trump's arrival only accelerated that energy on Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail, where I'm already [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1361.6200000000001s)]
*  hearing about congressional primary challenges on a generational basis in multiple states across the country. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1369.46s)]
*  Fascinating. But of course, if we're going to stick with the Tea Party model here of internal insurgency that we [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1377.14s)]
*  might start to see on the Democratic side, I want to reflect on the fact that the Tea Party's overall message was [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1384.82s)]
*  profoundly anti-government. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1391.42s)]
*  Right. It was the government is too big. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1394.1000000000001s)]
*  The government is too invasive. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1397.38s)]
*  And that's not the Democratic Party's brand. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1399.38s)]
*  Democratic Party's brand is generally quite supportive of the government and of its workers. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1404.18s)]
*  That's partly why some Democrats were so alarmed by the idea of pushing the government into a shutdown over the past [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1409.22s)]
*  few days. That's hard for a lot of Democrats to swallow. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1414.94s)]
*  So how do these Democrats who perhaps view the Tea Party as a model for change reconcile that? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1417.5s)]
*  I think this younger generation of Democrats share something else in common, which is that they are experiencing a [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1426.46s)]
*  dimming of the American dream, that it is harder to buy a house, that it is harder to pay for child care, that they [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1433.46s)]
*  no longer believe that they or their children are going to have better futures than their parents. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1440.5s)]
*  And they approach this with an urgency and a need to have a kind of agenda that is more proactive to solve those [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1446.66s)]
*  problems. They want to see the Democratic Party not just fight harder, but propose bigger solutions that meet the [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1453.7s)]
*  kind of frustrations that voters have. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1461.18s)]
*  The same anger at the system that helped bring about Donald Trump. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1463.6200000000001s)]
*  They want to be able to tap into that anger and say, we're not just for the status quo. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1467.8600000000001s)]
*  We're not just defending institutions. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1472.5s)]
*  We want to rebuild them and we have a very specific plan and vision to do it. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1474.1399999999999s)]
*  And frankly, they haven't unified behind one yet, right? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1478.86s)]
*  We're talking about this as a hypothetical, but there is the germs of we need bigger and bolder ideas. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1481.46s)]
*  And it really is a genuine open question inside the Democratic Party of which ideological wing will end up winning [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1488.98s)]
*  out to define what the party actually stands for. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1497.02s)]
*  So this still pretty inchoate vision of a Democratic insurgency so far is fight, fight, but not just fight for its [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1500.3s)]
*  own sake. Fight with an alternative Democratic agenda than what the existing Democratic leadership offers. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1508.58s)]
*  And I'm guessing many of them believe the absence of which doomed President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1515.6599999999999s)]
*  in the last election in which they were seen, the whole party was seen as protectors of the status quo. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1522.5s)]
*  Yeah, the idea is, OK, Elon Musk and Donald Trump want to dismantle the Department of Education, right? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1528.1s)]
*  So the Democratic Party doesn't just want to defend the Department of Education. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1535.34s)]
*  They need a proactive plan for what the Department of Education will actually do for you, for your children. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1540.34s)]
*  They want a plan that says we're not just defending the Department of Education to exist because we're for the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1546.26s)]
*  bureaucracy, right? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1550.98s)]
*  But a plan for how to make that bureaucracy actually work for people. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1552.1s)]
*  And in fact, after I wrote a story about this generational divide at the Democratic Party this week, the most [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1558.22s)]
*  common email I got from people was older readers saying, hey, wait a second, I'm pissed off too. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1564.26s)]
*  Right. And of course, there are old Democrats who have the same energy and there are young Democrats who are more [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1570.8600000000001s)]
*  cautious. But in general, it's this newer group of Democrats who would begin changing the party. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1576.46s)]
*  Shane, the reality is that the next congressional primaries for Democrats that will reveal whether or not [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1583.54s)]
*  something like a Tea Party uncertainty is happening within the party, they're not for another year. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1589.6599999999999s)]
*  And a lot can happen between now and then. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1594.1399999999999s)]
*  And therefore, just to be transparent, it's impossible for us to know whether we're at the beginning of [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1596.34s)]
*  something really big happening in this party, just as it would have been really hard to predict that Obama's [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1601.3s)]
*  election in 2008 and what he did in 2009, 2010 was going to lead to the birth of the Tea Party. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1607.42s)]
*  Absolutely. But what we do see here is the possibility of an inflection point. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1613.14s)]
*  This spending fight is likely to be long forgotten in a sea of future spending fights and big changes that [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1620.74s)]
*  Donald Trump is making. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1628.3000000000002s)]
*  Right. But for Democrats who are already running or considering running in 2026, this does have the feeling [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1629.78s)]
*  of a potential moment where the party was galvanized to say, hey, the way the old guard of the party has been [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1638.1000000000001s)]
*  doing this, we don't want that anymore. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1644.42s)]
*  Yes, Chuck Schumer might have been painted into a losing corner, but we wanted the fight anyway. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1649.3400000000001s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1655.86s)]
*  Chuck Schumer might have made a decision that was strategic, that was protecting his party for worse [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1657.02s)]
*  outcomes in the short term or even the medium term. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1663.58s)]
*  But that action could have long term consequences for the way the Democratic Party behaves far into the [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1666.8999999999999s)]
*  future. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1672.5s)]
*  Well, Shane, thank you very much. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIY8I60HiJs&t=1676.82s)]
