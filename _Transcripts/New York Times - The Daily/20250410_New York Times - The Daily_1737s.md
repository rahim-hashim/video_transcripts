# A U-Turn on Tariffs
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bavaro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=4.48s)]
*  President Trump says that he is pausing some of the tariffs that took effect overnight. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=10.32s)]
*  He announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=14.24s)]
*  After promising that tariffs against dozens of countries were here to stay, no matter [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=18.76s)]
*  how much they hurt businesses or the stock market, President Trump has abruptly reversed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=24.04s)]
*  course. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  A universal 10% tariff is in place while country-specific deals come together and sector-specific tariffs [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  remain. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=38.2s)]
*  It looks like the U.S. has blings. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=39.2s)]
*  Except when it comes to China. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=41.2s)]
*  The president also saying that he will raise the tariff on Chinese imports now up to 125% [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  today. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=51.72s)]
*  Jonathan Swan on why the president changed his mind. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=52.88s)]
*  And David Pearson on why China won't back down. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=56.88s)]
*  It's Thursday, April 10th. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=67.04s)]
*  Hey Jonathan. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=71.12s)]
*  Thank you for coming in very last minute and joining us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=78.64s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=83.72s)]
*  So, the question here is very simple. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=84.72s)]
*  Why did Donald Trump reverse himself here and take the off-ramp from these tariffs that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=87.16s)]
*  none of us thought he was very likely to take? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=93.86s)]
*  What happened here? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=96.72s)]
*  Well, if you listen to the public explanations from his aides... [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=98.08s)]
*  This negotiation went exactly the way we had hoped it would go. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=102.16s)]
*  This was the plan all along. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=107.32s)]
*  As I told everyone a week ago, do not retaliate and you will be rewarded. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  The Treasury secretary, the press secretary. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=115.44s)]
*  Many of you in the media clearly missed the art of the deal. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  You clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  The genius out of the deal strategy to isolate China and negotiate with the rest of the world. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=124.96s)]
*  The entire world is calling the United States of America not China because they need our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=131.56s)]
*  markets, they need our consumers and they need this president in the Oval Office to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=136.04s)]
*  talk to them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=140.35999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  This was all pre-planned. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  Behind the scenes, what actually happened and we're still getting more detail now. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=145.88s)]
*  My colleagues, Maggie Haberman and myself and others on our team have been reporting this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=150.0s)]
*  out. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=154.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=155.0s)]
*  It's only five o'clock. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=156.0s)]
*  We haven't had all that much time to make sense of basically a three hour old pause. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=160.32s)]
*  But, based on the conversations I've had in the last two hours, I can say with confidence [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=161.32s)]
*  that this was a decision driven by fear of a full blown financial panic. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=165.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  In crisis. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  It is true that Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary and others in Trump's orbit have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  been for several days now trying to talk him towards a more tailored tariff strategy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  that would not punish allies as harshly as America's worst trade adversaries and one [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=188.28s)]
*  that would potentially isolate China while putting a freeze on other countries to negotiate, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=196.12s)]
*  which is where they ended up. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=202.96s)]
*  But as has become clear in conversations I've had in the last couple of hours, the entity [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=204.6s)]
*  that deserves most credit for today's decision is the bond markets and fear among Trump's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=209.3s)]
*  that this could spiral out into a full blown financial panic. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=215.84s)]
*  So just explain the meltdown, Jonathan, in the bond market. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=220.52s)]
*  Well, you've got the worst person you could possibly ask to explain the meltdown in the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=224.8s)]
*  bond market. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=229.4s)]
*  You actually need someone who knows what they're talking about. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=230.4s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  Jonathan, we figured this might be the case, that you are not the authority on the bond [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=233.04000000000002s)]
*  market and so in the grand tradition of phoning a friend and having Marshall McLuhan behind [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  the potted plant, we're going to bring on someone who is an authority on bonds to briefly [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=240.64s)]
*  explain what the heck just happened there. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=246.92s)]
*  I think that's very wise for your listeners. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=249.64s)]
*  Hello? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=252.64s)]
*  Hey, Peter Goodman. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=253.64s)]
*  Michael Barbar. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=256.64s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=258.52s)]
*  Good, good. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=261.52s)]
*  Also, hello to Jonathan Swan, who has just acknowledged what I would acknowledge in this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=262.52s)]
*  moment too, which is that the bond market is pretty hard to explain. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  So we decided to call you and ask you to just briefly explain what happened in the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=270.52s)]
*  bond market because as Jonathan just put it, that felt decisive in the Trump administration's [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=276.44s)]
*  decision to hit pause on the tariffs. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=282.08s)]
*  That terrified them, Jonathan just said. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  So what happened? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=288.12s)]
*  Why would it merit terror from this administration? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=293.24s)]
*  So there are not a lot of sure things in this world, but one of them is that in times of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=294.24s)]
*  people around the world buy the U.S. dollar and specifically they buy U.S. government [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=299.2s)]
*  bonds. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=305.08000000000004s)]
*  Because there's this built-in assumption that whatever happens, war, aliens invade, you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  know, whatever, the U.S. government's going to endure. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=315.12s)]
*  And that appears to have broken down, not fully, but at least in the margins, this idea [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=317.92s)]
*  that the U.S. is the ultimate safe haven is broken down. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=323.44s)]
*  And when people are less willing to buy U.S. government debt, U.S. government has to pay [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  a greater rate of return to persuade people to buy our debt. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=333.36s)]
*  They have to pay higher interest rates, basically. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=337.52000000000004s)]
*  And a lot of other interest rates are paid to the rates on U.S. government debt, mortgages, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=341.44s)]
*  credit cards. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  And so you've got both the message of the bond market freaking out, which is that people [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=352.68s)]
*  who trade money for a living worry that bad days are ahead. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=359.28s)]
*  And then you've got the direct consequences of jacking up borrowing rates, which is an [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  easy way to end up in a nasty recession. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  God, just to make sure I understand, traditionally you buy a bond, you basically loan the United [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=373.64s)]
*  States government some money. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=377.96s)]
*  You are 1000% sure that money is going to come back with a little extra. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=379.88s)]
*  All of a sudden, people are fearful that might not be the case. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=384.64s)]
*  The government might not be so dependable. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=389.2s)]
*  They start selling these bonds and it starts to mess up all other kinds of borrowing rates [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=390.59999999999997s)]
*  around the economy. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=397.48s)]
*  And that's how you suddenly get into a situation where this all starts to go really sideways. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=399.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, your mortgage goes up, well, you're going to spend less on other [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=406.28s)]
*  parts of the economy, which means you're depriving businesses of income. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=410.64s)]
*  Maybe you're not going to buy that house you were thinking about. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  And now housing prices don't go up as much and some developer doesn't make as much money [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=416.24s)]
*  as they hoped. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=421.08s)]
*  And construction companies get less business as a result. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=422.08s)]
*  This is how economic downturns happen. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=425.88s)]
*  One key trigger is when the cost of borrowing money goes up, and especially quickly, that [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  can be a real shock to the system. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=434.24s)]
*  Got it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=436.36s)]
*  And that shock is exactly what happened today in the bond market. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=437.36s)]
*  Okay, Peter, this is really helpful. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=440.64s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=443.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=444.64s)]
*  Okay, Jonathan, do you get it now? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=445.64s)]
*  I kind of got it before, but not in a way that was going to be very useful to your listeners. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=450.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm glad you got Peter on. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=455.48s)]
*  Well, perhaps you could have done it just as well. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=457.04s)]
*  We'll never know. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=458.92s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=459.92s)]
*  You made the right decision. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=460.92s)]
*  What else is factoring into the White House decision beyond the bond market? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=462.16s)]
*  When we had been talking to you a couple of days ago, there were all these CEOs knocking [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=465.92s)]
*  on the president's door and saying, this is not sustainable. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=470.42s)]
*  None of that mattered. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=476.8s)]
*  It was just the bond market suddenly going haywire or was it all kind of becoming one [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=477.8s)]
*  big collective untenable situation? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=482.64s)]
*  Well, I don't want to pretend omniscience here. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=486.08000000000004s)]
*  It's very hard to kind of get inside Trump's head. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=490.56s)]
*  As I said to you in the last time we talked, the only thing you could really go by is what [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=492.98s)]
*  he's saying privately and what he's saying publicly. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=497.52s)]
*  And the two things were pretty much the same, which was these tariffs are great. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=500.72s)]
*  They're bringing in money. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=504.76s)]
*  Everyone's coming and begging to me and kissing my ass. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=506.36s)]
*  But I think things pretty clearly started to shift Sunday night, Monday morning in the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=509.72s)]
*  direction of being open to negotiations. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=514.16s)]
*  My colleague, Maggie Haberman, has some reporting that Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=516.96s)]
*  flew with Trump to Washington from Palm Beach on Sunday night and had a really important [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=521.6s)]
*  conversation with him on the plane, steering him more in this direction. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=526.88s)]
*  J.D. Vance, actually the vice president, was supportive of this idea of being more structured [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=531.2800000000001s)]
*  with the tariffs, focusing more on China. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=536.6s)]
*  So these conversations were happening. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=538.6800000000001s)]
*  But when we last spoke, which was Monday, I didn't have any sense and neither, this is [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=540.6s)]
*  the more important part, neither did Trump's most senior advisors that he was going to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=546.28s)]
*  back off these tariffs. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=550.52s)]
*  Mr. Trade Representative, are you aware that the tariffs have been paused? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=552.6s)]
*  I am. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=558.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=559.16s)]
*  When were you made aware of that? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=560.16s)]
*  The U.S. Trade Representative, Jamison Greer, was on the Hill. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=561.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=563.6s)]
*  What are the details? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=564.6s)]
*  How long is the pause? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=565.6s)]
*  How many days? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=566.6s)]
*  How many weeks? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=567.6s)]
*  I understand it's 90 days. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=568.6s)]
*  I haven't spoken to the president since I've been in this year. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=570.04s)]
*  The Trade Representative hasn't spoken to the president of the United States. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=571.76s)]
*  He didn't know about it before it happened. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=576.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=579.08s)]
*  And that earned him some serious mockery from Democrats who said, who is in charge here? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=580.08s)]
*  Because if the U.S. Trade Representative is in front of Congress defending these tariffs [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=585.16s)]
*  while the tariffs are paused, it did not seem to the members of that congressional committee [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=588.36s)]
*  that there was any unified vision of what was happening. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=593.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=596.96s)]
*  This just goes to show how quickly this all came together and how much it was driven by [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=598.1600000000001s)]
*  pressure, external pressure and anxiety rather than something that was preordained, you know, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=601.96s)]
*  the plan all along. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=609.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, give me a break. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  So Jonathan, we're learning something, it seems pretty important about this president, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=611.84s)]
*  which is contrary to our belief that after the first term, he was no longer swayable [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=616.96s)]
*  by market forces when it came to something like tariffs, that if the markets went down, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=624.28s)]
*  even if perhaps the bond market started to go haywire, he was deeply committed to this [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=630.36s)]
*  vision of tariffs. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=634.92s)]
*  That was our thinking. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=636.0799999999999s)]
*  And the markets were not going to take him off that position. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=637.8s)]
*  And then... [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=643.8399999999999s)]
*  Can you walk us through what you're thinking about why you decided to put a 90-day pause? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=644.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=650.16s)]
*  They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  We hear something very different, including the president personally in front of the White [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=660.36s)]
*  House acknowledging that people were getting the yippies. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=663.76s)]
*  That was his word. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=667.36s)]
*  The bond market right now is beautiful. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=668.92s)]
*  But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  And so clearly this is the president conceding that he is at the mercy of the markets to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=675.4s)]
*  a degree. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=680.34s)]
*  For sure. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=681.34s)]
*  And what we did today was we located his pain threshold. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=682.8s)]
*  He actually withstood way more pain. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=686.9599999999999s)]
*  Ten trillion dollars in wealth wiped out. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=690.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=693.24s)]
*  This was not term one Trump until now. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=694.24s)]
*  It required genuine fear of some of his top officials that this really could spiral out [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=696.9599999999999s)]
*  of control. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=703.62s)]
*  And so he's bringing about a recession on his watch. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=704.62s)]
*  Trump has privately, certainly in the last two years, he's been talking about, I don't [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=707.66s)]
*  want to be Herbert Hoover. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=712.1s)]
*  I don't want, talks about 1929 a lot privately, this idea that some catastrophic Great Depression [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=713.1s)]
*  type event could happen on his watch. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=719.98s)]
*  He really fears that. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=721.86s)]
*  And up until now, what he had seen in the markets obviously did not lead him to the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=723.78s)]
*  conclusion that he could be Herbert Hoover. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=729.26s)]
*  I think the signals that they were seeing today tipped him over the edge. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=732.24s)]
*  I'm curious what it does to Trump's credibility going forward to have that pain threshold [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=737.12s)]
*  reached in such a short period of time, less than a week when it came to these tariffs. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=742.48s)]
*  And so if you're the rest of the world looking at whether Trump and his administration can [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=747.5600000000001s)]
*  stand by these difficult positions like tariffs that he said were a long term project to bring [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=752.9200000000001s)]
*  jobs back to the US, who's going to believe him the next time he wants to create leverage [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=760.92s)]
*  in one of these situations? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=765.92s)]
*  Well, I don't want to speculate because I haven't talked to any foreign leaders since [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=768.6s)]
*  the pause. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=772.28s)]
*  And I'd like to talk to a few before I give you any commentary on that. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=773.28s)]
*  But what I will say is even before this decision today, you had a crisis of credibility in [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=777.68s)]
*  which allies, foreign governments did not know whether they could trust the president's [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=785.2s)]
*  word, whether his negotiators actually spoke on his behalf. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=791.96s)]
*  I have spoken to a number of foreign officials who really struggle negotiating with this [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=796.88s)]
*  White House because they don't know if their interlocutors are going to have the rug pulled [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=800.84s)]
*  out from under them from the president any minute. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=805.0600000000001s)]
*  So Scott Besson, the Treasury Secretary talked today about more than 75 countries have reached [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=808.0400000000001s)]
*  out for negotiations. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=812.62s)]
*  Are they going to be, quote unquote, bespoke? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=814.0s)]
*  You know, each one is individual, blah, blah, blah. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=816.48s)]
*  Well, that's fine. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=819.2s)]
*  But I think that it's not going to be so easy to negotiate necessarily with all these different [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=821.04s)]
*  countries because they don't necessarily know that they can rely on the word of the United [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=825.98s)]
*  States after all of this turmoil, all of this rug pulling. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=831.84s)]
*  And I think that's actually going to be the real challenge. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=836.18s)]
*  Again, asking you to do something that perhaps is a little uncomfortable for you, which is [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=839.28s)]
*  to speculate on what happens next. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=843.24s)]
*  But is there any sense that in 90 days the president would ever restore these tariffs, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=845.4s)]
*  knowing the amount of trauma they inflicted on the U.S. and the global economy? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=851.28s)]
*  Or is the sense that they have every incentive to do deals and not bring these tariffs back [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=855.4s)]
*  across the world? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=863.4s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to make a speculation about what Trump might do, but I think the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=864.96s)]
*  markets already have. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=870.36s)]
*  I think the market reaction to this, as exuberant as it was, suggests that people think that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=871.92s)]
*  the idea of Trump launching a global trade war against allies and adversaries alike has [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=877.6s)]
*  passed. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=884.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=885.6s)]
*  And that this is more likely to be an America versus China trade war with a baseline tariff [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=886.6s)]
*  of 10%, which is much more tolerable for not just foreign governments, but the markets. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=893.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=899.16s)]
*  So, in a way, the state of play at this moment is that tariffs that were varied based on [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=900.16s)]
*  countries and in some cases extremely high have gone down to a much, much smaller universal [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=904.28s)]
*  tariff of 10%. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=910.26s)]
*  The rest have been paused. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  But not when it comes to China. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=914.3199999999999s)]
*  Those originally very high tariffs remain. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=917.76s)]
*  And in fact, through tit for tat and back and forth, they've gone up past 100% from [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=921.16s)]
*  the U.S. as of Wednesday. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  And so therefore we now have a trade war that has seemingly been narrowed down to China. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=929.6s)]
*  And I wonder how you think about that and how far we think the president is willing [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=935.4200000000001s)]
*  to take that particular face off. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  My sense is quite far and he won't want to be the one to back down first. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=945.78s)]
*  But he can't be happy about this, having to blink and having to put the pause on all of [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=950.16s)]
*  this. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  China will assume even more importance for him, quote unquote, winning that trade war. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=956.12s)]
*  And remember, Trump is not someone who views international trade as win-win, as cooperation, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=965.92s)]
*  coming to an agreement where both sides come out happy. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=973.76s)]
*  He sees it as zero sum with a clear winner and a clear loser. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=976.4s)]
*  And he will not want to be the first person to back down and, quote unquote, lose this [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  trade war against China. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=984.92s)]
*  So depending on what China does, I think is the real question about where this ends up, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=986.04s)]
*  because I don't see Trump wanting to back down first. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=992.32s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, thank you very much. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1001.32s)]
*  Thanks, Michael. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1004.6s)]
*  After the break, Rachel Abrams talks to our colleague David Pearson about how China and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1005.24s)]
*  its leader are likely to respond. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1016.36s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1022.72s)]
*  David, good morning. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1035.24s)]
*  I should say you are in Hong Kong, which is 12 hours ahead of us here in New York City. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1039.4s)]
*  And I do want to share that when this story about the new tariffs on China broke at around [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1044.08s)]
*  2 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, we here at The Daily were debating how early is too [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1049.32s)]
*  early to call you and wake you up, 5 a.m., maybe 6 a.m. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1055.56s)]
*  But being the generous colleagues that we are, we decided to let you sleep in. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1060.24s)]
*  But nevertheless, it's early. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1063.0s)]
*  And thank you so much for being here with us. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1064.4s)]
*  I'm so happy to be here. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1066.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1067.32s)]
*  So while you were sleeping, Trump announced a pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1068.48s)]
*  everywhere except for China. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1074.32s)]
*  And you cover China for The New York Times. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1076.6s)]
*  You've been following the standoff between the United States and China very closely. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1078.92s)]
*  Just to start off, were you surprised by the news when you woke up? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1083.12s)]
*  So I was surprised that the tariffs were paused on most of the world. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1087.88s)]
*  But I was not surprised that the tariffs were actually increased on China because we've [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1092.36s)]
*  seen such a ratcheting up of this trade war between these two countries in the last week [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1097.8s)]
*  or so. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1102.84s)]
*  And China is the only country that has decided to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1103.84s)]
*  When the Trump administration slapped terrorists on them last week, China returned the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1109.32s)]
*  volley with the same tariff on the United States. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1115.6s)]
*  And then when Trump increased it again, China responded with the exact same levy. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1119.92s)]
*  And now here we are today with a whopping 125 percent tariff on Chinese goods. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1126.84s)]
*  And now we're waiting for China's response to that. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1136.56s)]
*  China will now be subjected to sort of a staggering figure, 125 percent tariff. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1136.96s)]
*  That number has just been going up and up and up. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  What is the state of play in this trade war at the moment? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1146.4s)]
*  Like, what is China's appetite for negotiating right now? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1149.92s)]
*  I think China wants this trade war to end. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1154.3200000000002s)]
*  Its economy has been struggling for a few years now because of a property crisis. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1157.5600000000002s)]
*  They've built too many houses and there aren't enough buyers right now. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1162.2s)]
*  And so there's been a problem with deflation, with rising debt. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1167.76s)]
*  And the only thing that's been driving growth in the economy is manufacturing and exports. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  And the biggest single market for China is the United States. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1178.72s)]
*  About 15 percent of its exports go to the United States. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1183.44s)]
*  Now that's a smaller share than it was a few years ago, but it's still a massive part of [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1187.92s)]
*  China's business model. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  So basically, because China has all of their eggs in this export basket, so to speak, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1194.88s)]
*  they're extremely vulnerable if all of those exports suddenly become much more expensive to export. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1200.36s)]
*  Exactly. They're going to have to find new markets and there just isn't enough out there to absorb [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1207.3999999999999s)]
*  all these things that China usually sells to the United States. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1213.28s)]
*  If a trade war is going to be so painful for China, potentially, why wouldn't they just be [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1217.36s)]
*  motivated to cut some kind of a deal? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1222.92s)]
*  Like, even if it's a deal that is really just a victory and name only for President Trump, why [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1225.08s)]
*  would they not be motivated to give that to him? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1229.96s)]
*  National pride and political legitimacy is on the line for China's leader, Xi Jinping. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1232.48s)]
*  He is not going to come to the negotiation table under duress. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1238.28s)]
*  He wants China to be treated like an equal to the United States. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1241.92s)]
*  He has built up an image of himself as a strong man in China, someone who is responsible for [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1246.04s)]
*  rejuvenating China's sort of greatness. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1252.1200000000001s)]
*  And so he cannot afford to look weak at all. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1254.8400000000001s)]
*  The legitimacy of his rule, of the Communist Party, rests on him being able to stand up to the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1258.72s)]
*  United States. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1265.36s)]
*  So it really feels like you have two leaders of two of the world's largest economic powers who [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1267.36s)]
*  both feel like they need to project power. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1274.1200000000001s)]
*  They cannot back down. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1276.76s)]
*  They cannot capitulate. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1278.2s)]
*  Any deal that they strike would need to save face. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1279.8s)]
*  And all of that seems like sort of a bad combination from the standpoint of trying to deescalate [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1282.6s)]
*  and strike some kind of a deal that's productive for both sides. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1287.88s)]
*  So I'm curious, David, what could they do here? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  So China, of course, still has other levers that it can pull to inflict some pain on the United [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1295.0400000000002s)]
*  States. There are still many big American companies that are invested in the Chinese [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1301.16s)]
*  market. You know, it's something that American businesses have drooled over for decades. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1307.76s)]
*  And they can go after those companies. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1313.52s)]
*  It can also go after Hollywood. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1316.3600000000001s)]
*  It could block more films coming into China. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1317.92s)]
*  It could then also target some of the states that produce agricultural commodities that China [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1320.68s)]
*  imports from the United States. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1327.48s)]
*  Those are generally states that voted heavily for Donald Trump. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1329.0400000000002s)]
*  It could also decide not to allow a sale of TikTok, which has been a front burner issue for [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1333.7600000000002s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1340.0800000000002s)]
*  Lastly, and this is the most risky of the options, it could also devalue its currency to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1341.6799999999998s)]
*  make its exports more competitive in the global marketplace. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1348.24s)]
*  The problem with that, though, is it would raise tensions with other countries that are [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1353.1599999999999s)]
*  worried about Chinese overcapacity and having too many Chinese cheap goods flood their [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1360.0s)]
*  country. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1364.4399999999998s)]
*  If both sides don't reach a deal and this whole thing does keep ratcheting up and escalating [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1365.88s)]
*  in the ways that we've already been seeing, what does that look like, just practically [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1371.1200000000001s)]
*  speaking, for both China and the United States? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1375.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, from the United States, American consumers are just going to see prices go up. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1378.48s)]
*  They're going to order things from Amazon and be shocked by what they're paying for [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1384.72s)]
*  whatever you're ordering from China, which is a lot of things. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1389.2800000000002s)]
*  From the Chinese side, this is going to make a bad economic situation even worse. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1392.72s)]
*  That means higher unemployment. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1399.16s)]
*  That means factories going idle. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1401.16s)]
*  That means goods that are just sitting in warehouses and not being able to offload it [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1403.68s)]
*  on to other countries. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1410.56s)]
*  But ironically, in the long run, this could actually help China. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1413.48s)]
*  It could actually accelerate the one thing they really, really need, which is to [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1420.68s)]
*  reform their economy away from exports. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1426.8400000000001s)]
*  They can't be this one trick pony. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1430.2s)]
*  They have to find a way to get more people in China to consume things kind of like [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1432.48s)]
*  Americans so that their economy is on a more sustainable footing. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1438.88s)]
*  And the problem is the government knows this, but to make that reform requires [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1444.0s)]
*  painful changes that have been really slow and hard to make so far. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1449.76s)]
*  This is also interesting because it is so similar to the arguments that Trump has [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1456.08s)]
*  been making. Like both of these leaders feel like what's happening now could be [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1459.9599999999998s)]
*  better for each of their countries in the long term after some short term pain, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1465.08s)]
*  short term pain, long term gain. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1471.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1473.76s)]
*  It's that economists have been telling China that it needs to reform its economy [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1474.4399999999998s)]
*  for years, whereas economists in the United States are very skeptical about [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1479.0s)]
*  President Trump's plan and how it would bring manufacturing back to the United [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1485.04s)]
*  States. In the meantime, China would definitely prefer status quo because then [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1488.8799999999999s)]
*  it could work on reforming its economy without facing the pressure of a trade [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1495.7199999999998s)]
*  war. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1499.9199999999998s)]
*  David, you've been watching this dynamic between China and the United States for [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1501.12s)]
*  years. And what we've seen in the last few weeks, and obviously in the last 24 [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1504.6799999999998s)]
*  hours, represents just a massive disruption to that relationship. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1509.56s)]
*  And I'm just curious what you think is the most fundamental shift that all of [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1513.8s)]
*  this represents. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1518.52s)]
*  So right now we're still in the brinksmanship phase, I think, of the trade [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1521.48s)]
*  war. There's still some room where they're jockeying for some sort of [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1525.8799999999999s)]
*  acceptable solution where both leaders save face. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1530.72s)]
*  But what this disruption has reminded us is that there's a chance these two [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1535.76s)]
*  largest economies in the world could actually divorce what we call the [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1543.3999999999999s)]
*  coupling. And if that actually happens, we'll speak of it as a sort of before [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1547.9199999999998s)]
*  and after times. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1554.32s)]
*  To be sure, we're not there yet, but we're closer than ever before. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1559.6399999999999s)]
*  And you have to think about the US-China relationship for the last five decades. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1565.84s)]
*  The glue has been business. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1570.84s)]
*  It is the bedrock of almost 50 years of bilateral relations. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1573.12s)]
*  You take that glue away, then everything is on the table now. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1578.6399999999999s)]
*  The two most powerful countries can't get together and talk about all the other [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1585.24s)]
*  problems facing the world today, like climate change, like pandemics, like [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1590.3999999999999s)]
*  financial crises. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1595.92s)]
*  But it also means they can't get together and talk about things they disagree on [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1598.16s)]
*  because they'll have less reason to, things like the fate of Taiwan, fentanyl [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1602.72s)]
*  and human rights. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1608.12s)]
*  And if China and the US aren't talking, if they're not engaging on these big [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1610.2s)]
*  issues, then we're suddenly plunged into a far more dangerous world. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1614.4s)]

*  Who have blocked President Trump's agenda? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1669.24s)]
*  Trump and his allies have been frustrated by how frequently district court judges [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1672.16s)]
*  have struck down his executive orders on issues ranging from deportations to mass [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1677.1200000000001s)]
*  firings at federal agencies. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1683.04s)]
*  But the bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate where Democrats and moderate [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1685.72s)]
*  Republicans are expected to oppose it. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7ODfNH-5t4&t=1691.04s)]
