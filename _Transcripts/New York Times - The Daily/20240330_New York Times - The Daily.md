# From Serial: Season 4 - Guant√°namo
**New York Times Podcasts:** [March 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNiouqosyig)
*  Hey everyone, it's Sabrina.
*  As you know, sometimes on the weekends, we here at The Daily bring you episodes of other
*  shows made by our colleagues at New York Times Audio.
*  This weekend, we've got the first episode of Serial's new season, season four.
*  This time, the Serial team's telling a story that maybe hasn't been on your mind recently,
*  but as they'll show, it's one of the most important, fascinating, and complicated criminal
*  justice stories in our country.
*  And that's Guantanamo Bay.
*  So here they are with that first new episode.
*  And for all the rest, search Serial wherever you listen to podcasts or in our New York
*  Times Audio app.
*  Happy listening.
*  Over here at Serial, we love criminal justice stories.
*  Guantanamo is the most astonishing one we've ever seen.
*  Guantanamo is a prison and a court that we made from scratch right after September 11th.
*  We were at war in Afghanistan fighting Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
*  And pretty soon, we'd captured thousands of men.
*  Our makeshift holding cells in Afghanistan couldn't handle them all.
*  We needed a safe place to keep them, away from the chaos, so we could sort them out.
*  And the place we chose was Guantanamo Bay, 8,000 miles away from Afghanistan, in Cuba.
*  We already had a sleepy naval base there.
*  We've had it since 1903.
*  There's plenty of room, and this part was crucial.
*  The Bush administration figured because the base was in Cuba, on foreign soil, the prisoners
*  we delivered there wouldn't have access to U.S. courts.
*  That was the innovation.
*  We wanted leeway to hold these guys for however long we wanted.
*  And mostly, we wanted to interrogate them, however we wanted, to find out what they knew,
*  especially about Al-Qaeda, because we didn't know a ton about Al-Qaeda back then.
*  And we were petrified they were about to blindside us again.
*  So that was the idea.
*  Guantanamo wouldn't be a traditional POW camp.
*  It'd be a new thing, with new rules.
*  The problem, well there were many, many problems.
*  But the problem that dogged Guantanamo the whole time, and which became apparent pretty
*  quickly, was that these weren't the guys we thought they were.
*  All told, 780 Muslim men and some boys were held at Guantanamo, and even the ones who
*  were Taliban or Al-Qaeda.
*  They were overwhelmingly low-level, like foot soldiers.
*  Other prisoners, we never figured out exactly who they were or if they posed a threat to us.
*  Our intel wasn't so hot.
*  We'd shipped all these prisoners to Guantanamo without a solid plan for letting them back out.
*  Many people sat there for two, three, five years, and some 12 years, 14 years, 16 years.
*  We didn't know what to do with them.
*  30 men are still held at Guantanamo.
*  And the cost?
*  The last time someone tallied it up, $13 million a year, per prisoner.
*  Guantanamo's probably the most expensive lockup in the world.
*  Astonishing, no?
*  Dana Chivas and I, Dana's worked on previous seasons of Serial.
*  She's going to be my co-host this season.
*  Dana and I have been trying to do a story about Guantanamo for years, almost a decade.
*  Our first attempt was in 2015.
*  Sarah and I had flown down to Guantanamo, or Gitmo as it's often called, for the official
*  media tour, the only way we could see the prison.
*  The experience was strange, almost as soon as we arrived.
*  We were picked up at the airport by two soldiers from Public Affairs.
*  Would any of you guys like to stop at the small little mini-mart real quick on this
*  side?
*  If you want a snack or something, they also have souvenirs there, but you'll have another
*  chance to get more souvenirs on the other side.
*  Guantanamo has three gift shops.
*  Recently, the gift shops did a collaboration with Disney, so you could bring home a t-shirt
*  that says, Guantanamo Bay, with a Minnie Mouse on it.
*  Or one with palm trees that says, it don't Gitmo better than this.
*  For the mindful, there was a coffee mug with a simple mantra.
*  Be here now, Guantanamo Bay.
*  We passed up the souvenir offer on day one.
*  Maybe you caught Sarah's hesitation in the tape.
*  Because how inappropriate.
*  But by day three, there we were, shelling out cash for Fidel Castro bobbleheads to bring
*  to our loved ones back home.
*  To be at Guantanamo is to be worn down into a, if you can't beat them, join them posture.
*  It's a company town.
*  The company is the US military.
*  Everything in the town belongs to the US military.
*  The car wash, the high school, the bowling alley, the ground zero paintball range.
*  And of course, the story of Guantanamo that they tell you at Guantanamo about what they're
*  doing.
*  That also belongs to the military.
*  Our mission today is to provide safe, humane, legal and transparent custody of the detainees
*  here.
*  They didn't talk about the history of the prison, why it's here, what went on here,
*  who's still being held here.
*  They talked about the mission.
*  And they kept it tight.
*  From the camp commander all the way down the chain.
*  Our public affairs escorts, a medical officer, a guard.
*  Safe legal transparent care.
*  Safe legal humane and transparent.
*  We're leaving transparent care and custody of the detainees.
*  Care and custody of the detainees.
*  Providing compassionate care for these detainees.
*  Transparent care and custody and control.
*  The UN has said the treatment of the detainees at Guantanamo is quote, cruel and human and
*  degrading and that their detention and past torture are violations of international law.
*  But at the prison itself, what we heard from our military tour guides was about how well
*  cared for the detainees were.
*  They can give their own clippers, toothpaste, soap.
*  They also get some snack type items based on their compliance.
*  It's not that anyone was unprofessional or impolite with us.
*  The soldiers we spent the most time with, the public affairs escorts, were considerate
*  hosts picking us up a little after 6 a.m. engaging in small talk.
*  Sarah and I spent a lot of time ooing and awing the sights they pointed out.
*  Look at the color of that water.
*  Yeah, it's amazing.
*  Commenting on the weather.
*  It's really, really, really hot.
*  It's Afghanistan hotter, I'm sure, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Volumes hotter?
*  Well, yes, volumes hotter.
*  While behind us sat two prisons, housing 122 men.
*  The vast majority of whom had been there for more than a decade without charge.
*  This is beautiful.
*  This is so pretty.
*  It's like a garden.
*  My tolerance for all this polite chitchat wore thin.
*  Standing on a cliff above the sparkling sea, next to a small building where the adolescent
*  prisoners were once held, I had a tiny meltdown.
*  I'm hitting the part of the day where the fucked upness has just gone to my head.
*  What'd you say?
*  I think I'm hitting the part of the day where the heat and the fucked upness of everything
*  is just taking out my sensibility.
*  What do you mean?
*  I don't know, I just feel loopy from all of it.
*  Oh, you do.
*  It's exhausting because you're like pretending.
*  Everything is pretend.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  We're in a play and we're playing our part.
*  It's the pretending.
*  Everyone's doing their part.
*  It's the pretending that's making me lose it right now.
*  Recently, I looked back at my notes from that time.
*  I'd written, went to some lookout area.
*  I pretended to give a crap about the view.
*  You could see naval thingies in the water, used to tie up battleships in the bay.
*  It was a nice view, for sure.
*  Lots of hills, some green swampy mangrove looking things out on the bay.
*  And then, it really is like theater.
*  You're pretending to report, or else you're pretending to report the story they're telling
*  you.
*  And they're pretending to believe that the story you're doing is the one you've told
*  them you're doing.
*  You're pretending to believe all the bullshit they have to tell you.
*  And they're pretending that they're believing that you're believing it.
*  And everyone knows the only information you want is stuff they either don't know or couldn't
*  or wouldn't talk about, even if they did know.
*  Everyone acts chummy and yucks it up, including us.
*  What we wanted to know is what the people working at Guantanamo thought about Guantanamo,
*  how they saw their jobs.
*  They were part of something extraordinary.
*  So I was asking pretty much everyone I met what they thought about the detainees and
*  their status, sincerely asking, does this place feel like it's winding down?
*  A lot of the prisoners have been cleared to leave.
*  They aren't even supposed to be here anymore.
*  How do you feel about that?
*  And they look a little stricken.
*  They said things like, I don't know, I don't have any personal feelings, you know, toward
*  these people.
*  Or this line of questioning makes me completely nervous.
*  One guy told me it was unfair of me even to ask.
*  We started to give up on the idea we could have a normal conversation with anyone.
*  Lucky for us, one of our public affairs escorts was a delightful ray of sunshine in the form
*  of Army Specialist Raul Sanchez.
*  Raul was cheerful and chatty.
*  He seemed looser than the other escorts.
*  We're like a Disneyland employee.
*  That was a joke.
*  Definitely a joke.
*  It's nothing like Disneyland.
*  They have no churros here.
*  Within an hour of meeting him, we'd learn Raul was from Arizona, newly married, he was
*  leading a group for LGBT service members, co-hosting a show over at the radio station,
*  and he seemed genuinely interested in the history of Guantanamo.
*  So after a couple of days, I pitched my question to Raul.
*  Raul, I said, some of these guys have been cleared to leave for four or five years now,
*  and yet all around us, there's this massive apparatus to sustain their confinement.
*  Do you ever struggle with that idea?
*  I never struggle with the idea because I feel that we have pushed our limits so far to make
*  such a humane environment for them that every day we're trying to seek new ways to try to
*  make this place a better environment, to make it a better living situation.
*  That's oh my gosh, poor baby Raul.
*  That is present day Raul Sanchez, years after Sarah and I met him at Guantanamo.
*  I played him that same tape you just heard of him answering Sarah's question about the detainees.
*  He told me he remembered that conversation.
*  Oh my gosh, because she caught me.
*  That question caught me.
*  That was in a moment where I was realizing things and she caught me, which is why I don't sound as
*  quickly eloquent as I usually do.
*  Yeah, you didn't sound as canned.
*  No, I didn't have a canned answer because I was agreeing that they should just leave.
*  In that moment, I felt like, at least I feel right now in my heart, what I want in that moment was
*  just for you to take me back home with you guys and take me off the island.
*  Yeah, I felt trapped.
*  I felt trapped because I couldn't say anything.
*  I couldn't know.
*  I was now in that moment.
*  I was now lying.
*  Raul, of course, couldn't tell us any of this back then.
*  He was still on the job.
*  That's why we never did a story in 2015.
*  We couldn't get anyone to open up to us.
*  But even as Guantanamo faded as a topic of national discussion, we kept thinking about it,
*  wondering what was going on down there.
*  We figured there has got to be a way to do this story.
*  We even tried writing a TV show about it, a fictionalized version of Guantanamo, which,
*  humbling.
*  But while we were researching it, we had all of these fascinating off-the-record conversations with
*  former personnel and former detainees.
*  And so we started to wonder, maybe enough time has passed.
*  Maybe enough time has passed.
*  Enough people are back in civilian life.
*  Maybe they'd be willing to put some of those stories on the record.
*  So we tried again, contacted guards, interrogators, commanders, lawyers, chaplains, translators,
*  also former prisoners, more than 100 people.
*  And a remarkable number of them said, OK, I'm ready.
*  Here's what happened.
*  There's been great journalism about the legal maneuvering to justify Guantanamo and about the
*  detainee abuse, about the politics and policy.
*  But what we were after were the insider stories, a history of Guantanamo you could only get from
*  the regular people who went through it, the people caught inside a justice system that at its core
*  was made up.
*  What were they thinking?
*  If they could speak as themselves, for themselves, what would they say now that they couldn't say
*  then?
*  A lot, as it turns out.
*  From serial productions and The New York Times, this is season four of Serial, Guantanamo,
*  one prison camp told week by week.
*  I'm Sarah Koenig.
*  And I'm Dana Chivas.
*  Before we get back to Raul, we just want you to hear what Guantanamo is like, how it feels to live
*  there and work there and be imprisoned there from a bunch of people we've talked to.
*  It's the backdrop to all the other stories this season.
*  For example, maybe you have an idea in your head of what it's like to work at Guantanamo.
*  Put that aside for a second.
*  I mean, I love Gitmo.
*  Like, it's la-la land.
*  Jake Meyer was 25 when he arrived at Guantanamo to work in military intelligence.
*  You know, you're on 42 square miles.
*  You've got like five great beaches.
*  You know, it's always summer.
*  You don't have much to worry about.
*  You know, like, there weren't any worries.
*  You know, I didn't pay any taxes.
*  I didn't pay any rent.
*  You know, if you wanted to go scuba diving after work, I mean, you could be at the beach geared up and in the water in 20 minutes.
*  Guantanamo, for years, was portrayed as a key component in the war against terrorism.
*  But it also happens to be on a Caribbean naval base, stocked with booze.
*  I partied my ass off in Gitmo.
*  Everybody's in good shape.
*  Everybody's looking good.
*  Everyone's tan and hot.
*  Everyone's drinking and young.
*  Massive amount of drinking.
*  Massive amount of partying.
*  I mean, just everyone was getting drunk and getting laid.
*  And then the Puerto Rican National Guard.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  They had the best beach parties.
*  Thousands of young, fit soldiers and sailors.
*  For some of them, it's their first time away from home.
*  Guantanamo is where they've landed to come of age.
*  I talked to one guy, Patrick, who was on the prison's quick reaction force.
*  It's kind of like a SWAT team.
*  He turned 21 at Guantanamo.
*  He started his deployment trying to hit on women in bars, but ended up falling in love with another man, a sailor.
*  They had to sneak around.
*  What would you do together?
*  What types of activities would you do?
*  Or like, where would you go to?
*  Lots of sex.
*  Okay.
*  I just, you asked and I felt the need to ask in that way.
*  I asked the question and I heard myself asking.
*  Sexual activities.
*  Activities of sexual nature.
*  Sexual activities.
*  Okay.
*  Where?
*  Never mind.
*  So it felt very college-like without it being, obviously the next day wasn't classes.
*  It was Gitmo.
*  Remember, the original purpose of Guantanamo was to get fighters off the battlefield, out of the way, to a place where we could question them.
*  Guantanamo was a hastily built Intel factory.
*  Chaos.
*  Simply put, it was chaotic.
*  Well-meaning chaos, but chaos nonetheless.
*  That's Paul Rester.
*  He oversaw the military's Intel shop at Guantanamo in the early days.
*  When he first got there, Guantanamo was already crawling with people from three and four letter agencies.
*  CIA, FBI, DIA, NCIS.
*  Some were seasoned Al Qaeda investigators.
*  Others were fresh out of Army Intel School.
*  All were competing for access to the detainees.
*  To streamline the scheduling, they teamed up.
*  Three interrogators plus an interpreter.
*  So that's four people trying to interrogate a single detainee.
*  At the same time.
*  They're all sitting in a room together.
*  At the same time.
*  And oh, by the way, the only person in the room that's got any area studies knowledge of what they're talking about is the detainee.
*  I tried to explain everything I can.
*  Omar Dehais, a former detainee, was picked up in Pakistan.
*  And tried to persuade them that we're not the people they're looking for.
*  For him and for a lot of other detainees who didn't know much or anything at all about Al Qaeda, the interrogations were maddening.
*  The same questions over and over again for months, sometimes years.
*  They'd say, I've already answered that.
*  Go back to the file.
*  Or they'd stop speaking at all.
*  The American strategy could be mystifying.
*  Another guy, Murat Khranas, he was 19 when he was taken to Guantanamo.
*  He said he had this one interrogator who kept talking about the time he spent in Germany, where Murat's from.
*  He told me a lot of stories about his life.
*  And it was really boring.
*  But he taught me lots of stuff from his hashish, using hashish and stuff like that with young German parties and a lot of crazy stuff.
*  But you just did you say anything?
*  Did you just sit there and listen to it?
*  Yeah, I couldn't go away.
*  I had shackles on the ground.
*  I was locked to the ground.
*  I couldn't stand up.
*  In the beginning, the detainees didn't have a choice about the interrogations.
*  They were forced to go.
*  That's what made Guantanamo, Guantanamo.
*  To do what we wanted to do there, we ended up breaking international law, sidestepping the Geneva Conventions, which give certain protections to prisoners of war.
*  Instead, the government argued that the men we'd captured weren't prisoners of war.
*  They were something else.
*  They called them unlawful enemy combatants.
*  And according to this line of thinking, unlawful enemy combatants were not protected by the Geneva Conventions, which meant we could play by a different set of rules.
*  We could scream at them for hours, leave them shackled to the floor.
*  One time they told me my family, my mother and father, they died in a car accident.
*  They told me a lot of things.
*  That's awful.
*  They told me all my family, my brothers and mother and father, sit in the car and they had the accident.
*  But he told me he can't tell me any details and he's not allowed to talk with me about it.
*  So he just told me that very short and said, I can't tell you this.
*  Was this an interrogator who said this?
*  It was an interrogator, yeah.
*  I didn't know if I should believe him or not.
*  I didn't know.
*  Marat didn't learn his family was alive until years later, when his lawyer gave him a letter in his mother's handwriting.
*  Unlike normal American prisons, there weren't huge divisions among the inmates.
*  There were from all over the world, Afghanistan, but also Arabs from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Libya and Morocco, Kuwait, Tunisia, Sudan.
*  There were a few Europeans, two Australians.
*  Those guys tended to be released first.
*  They spoke different languages, which was a barrier in the beginning, but then they started learning each other's languages, including English.
*  There were Muslims.
*  They'd all been grabbed in the same conflict.
*  Omar Degay said they knew who was who, who was Al-Qaeda.
*  Of course, we knew who was Qaeda.
*  They were obvious because they spoke the way they spoke, how they communicate, even inside they had a different system.
*  By and large, everyone got along.
*  The abiding antagonism of the cell blocks was between the prisoners and the guards.
*  Often the guards would come in hot, hostile or scared.
*  They'd been told, like the rest of us back home, that these were the guys.
*  These are the men who attacked us on 9-11.
*  But after a while, some of them would start to doubt.
*  A former guard who worked in the blocks in the early years, he said by the end of his tour, he could differentiate among the detainees.
*  He was like, wait a minute.
*  This guy right here, yeah, he's probably, you know, probably legit, a horrible person that has either killed or caused people to be killed.
*  This guy over here doesn't know shit.
*  He just sits in his cell and cries and wants to go home.
*  After nine months or a year, the guard unit would rotate out and the cycle would start over.
*  The prisoners had different strategies for getting through.
*  A former detainee from Yemen who goes by Danny, he spent 14 years at Guantanamo.
*  I'm very optimistic there.
*  I was like, I always like looking at the sunlight and bright side and try to make from lemon juice and everything.
*  But it was so hard, so harsh, so mean.
*  If you protested or provoked, you risked all manner of physical abuse, including being trampled by a team of guards in riot gear.
*  Some detainees, Omar, for instance, fought back.
*  Omar figured, I'm going to get my ass kicked regardless, so I might as well make their lives harder.
*  He remembered after one particularly brutal confrontation.
*  Omar had a bad eye and he said a guard had gouged it.
*  And afterwards, they put him in a new cell where he could see his reflection.
*  Omar said he hadn't seen himself in a long, long time.
*  They had like an iron mirror. It wasn't a mirror, it was like a round thing on the wall.
*  And it was the first time I saw my face and I saw how my hair went like completely white, my chest was white.
*  My eye was like a shock to see. My eye was completely white. It's like shocking.
*  What were you most scared of in Guantanamo when you were there?
*  Most scared of? I don't know, maybe the...
*  We don't know what's going to happen. It's like you've been there for years.
*  And there's no...
*  No...
*  No foreseeable outcome.
*  There's no like how long am I going to stay in this prison?
*  I don't know, it's crazy. There wasn't a logical system how people are released and why.
*  And it's mostly nothing to do with the law, nothing to do with what went on in interrogation.
*  It's more to do with other politics outside the prison.
*  Guantanamo, the prison, wasn't built to last and nobody wanted it to last.
*  But nobody could manage to shut it down. Even President Bush, whose administration started Guantanamo,
*  he talked about closing it less than five years after it opened. Didn't happen.
*  Next came President Obama in 2009. He was going to close Guantanamo within a year.
*  Congress blocked that plan. Guantanamo was a beast no politician wanted to touch.
*  And the military couldn't empty it out either. We'd hoped to put a bunch of people on trial for war crimes,
*  but most of them we couldn't even charge, much less convict.
*  The evidence we had was too problematic, or we'd abused them too badly, or they were too small fry, not worth the effort.
*  We tried other ways to sort them, to determine which detainees posed a threat and which ones didn't.
*  But the people who did get cleared for release or transfer, a bunch of them, they still couldn't leave.
*  We had nowhere to send them. Couldn't send them home. We considered their governments too unstable.
*  Couldn't find another country to take them, refused to take them in ourselves.
*  A decade in and we were all stuck. And so began the languishing of Guantanamo.
*  Jake Meyer, the Intel analyst, he first got to Guantanamo in 2005.
*  The op tempo was high, everything was moving. You were a part of something big.
*  So you're caught up in the momentum, you're caught up in this constant Intel collection, as fast as you could get it.
*  Six years later, he came back.
*  Totally different story.
*  By then, 2012, the Intel mission, Guantanamo's primary mission, was pretty much done.
*  There were about 170 prisoners left. We'd gotten whatever we could from them.
*  The beehive energy of the place had dissipated.
*  You know, and there's a lot less people there. It's like a ghost town.
*  So, you know, the party moved on, I guess. And like everybody was kind of just like, what is going on now?
*  There's this feeling of everybody's just like, why are we still here?
*  The majority of prisoners were living communally in a new modern prison by this point.
*  They had access to movies, books, CD players.
*  They did art projects, made fantastical things out of cardboard.
*  They could finagle special items from the next, the big store on the base.
*  Interrogations were optional, and one former detainee told me, kind of pleasant.
*  But the perks didn't obliterate the facts.
*  President Obama's second term had begun, and Guantanamo stunk of permanence.
*  In early 2013, the detainees began a hunger strike, which grew and grew, attracting attention all over the world.
*  The hunger striker's message was the same as ever.
*  Either charge me with a crime or let me go.
*  And that's pretty much how things were when Sarah and I got to Guantanamo in 2015 and met Raoul.
*  The prison was maybe closing, maybe not closing.
*  And there were 122 men still there, with no idea of when or if they would ever leave.
*  So when I called Raoul years later, what I wanted to know was,
*  what did people like him, whose job it was to tell the official story of Guantanamo,
*  what did they really think about working there?
*  What was the unofficial story?
*  Of course, Raoul can't speak for the thousands of people who have worked there over the last 22 years.
*  But he did have a story to tell me, about why he was so desperate to leave Guantanamo
*  and what happened to him after.
*  By the time Sarah and I met him, Raoul had been in the Army for eight years already.
*  Before Guantanamo Bay, the military was my entire world.
*  I was talking about it every single day, every day.
*  I loved it. I took advantage of the military.
*  The military did not take advantage of me.
*  Raoul told me when he was graduating from high school, he needed some direction.
*  The military gave him that, and he got to do incredible things.
*  They sent him to Hawaii, paid for him to go to culinary school.
*  He got a $20,000 bonus when he enlisted in 2007.
*  Before Guantanamo, he deployed to Kosovo, into Afghanistan,
*  which surprisingly, he loved Afghanistan, lost his virginity at Bagram.
*  I became super gay there.
*  I would get my hair dyed black, I would get my eyebrows waxed,
*  because on the German side, they had a Russian-ran barber salon.
*  And so we would go in there and get facials, and it was crazy.
*  After Afghanistan, Raoul's next deployment was to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
*  the Pearl of the Antilles, which it says on the signs at Guantanamo,
*  the Pearl of the Antilles.
*  Raoul had never been to the Caribbean before.
*  Raoul's job was to escort reporters like Sarah and me around the base and into the prison.
*  Like most of the public affairs staff, and most of the staff at Guantanamo, actually,
*  Raoul didn't know much about the detainees.
*  But he was excited to tell reporters about all the good the military was doing for the prisoners.
*  I was so excited for you to come out there, for Fox News, for BBC, for Al Jazeera News to come,
*  so I can share the message of what we had to do as a military,
*  and that we were going over and above as if we were some, you know, salvation army,
*  and that we are there to keep them safe and to send them back to be with their family.
*  And that's what we're doing. We are humanitarians here.
*  That was my belief. That is what we were fed to be told.
*  That is how we talked about it. That is what we believed.
*  But the job was really stressful. And not just for the public affairs staff.
*  A lot of people told us this.
*  The flip side of the drinking culture was an intense anxiety, a fear of getting in trouble.
*  It was like they were under the world's microscope.
*  Sometimes the detainees would tattle on the guards.
*  Sometimes their own leadership would go after them.
*  Slip-ups, mistakes, and boneheaded decisions that would normally be handled with a slap on the wrist
*  could wind up in Article 15 proceedings at Gitmo.
*  Raul told me he preferred the fear and anxiety of Afghanistan.
*  At least it was fleeting. At Guantanamo...
*  You're like on edge the entire day. You can't really think. You can't be productive.
*  And that's what was happening there.
*  The public affairs staff especially were in a tricky position.
*  Caught between reporters who were notoriously impatient with government public affairs types
*  and their own commanding officers who were watching their every move
*  to make sure they didn't say too much or the wrong thing.
*  So they kept to the safe harbors of their talking points.
*  Present-day Raul demonstrated for me.
*  For instance, if a reporter had asked,
*  what percentage of prisoners are hunger-striking right now?
*  A question Sarah did ask.
*  Raul might have said, thank you so much for that question.
*  Our enteral feedings are overseen by our nursing staff.
*  And making sure that they're really staying safe, you know,
*  because our biggest takeaway and our biggest mission here at Guantanamo Bay
*  is making sure of the safe and humane legal transparent care and custody of our detainees.
*  And so, you know, this fully falls into that humane part.
*  We want to make sure that we're caring.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  The safe legal humane thing.
*  Raul said part of its power was in just how long it was.
*  It didn't roll off the tongue, but what it did do was,
*  it was just long enough to make you roll your eyes or not ask those questions or be inconvenienced.
*  You know, it was just long enough.
*  You're so right. We were like so, like,
*  we were so bored by the time you got to the end of that line that we just...
*  Yeah, like you're not going to get anything from us and we're going to just tire you down.
*  Yeah.
*  What was the worst question a reporter could ask you?
*  Um, Camp Seven.
*  Camp Seven.
*  For nearly 15 years, Camp Seven was the super secret compound
*  where the government held its most important prisoners.
*  These were the people accused of plotting 9-11, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,
*  and other supposedly high-ranking members of Al-Qaeda,
*  prisoners who had been held and tortured in secret CIA prisons overseas.
*  For a long time, everything about Camp Seven was classified.
*  Who was there? What went on there?
*  And certainly its location at Guantanamo, down an unmarked dusty road, tucked away in the scrubby hills.
*  So if a reporter asked a question about Camp Seven, like,
*  if we have extra time, can we look for Camp Seven?
*  Which Sarah did ask...
*  If we have extra time, can we look for Camp Seven?
*  Raul and the other public affairs people would deflect.
*  I've never had anything said to me about Camp Seven. I know nothing about it.
*  I mean, you hear rumors, but as far as what they tell, I don't know anything about it.
*  What are the rumors?
*  That there's a Camp Seven, a secret Camp Seven, yeah.
*  Raul got the impression they were supposed to act as if it wasn't worth thinking about,
*  like it might not even be real.
*  It doesn't exist. Don't even ask about it.
*  It's a media thing.
*  Like a media myth?
*  Yep. And it was violently made sure that we didn't know anything.
*  It was like, you don't know anything, don't say you know anything.
*  Colonel Heath is the only one who could talk about it. You know nothing.
*  But he said they did know about Camp Seven.
*  The existence of Camp Seven had been reported nearly eight years before.
*  A simple Google search would surface a rash of information about Camp Seven.
*  The stuff Raul had learned in his public affairs training about transparency and truth in journalism,
*  he took it seriously. But now he was starting to feel uncomfortable.
*  We didn't have this experience of being shady. We didn't have this experience of telling lies.
*  There was a point where we all were so drained that that's when a lot of us signed up to do that secret mission I told you about.
*  The secret mission? After the break.
*  Raul's secret mission came a few months into his deployment.
*  He didn't really know what he was signing up for.
*  He just knew it was a chance to get away from the tours and the reporters and work inside the prison.
*  The mission was combat camera. It's not specific to Guantanamo.
*  It's a regular military job. Instead of carrying a weapon during an operation,
*  you carry a camera to document it for the commanders and for posterity, I suppose.
*  Although the DOD has never released combat camera recordings from the prison.
*  Raul's job on combat camera was to film the detainees who were on hunger strike
*  as they were forced from their cells and then force fed.
*  He didn't really have a problem with the idea of force feeding the hunger strikers.
*  It was an act of protest. And so the military had to keep them alive.
*  I mean, what are they going to do?
*  Could you imagine the story that gets out if a detainee died on our watch because they starved to death?
*  During his shifts, Raul would sit in the combat camera office until a call came in.
*  He'd make his way to the cell block in a golf cart.
*  And then wearing a face shield for protection, he would film the guards as they burst into a prisoner cell,
*  strapped the prisoner to a board and carried him out.
*  Next, the guards would put the prisoner in a feeding chair.
*  His arms, legs and head all fastened to the chair with straps.
*  Once the prisoner was secured and couldn't move, the medic snaked a feeding tube up his nose
*  and down his throat into his stomach and pumped the insurer or whatever nutrition drink they were using at the time into his body.
*  Raul filmed the whole procedure.
*  Sometimes as the prisoners were being force fed, they would speak directly into his camera.
*  They would talk. They would be like, you know, why am I still here?
*  Can you send me home? You know, I don't want to be here anymore.
*  You know, I'm just like you. I have a son who's your age.
*  There was a certain one that would always talk to me and talk at me because he was used to combat camera.
*  So he would talk at me and tell me to save him and to show those videos to the public.
*  And yeah, I think in the moment I was just very numb to it at that time.
*  I was just numb to it.
*  But he says he kind of had to force himself to be numb.
*  A vague unease was floating around in his psyche.
*  It was easier to ignore it.
*  And that worked OK until one day his perspective on the military and on Guantanamo shifted.
*  What happened was he got in trouble for something that had nothing to do with combat camera.
*  Raul's route to the camp was a little bit different.
*  He was called in for something that had nothing to do with combat camera.
*  Raul's roommate told his commanding officer he thought Raul was having an affair with one of Raul's friends.
*  Raul was married and adultery is a big no-no in the military.
*  An investigation was launched.
*  Raul was put on probation for 60 days and was passed over for promotion.
*  Then months later, Raul got in trouble again for failing a breathalyzer test.
*  All of this was a shock.
*  He says he wasn't having an affair.
*  His roommate was just homophobic.
*  And he says he'd only had one glass of wine, that they gave him a second breathalyzer and he passed.
*  But his commanding officer punished him anyway.
*  He had devoted years of his life to the military.
*  He believed in the military, lived by its definitions of good and bad.
*  Now, suddenly, he was on the outside of the good guys club.
*  Being on the outside, he started looking at things on the inside differently.
*  So when Sarah asked Raul that question you heard earlier about whether he ever struggled over the imprisonment of the detainees,
*  and he gave her that pained answer, he says what was actually going on was he was starting to glitch.
*  To ask himself those same questions Sarah was asking everyone.
*  He was starting to feel complicit in what he called stealing people's lives.
*  Soon after we met him, Raul and his unit returned to Arizona.
*  When they had first deployed to Guantanamo, Raul was a cheerful, confident guy, a model soldier.
*  By the time he left...
*  I came away thinking that I was a piece of shit.
*  A few months after he got home, Raul says he had a panic attack and eventually got a diagnosis of PTSD from Afghanistan and Guantanamo.
*  Which is striking considering in 2011 and 2012 when Raul was in Afghanistan, we were actively fighting a war there.
*  Hundreds of Americans were killed in Afghanistan during those two years.
*  And then here he was at Caribbean Guantanamo Bay where he could sip pina coladas in the sunshine and go to the beach if he wanted.
*  And he comes home and falls apart.
*  I think it's weird that I don't have any negative ties to what happened in Afghanistan and what happened in Kosovo.
*  And I assume because I trained for those possibilities.
*  We go through, we have a simulation of what it's like to be flipped over in a truck sideways and upside down.
*  And you have to navigate yourself and unbuckle yourself inside of a Humvee.
*  Like those are the trainings we do.
*  So I was trained for Afghanistan.
*  I was trained for Kosovo.
*  You cannot train for Guantanamo Bay.
*  You cannot train for a thing if you don't know what it is.
*  If the people around you aren't being honest about the whole trembling heart of the endeavor.
*  What made Guantanamo so confusing was that to satisfy our terrified post-9-11 needs,
*  we had to shove aside the old time-tested rules about how to treat war prisoners.
*  And for the ordinary people who had to operate inside the new rules,
*  there was a gap between what they were being told and what they were seeing for themselves.
*  Thousands upon thousands of military personnel, hundreds of prisoners.
*  Everybody trying to bridge that gap.
*  Everybody scrambling through the same experiment.
*  This season of serial, a history of Guantanamo told by people who know things the rest of us don't
*  about the consequences of an improvised justice system.
*  It's going to be six stories, starting with a guy who acted out the stuff of nightmares,
*  which at the time, all part of his job.
*  That's next time.
