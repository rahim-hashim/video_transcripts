# The U.N. Scandal Threatening Crucial Aid to Gaza
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWt95wMsKSw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  We turn now to Israel, where a growing list of countries around the world have suspended
*  funding to a UN refugee agency for Palestinians.
*  Israel has now shared its intelligence, claiming at least 13 UN aid workers actually took part
*  in the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7th.
*  Late last month, an explosive allegation that workers from a crucial UN relief agency in
*  Gaza had taken part in the October 7th attacks stunned the world and prompted major donors,
*  including the US, to suspend funding.
*  Today, Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley on what this could mean for the humanitarian
*  crisis in Gaza and how it might complicate Israel's strategy in the war.
*  It's Tuesday, February 6th.
*  Patrick, hi.
*  Hi Sabrina.
*  So the last time we talked, late last year, there was this growing humanitarian crisis
*  in Gaza.
*  Most of the population had been displaced.
*  Disease and hunger were starting to emerge as bigger and bigger problems.
*  Now the situation has gotten worse.
*  And in the midst of all of this, the main UN relief agency in Gaza, known as UNRWA,
*  has been engulfed in scandal over accusations that some of its staff actually played a role
*  in the October 7th attack.
*  So tell me the story and what we know.
*  What we know is this.
*  On January 18th, the head of UNRWA, Philippe Azzarini, went to what was expected to be
*  a routine meeting with a senior Israeli diplomat to discuss delivery of aid and fuel to Gaza,
*  the supplies that UNRWA helps to coordinate.
*  Instead, the Israeli diplomat dropped a bombshell accusation.
*  He claimed that roughly a dozen employees of Umbra had either participated in the Hamas-led
*  raid on Israel on October 7th or, in one case, in its aftermath.
*  Wow.
*  So that is quite a bombshell.
*  It's a very serious allegation.
*  This is just a small, tiny minority of the 13,000 employees of Umbra in Gaza.
*  But nevertheless, it's too many.
*  And certainly not what you expect of a UN agency that is devoted to neutrality and humanitarianism.
*  Right.
*  So actually, tell us what this agency does in Gaza.
*  Umbra is the main aid organization for Palestinians that is run by the United Nations.
*  In times outside war, it provides education and primary health care for roughly five million
*  Palestinians across the Middle East, including more than a million in Gaza itself.
*  It runs hundreds of schools and provides education for roughly 300,000 Gaza children.
*  Since the war has begun, it has been the primary supplier of shelter to displaced Palestinians.
*  More than half the population is now living in an Umbra facility.
*  Schools and other facilities have provided a roof over the head of some 1.2 million Gaza
*  since the start of the war.
*  A crucial organization, especially in this moment.
*  Yes, absolutely.
*  And after that meeting with the senior Israeli diplomat, Lazzarini, the head of Umbra, begins
*  to fire nine of the employees who are accused of participating in the attack.
*  Two of them, we believe, are already dead and at least one of them in the attack itself.
*  Then the UN starts to tell the donor states that provide Umbra with most of its funding,
*  chief among them, the United States.
*  And that led to senior American diplomats being briefed on the claims and they were presented
*  by Israeli officials with a dossier outlining these claims.
*  On that same day, Umbra decided to announce to the world that these allegations have been
*  made against some of their employees and that some of them had already been fired.
*  Now, the UN has fired nine Umbra members.
*  We understand two more are being looked into.
*  And that news led the United States and then a cascade of more than a dozen other countries
*  to suspend their funding for Umbra pending further investigation.
*  The US has paused funding to the UN agency that is actually providing aid to the Palestinians.
*  Canada announced it too has temporarily paused any additional funding.
*  The latest to hold aid being Germany.
*  Japan and Austria became the latest countries to suspend payments.
*  And this came on the same day.
*  Hours after the UN's top court ordered Israel to take measures to prevent acts of genocide
*  in Gaza.
*  The International Court of Justice in The Hague had ruled that in order to prevent a
*  genocide, Israel needed to supply more aid to Gaza.
*  And so at a time when more aid was supposed to be coming into Gaza, the UN's biggest aid
*  agency was running the risk of collapse.
*  The head of UNRWA is calling for all those nations who are suspending funding right now
*  to change their minds.
*  Given the desperate plight of so many, this would be a heavy blow if UNRWA's operations
*  were suspended in some way.
*  And indeed, we've been told by UNRWA's leadership that if the funds aren't restored by the end
*  of February, it will struggle to operate.
*  That could have grave implications for the distribution of aid and the provision of shelter
*  to more than a million Gazans just at the wrong time.
*  Just as we're told that famine is looming in parts of Gaza.
*  More than half the buildings in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to UN estimates.
*  And around 2 million people out of 2.2 million have been displaced.
*  So it couldn't be happening, this convergence of events at a worse time.
*  Right, an already bad situation is likely to get a lot worse for Gazans.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  What were the actual charges, Patrick?
*  I mean, what did you learn about that?
*  Well, to begin with, it really wasn't clear what the specific allegations were.
*  We had this statement from UNRWA saying that there were claims against various employees.
*  There was talk of a dossier, but no one was releasing any information.
*  So what me and our colleague, Ronen Bergman, did, we spent the weekend calling up as many
*  sources as we could reach, trying to find out exactly what this dossier had said.
*  And two days after the allegations broke, we finally got our hands on the dossier itself.
*  And what it alleged was shocking.
*  It said that, for example, one of the employees, a teacher, had been involved in a raid on
*  the Israeli village of Be'erri, where roughly 100 people were killed during the October 7th attack.
*  It said another person was involved in the kidnapping of a woman.
*  It said that a third person was involved in the capture of a soldier's corpse on October 7th.
*  And so on and so on. The list went on.
*  The dossier said the information was mainly taken from wiretaps of people's phones,
*  and also through the geolocation of people's phones on the day of October 7th.
*  We could only confirm the identity of one of the people accused, but we had no way of
*  verifying the material ourselves.
*  All we knew was that UNRWA had decided themselves to take action, both firing nine people
*  and announcing the news publicly.
*  And that wasn't all.
*  The dossier also had another claim, an even bigger claim, that had not previously been reported.
*  And that was that according to the Israeli military, roughly a tenth of UNRWA's staff
*  of 13,000 inside Gaza were affiliated or members of Hamas and other militant factions.
*  Wow.
*  And this was an astonishing claim for an agency that is supposed to be neutral,
*  supposed to be independent of political groups, let alone armed groups.
*  Right.
*  And once again, this was an impossible to verify claim, and the Israelis have not publicly
*  produced any evidence to support it.
*  Nevertheless, they say that this calculation is taken by cross-referencing a list of UNRWA
*  staff members in Gaza with lists or a list of Hamas members that the Israeli military
*  had taken during its invasion of Gaza from computers that they found in Hamas bases inside
*  the territory.
*  But Patrick, what exactly does Israel mean when it says 10% of the staff, some 1300 people,
*  were considered members of Hamas?
*  Like, are we talking about militants?
*  Are we talking about government bureaucrats?
*  Because, of course, Hamas is the government of Gaza.
*  The claim was that roughly 200 of those 1300 were involved in militant activities.
*  The rest of the 1300s, so the vast majority, were people involved in the political movement
*  or the social movement of Hamas.
*  Remember that Hamas is not just an armed faction that fires rockets at Israel or that attacked
*  Israel on October 7th.
*  It's also a social movement that has deep roots in society and helps to run a civilian
*  government.
*  And there is quite a lot of overlap between its membership and the general population
*  of Gaza, which is not to say that the majority of Gazans are affiliated with Hamas, but just
*  to say that in a way, it's not that surprising that any large institution in Gaza would have
*  some level of overlap with a political movement and a social movement as large as Hamas.
*  AMRA takes its staff predominantly in Gaza from the population of Gaza.
*  The 13,000 AMRA staff members are mostly not international aid workers from other countries.
*  They come from the place that they are working in, Gaza.
*  And, indeed, if you go anywhere in the world, any experienced aid worker will tell you that
*  it's a constant challenge to maintain independence from any armed group or rebel group, be it
*  in South Sudan or Northern Sri Lanka.
*  And these are common challenges that affect the aid sector or wherever they work.
*  All that said, the UN is supposed to be a politically neutral body, and that's what
*  gives the UN its gravitas and its power.
*  This is an institution that's meant to be above politics, above division, and it's not
*  supposed to be compromised by any party to a conflict.
*  So its workers should not be members of Hamas or any other Palestinian political armed group,
*  for that matter.
*  Right.
*  If it's true, this claim would be hugely damning.
*  Yes.
*  And once this information, this 10% figure, was brought to the attention of the wider
*  world, it cemented in the eyes of AMRA's critics the idea that something was rotten
*  within AMRA.
*  And that came as more countries suspended their funding.
*  And it led, a couple of days later...
*  And I think it's time that the international community and the UN itself understand that
*  UNRWA's mission has to end.
*  To Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, breaking his silence on the issue, calling
*  specifically for AMRA's dissolution.
*  There are other agencies in the UN, there are other agencies in the world, they have
*  to replace UNRWA.
*  What, if anything, has Hamas said about this?
*  I mean, do they confirm or deny that these folks are in fact members of Hamas?
*  So I asked the Hamas folks that question and didn't get a clear answer.
*  What they have publicly said is that they condemn AMRA for criticizing the actions
*  of anyone who has participated in what they see as legitimate resistance against Israel,
*  but what much of the world sees as acts of brutal terrorism.
*  And they also criticized AMRA for firing some of its employees based on material given
*  to it by Hamas' enemy, Israel.
*  So Patrick, this relationship between AMRA and Hamas is very fraught.
*  AMRA is responsible for critical services in Gaza, you know, social safety net for a
*  big swath of the country.
*  And that's in normal times.
*  And has to navigate working side by side with the government, which is Hamas, which is considered
*  a terrorist group by the U.S. and the EU and others.
*  And now in the midst of the war, AMRA is even more critical to the people of Gaza who
*  are trying to survive the bombardments and the invasion following Hamas' October 7th
*  attack on Israel.
*  But AMRA is also now facing the scrutiny for having staff associated with that attack.
*  So that's all very complicated.
*  It's hugely complicated.
*  AMRA is independent of Hamas.
*  It's got formerly nothing to do with the group, but it nevertheless operates within a dictatorial
*  regime in which Hamas is the ruler.
*  And that forces it to work side by side with Hamas.
*  And at the same time, they also have to coordinate with the Israeli armed forces in order to
*  ensure that aid and other supplies and also their own international employees can enter
*  and exit Gaza.
*  So this has all been very difficult to navigate for years.
*  During the 2021 war with Israel, for example, or just after it, the most senior AMRA official
*  in Gaza made comments that were perceived to be favorable towards Israel's military
*  operations.
*  And there was such an outcry in Gaza and from Hamas because of that, that this official
*  was withdrawn from AMRA.
*  But from the Israeli perspective, this kind of tension between AMRA and Hamas is a fig
*  leaf that obscures a more symbiotic relationship in which AMRA is not fully independent and
*  operates, in their view, under Hamas's influence.
*  AMRA denies that completely and says that it's totally neutral.
*  But nevertheless, the accusation has long been that AMRA works under the influence of Hamas.
*  So in a way, this latest incident is just one in a long line of flashpoints between
*  AMRA and Israel that goes back decades.
*  If for Palestinians AMRA is an icon and something of a protector, to many Israelis, it's a consistent
*  problem.
*  And this latest incident simply confirmed perceptions that Israelis have long held about
*  the group.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, you said that many in Israel have long believed that AMRA is a consistent problem.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  What I mean is they take issue with what they say that the agency fundamentally stands for.
*  And that goes all the way back to the reasons why it was founded in 1949, a year after Israel
*  was founded.
*  At that time you had roughly more than 700,000 Palestinian refugees who had fled or been forced
*  from their homes during the wars that surrounded the creation of the state of Israel.
*  And to care for those refugees who had been scattered all across the Middle East, in Lebanon,
*  in Jordan, and in Gaza, the UN founded one of the first UN agencies in its history.
*  It was called the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA for short.
*  And its job was to provide education and other services to those refugees.
*  And for the 74 years since, it has basically acted implicitly, if not directly, to maintain
*  the identity of those Palestinian refugees and to, in the Israeli view, sustain the idea
*  in those refugees' minds that one day, because they're refugees, they might actually return
*  to the place that they were forced from.
*  And they might one day come back, live in the homes that their families lived in, in
*  what became Israel.
*  But to Israelis, that is an enormously threatening idea because if you had five million Palestinians
*  returning to Israel, as these refugees and their descendants now number, it would completely
*  dilute the Jewish character of the Jewish state, and Israelis don't want that.
*  To Israelis, it's also threatening because the idea of five million people coming from
*  territory where Israel has fought many wars for decades with is a security threat.
*  It's also a logistical threat.
*  How would it work if five million people or even a small minority come to Israel and try
*  to move into the villages where they once lived, many of which were destroyed?
*  Then there's another perspective, which more or less acknowledges all the criticisms that
*  Israel makes about the very character of the institution of UNRWA.
*  But in the Palestinian perspective, this is a good thing.
*  While many people who are classified today as Palestinian refugees were not alive in
*  1948, they nevertheless feel that it is their right to return to land on which their ancestors
*  lived on many years previously.
*  So in a sense, there's quite a lot of common ground between the Israeli and Palestinian
*  perspective of UNRWA.
*  One side just thinks its existence is a bad thing, and the other thinks it's a good thing.
*  So I guess I get how this agency could symbolically represent a threat to Israel.
*  But in reality, how much is this aid organization actually a threat to the state of Israel?
*  How much are they actually working toward Palestinians getting to return to what is
*  now Israel?
*  Well, the claim is not that the leaders of UNRWA are going around directly mobilizing
*  Palestinian refugees to return to Israel.
*  A lot of the debate around UNRWA centers on what is taught in its schools.
*  In Israel, it has not gone unnoticed that of the dozen people accused of participating
*  in the October 7th attack, several of them were either teachers or workers in those schools.
*  And the curriculums in those schools have also come under tremendous Israeli scrutiny.
*  In one case, researchers highlighted how a textbook glorified a Palestinian militant
*  who was involved in a terror attack on Israeli civilians in the 1970s called Dalal Mugrabi.
*  And in other cases, Israeli researchers have highlighted maps of Palestine published in
*  textbooks used in UNRWA schools that do not include the state of Israel.
*  UNRWA has, in some cases, acknowledged these criticisms and has said it's taken action
*  to withdraw those particular materials from circulation.
*  And Palestinians, for their part, also make similar criticisms of the Israeli education
*  system where you often see maps of Israel that don't include the West Bank or Gaza
*  or assume that the West Bank is part of the state of Israel.
*  And Palestinians, in general, point out that the education system that is provided in UNRWA
*  and in other parts of the Palestinian education system is of a fairly good standard.
*  The literacy rate among Palestinians stands at 95%, which is nearly 10 points higher
*  than the global average.
*  The other major criticism that Israelis make about UNRWA is that it somehow turns a blind
*  eye to Hamas' militant activity, that Hamas or other militant groups have stored ammunition
*  inside UNRWA facilities or have fired rockets from very close to UNRWA schools or even dug
*  tunnels underneath its buildings.
*  And UNRWA says that when it finds out about this, it takes action and has even publicized
*  some of these transgressions itself.
*  And ultimately, it can't do much if people fire rockets from close to its schools.
*  It's not an armed institution and has no means of combating that.
*  So for the critics of UNRWA, the idea is basically that UNRWA is supporting the Hamas agenda,
*  which is, of course, the destruction of Israel, through propaganda and then looking the other
*  way when Hamas uses their facilities for war.
*  But UNRWA is saying, we don't have a military to stop any of this stuff.
*  We're just trying to provide services the best we can in an extremely difficult environment.
*  Yes.
*  And that's why an allegation like the ones we've been hearing in recent days have been
*  so damaging because it suggests that UNRWA isn't just an independent institution working
*  within a difficult environment, but that it has been infiltrated by people who are members
*  of the group that the UN is saying it's independent from.
*  So I have to imagine that people who've been making these accusations all of these years
*  are feeling pretty satisfied that these allegations have come to light and are being seen by the
*  world and taken seriously by the world.
*  I think yes and no.
*  Some people are delighted.
*  They're saying we've always said this and finally these ideas are getting prime time.
*  Others may agree fundamentally that UNRWA is this nefarious organization, but they don't
*  feel this is the time to try and bring it down because as much as they dislike the premise
*  of what UNRWA stands for, they recognize that it plays a huge and important role in sustaining
*  life ultimately during a devastating war that has killed roughly one in a hundred Garzons,
*  according to Garzón official estimates.
*  And they don't have a plan for what could replace UNRWA and who could step in, who has
*  the manpower and the logistical footprint to deliver aid, to provide shelter.
*  And there are fears that if UNRWA collapses, it would hugely worsen what is already a very
*  dire humanitarian situation.
*  I've spoken to Israeli officials and former officials and they see it as part of a lack
*  of strategic planning on the part of the Israeli government, which is avoiding very difficult
*  questions about what Israel wants to see in Gaza after the war ends.
*  For some of them, it's also exactly the wrong thing to be doing at a time when Israel stands
*  accused of genocide.
*  And in particular, when the world's highest court, the International Court of Justice
*  in The Hague, has just ordered Israel to prevent genocide, in part by increasing more aid to
*  Gaza.
*  And on the same day that that order was made, we instead see a number of countries start
*  pulling funding for the biggest aid operation in the Gaza Strip, which raises questions
*  about whether in fact we'll see less aid rather than more.
*  Right.
*  Obviously, the question of aid is most critical to the ongoing struggle of Gazans to simply
*  survive this war.
*  But for Israel, the idea that the main aid agency in Gaza would be hobbled and therefore
*  the humanitarian crisis there would get worse is both a practical problem but also a problem
*  for how the world sees Israel in this moment.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's a perception problem for Israel, but it's also a perception problem for many of
*  the Western countries, including the United States, who were the first to pull funding
*  for Umbra as this scandal broke.
*  If Israel has a reputation problem as a result of this war, so too does the United States
*  and the Biden administration because of its support for Israel and its own reputation
*  and perceptions of its intentions are also wrapped up in Israel's fate and Gaza's.
*  Yeah, it's a very tricky situation for the US and other funders.
*  On the one hand, they don't want to be perceived as having anything to do with anyone who has
*  anything to do with Hamas.
*  On the other hand, they also don't want to be seen as being responsible in any way for
*  this humanitarian crisis, one that will get worse if the one real aid organization goes
*  away.
*  Exactly.
*  But we have seen attempts by US officials to cast this suspension in a different light.
*  We've seen stories come out saying that actually the US was not due to send more funding for
*  a while and that the last remaining tranche of the funding it was supposed to provide
*  in this particular funding cycle was minimal and that in essence, the suspension was more
*  of a symbolic move than one that would actually have practical effect on Umbra's budget.
*  So kind of trying to walk it back a bit.
*  Exactly.
*  All that said, while the US is the main funder or the largest funder of Umbra, the collective
*  effect of all the other suspensions from more than a dozen other countries could well be
*  damaging enough to leave Umbra in major trouble.
*  And according to Umbra, it could go out of business, they say, by the end of the month,
*  because there are so many other suspensions of funding from other sources.
*  So actually, many in Israel, the US and countries around the world and most of all, Gazans,
*  are aligned in having pretty serious interest in Umbra not collapsing right now.
*  Exactly.
*  And the key words there are right now.
*  While this war goes on, certainly there is a strange and perhaps surprising alignment
*  of interests, if not motives.
*  Right.
*  In the long term, of course, there remain profound disagreements, not only about the
*  future of Umbra, but the future of Gaza and who should govern it.
*  What role should Hamas play?
*  What role should Israel play?
*  What role should other Palestinian leaders play?
*  And of course, what role should Umbra play and should it play any role at all?
*  Israel wants to see a completely different architecture of aid agencies and aid distribution.
*  I think it's entirely the wrong time to be discussing revamping the aid system in a territory
*  where more than 80% of people are displaced, more than half the buildings are damaged or
*  destroyed and one in a hundred people has been killed.
*  Patrick, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  The Times reports that UNRWA is set to lose at least $65 million by the end of February
*  as funding cuts made by donors begin to kick in.
*  In all, 18 states or institutions announced suspensions of funding.
*  Some, like the United States, had already made scheduled payments, but others, including
*  Finland, Germany, Japan and Sweden, had not and are now set to miss them.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Monday, a powerful storm pummeled California for a second day, with wind and rain causing
*  flooding, mudslides and widespread power outages.
*  The relentless downpour, which began on Sunday morning, dumped a record amount of rain on
*  Los Angeles, making Sunday the tenth wettest day in the history of the city.
*  At least three people died across the state, including from falling trees in northern California.
*  On Monday afternoon, as the rain continued, officials warned of the potential danger of
*  more flooding and mudslides.
