# Inside Trump’s Search for a Vice President
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShIIUwVfS4Q)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is the Daily.
*  The makeup of the 2024 presidential race has felt inevitable from the start, with one notable
*  exception, Donald Trump's choice of a running mate.
*  Today, my colleague Mike Bender examines the top contenders for the job and what choosing
*  them would tell us about Trump himself in this campaign.
*  It's Thursday, June 13th.
*  Mike, somehow this is your first appearance on the show, so welcome at long last to the
*  Daily.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  It's my pleasure.
*  You have spent the past few weeks trying to get inside Donald Trump's search for a vice
*  And what is so unusual about this search is that we already know what Trump wanted in
*  a vice president from his 2016 campaign when he picked Mike Pence, and we know how badly
*  that all ended with Trump openly denouncing Pence for not helping him overturn his 2020
*  election loss and reportedly endorsing calls for Pence's death, his hanging at the Capitol
*  on January 6th.
*  So with all of that behind us, what is Trump looking for this time around?
*  Yeah, I mean, the search is very different from where he was at this time eight years
*  ago.
*  Eight years ago, he was a first time candidate and he needed credibility with the evangelical
*  community.
*  I mean, remember, Donald Trump is a thrice married playboy from New York whose sex life
*  was splashed across the New York tabloids, adding Mike Pence to the ticket gave him a
*  lot of credibility with evangelicals and with establishment Republicans.
*  Pence was a governor of Indiana and had been a former congressman.
*  He provided a sort of port of entry for these folks into Trump world and settled a lot of
*  them down.
*  It's a very different calculus this time around.
*  Trump believes voters are going to make their decision based on the top of the ticket, not
*  their running mate.
*  Based on Trump himself.
*  And the fact that we have two incumbents effectively running.
*  Everyone who's going to vote in this election has opinions formed about Biden and Trump.
*  There's really no one that he can add to the ticket that is going to make a giant difference
*  or going to persuade people in a major way to come on board.
*  And he's probably right about that.
*  So in a way, you're saying Trump's search for number two is defined by what it's not
*  focused on, which is he's not trying to solve a political problem through his vice presidential
*  pick.
*  That's right.
*  He's not giving a lot of value to a political upside of a candidate.
*  There's a lot of chatter early on, you remember, about maybe adding a woman to the ticket.
*  Trump has hemorrhaged support from suburban women for eight years.
*  And there was a thought that if he could find a strong woman in the governor's office or
*  in Congress to add to the ticket, that she could help persuade some of these folks back
*  to Trump's side.
*  But my reporting here is that there were some women in consideration at the very beginning
*  stages of this process, but he hasn't seriously considered a woman for this job in quite a
*  while now.
*  Fascinating.
*  OK, so we've been focused a lot, Mike, on what Trump is not focused on in his VP search.
*  Let's turn to what he is putting a lot of weight on as he searches for a number two.
*  Well, right now, my reporting is that the biggest factor, the biggest through line through
*  some of his top tier candidates are folks I'm calling do no harm candidates.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  The best example of this is Kristi Noem and what not to do.
*  Kristi Noem is the governor of South Dakota.
*  She has long been a rising star in the party.
*  She's joined Trump on the campaign trail several times, very much wanted this job.
*  But Governor Kristi Noem has had, let's call it a tough time lately with that story that
*  just won't go away.
*  It all came crashing down a couple of months ago when she put a book out.
*  It includes a bizarre story about her shooting and killing her dog.
*  Detailing how she dragged her 14 month old dog, Cricket, out to her gravel pit and shot
*  it dead.
*  After killing her dog, she says she also killed their goat.
*  What the hell was South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem thinking?
*  This set off a firestorm in the media.
*  What a charming anecdote to include in a book.
*  Who was her editor?
*  Where even Fox News hosts couldn't get enough of this.
*  In your new book, it's called No Going Back, you include a story about shooting your dog.
*  And kept asking her.
*  Did the dog story come up in your conversation with Trump?
*  I talk to President Trump all the time.
*  About the dog?
*  About a lot of things.
*  And right now...
*  To explain Cricket, to explain the dog.
*  Did you bring up the dog?
*  Yes, enough Stuart.
*  Did you bring up the dog with Trump?
*  This interview is ridiculous what you are doing right now.
*  So you need to stop.
*  It is.
*  Okay.
*  It is.
*  And to the great frustration of Trump.
*  He was telling people that he did not want to be out answering questions about a vice
*  presidential candidate who shot their dog.
*  It even became kind of Gallo's humor for him at some point.
*  Randomly in conversations, he would ask people, well have you shot your dog?
*  He would end conversations telling people, make sure you don't shoot your dog.
*  This is an example of something Trump does not want to deal with on the campaign trail.
*  That probably goes for just about any presidential candidate.
*  But what is particularly important for Trump right now is that his plate is full of distractions.
*  He was just convicted of 34 felonies in New York.
*  And has a litany of other legal problems he is facing.
*  So the most important thing for him right now is a vice presidential candidate who is
*  a disciplined campaigner and can go out there and not cause any more unwanted distractions
*  for his campaign.
*  All right.
*  So besides do me no harm, where else is Trump putting his focus in a VP search?
*  Yeah, the eventual VP is going to have to meet Trump's prime time reality TV show version
*  of being out of central casting.
*  And what I mean by that in this context is he wants someone who can go on television
*  and defend him ably and effectively.
*  The other thing that's very interesting to me is that the former president gives outsized
*  importance to debate performance.
*  He believes that he won the election in 2016 in large part because of his own performance
*  in the debates against Hillary Clinton.
*  And for that reason, since then really, he's felt like debates can be determinative and
*  want someone who he feels comfortable can go on television and hold his own against
*  Kamala Harris, a seasoned politician, former prosecutor.
*  So whoever Trump picks is going to have to be able to hold his own in this sort of arena.
*  But it's always a fine line with Trump.
*  They're going to have to perform well, be effective, but not effective enough where
*  they start to approach Trump's spotlight.
*  Say more about that.
*  Yeah, I mean, this is a president who puts a very high value on loyalty, but it's a very
*  unique twist on loyalty.
*  He has a very specific definition.
*  The sort of first rule of proving loyalty to Trump is not to overshadow him.
*  He doesn't want someone out there who he feels like is trying to leverage his political brand.
*  Trump does not really want a successor here.
*  A lot of presidential nominees will pick someone who can help build the party, particularly
*  in a second term, the attention naturally turns to the vice president and who's coming
*  next.
*  Trump has shown little interest in that.
*  So while he wants someone who will be a great presence on TV and on the campaign trail,
*  that running mate better be good, but not too good.
*  So in summary, Trump's VP search goes something like this.
*  I don't really care if you win me a key voting block.
*  Don't cause me problems.
*  And while I want you to be able to wow an audience, you can't wow them more than me.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  And based on those principles, his team has actually put out a pretty extensive list of
*  Republicans who they are vetting for the job right now.
*  But my reporting is that this list is a little wider than the folks who Trump is really considering.
*  His team is trying to build drama and suspense and also give him some room to change his
*  mind before he officially makes his pick at the Republican National Convention in July.
*  But at this moment, based on my reporting, there are three people who Trump is seriously
*  considering for his next vice president.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Mike, tell us about these top three contenders at this moment for Trump's vice presidential
*  slot and how Trump is thinking about each of them.
*  Yeah, one we can start with is the senator from Ohio, JD Vance.
*  Despite all outward appearances, I'm a cultural outsider.
*  I didn't come from the elites.
*  Most listeners will probably remember JD Vance as the guy who burst onto the national scene
*  with a book about his time growing up in Ohio.
*  I came from a southern Ohio steel town, and it's a town that's really struggling in a
*  lot of ways, in ways that are indicative of the broader struggles of America's working class.
*  That sort of explained the forgotten man and woman in America right at the time that Trump
*  was leveraging that idea to become president of the United States.
*  Right.
*  Here with me is JD Vance, author of Kill Billy Elegy.
*  JD has been unlocking the mysteries to Donald Trump's appeal.
*  JD Vance went on a national book tour.
*  He was on television, on podcasts, talking about his book.
*  Donald Trump, if nothing else, is relatable to the average working class American because
*  he speaks off the cuff, even if half of the things that he says don't make any sense or
*  a quarter of the things that he says are offensive.
*  But also talking pretty negatively about Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  I can't stomach Trump.
*  I think that he's noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.
*  I mean, he was really scathing in how he depicted Donald Trump as effectively a con artist who
*  was taking advantage of the people that he was writing about to sort of fuel his political rise.
*  Look, I wasn't a big Trump guy in 2016, but I think he did a good job.
*  Until he changed his mind on Trump.
*  That's why I supported him in 2020.
*  And I think the recognition that I changed my mind is one of the reasons why the president
*  came and endorsed me.
*  And that comes a few years later when Vance decides to run for Senate in 2022.
*  I actually aligned with the America First movement on the core issues.
*  By then he had come 180 degrees on Trump.
*  Trump was right that we need to make things in this country again so that we're self-sufficient.
*  And this works for Vance.
*  He wins Trump's endorsement, beats a pretty crowded field for the Republican nomination
*  in Ohio and wins election in 2022, which if you remember, it was a pretty tough year
*  for Trump endorsements.
*  A lot of Trump picks and big states lost.
*  And JD Vance was sort of the crown jewel of that election for the former president.
*  So a rather convenient transformation from Trump critic to Trump fan results in JD Vance
*  winning a seat in the US Senate.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  He has become one of Trump's fiercest defenders in the Senate.
*  Support the president, volunteer for him, donate for him, and please, for the love of
*  God, vote for him in November.
*  And he's a constant presence on the media circuit.
*  Number one, I'm here for the simple reason to show support for a friend.
*  I think this trial is absolutely ridiculous.
*  I think it's a sham prosecution.
*  Most recently, he was in Manhattan sitting with Trump in the courtroom.
*  I think this is disgraceful.
*  I don't care what you call it, Wolf.
*  I think this proceeding, this legal proceeding is disgraceful.
*  And then fighting for Trump, defending him, and criticizing the prosecution in front of
*  the TV cameras afterward.
*  I don't care what you call this, but this is not the America that I know and love.
*  Why aren't we talking about inflation, Wolf?
*  Why aren't we talking about Biden's wide open southern border?
*  This entire trial was cooked up to distract from Joe Biden's failures.
*  This is exactly what Trump wants in a vice president.
*  Vance is maybe the best in this top tier at defending Trump publicly.
*  He knows when to become a fire breathing ideologue.
*  He knows when to turn the temperature down and become self-effacing and sort of brush
*  off tough questions.
*  Got it.
*  So he's definitely got the very good on TV box checked.
*  And as you said earlier in our conversation, that's just essential.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  But I do think when it comes to Senator Vance, some of these strengths could be risks for
*  him when it comes to making Trump's ticket.
*  He is very ambitious and he is very young.
*  If Vice President Vance is sworn in next year, there will be immediate speculation about
*  his potential running in 2028 as a president.
*  Ah, so you're saying he runs the risk of overshadowing Trump, which is a cardinal sin in Trump's
*  book.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  And right now, in my reporting, that's a strike against Vance when it comes to VP contention.
*  Okay, so Mike, who's next on the list of Trump's top three contenders at the moment?
*  Next on the list is someone you remember well, Michael, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, you were pretty key in covering his 2016 campaign.
*  Right. And like Vance, Mike, he has been on a very long journey of mocking and then trying
*  to reconcile with Trump.
*  That's exactly right.
*  I mean, Rubio was the rising star of the Republican Party pre-Trump, the son of Cuban immigrants
*  with a very powerful story of his own bootstraps rise and was seen as a potential frontrunner
*  for the Republican nomination until Trump showed up on the scene.
*  He doesn't sweat because his pores are clogged from the spray tan that he uses.
*  And Rubio's response to Trump was pretty wild.
*  Donald is not going to make America great.
*  He's going to make America orange.
*  What Rubio did was basically try to match Trump with schoolyard taunts.
*  Then he asked for a full length mirror.
*  I don't know why, because the podium goes up to here, but he wanted a full length mirror.
*  Maybe to make sure his pants weren't wet.
*  I don't know.
*  He went after Trump on the debate stage.
*  If he builds the wall the way he built Trump Towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor
*  to do it.
*  You know, went after his personal life as, you know, the three divorces.
*  Well, I don't know anything about bankrupting four companies.
*  His multiple bankruptcies and in pretty colorful language.
*  So I'm looking at little Marco and I say, man, there's something happening with him.
*  Trump returned fire even more so and really just demolished Rubio in aggressively personal terms.
*  And I see him starting to sweat like I have never seen anything like it.
*  Said how much he was sweating on the stage.
*  Thank God he has really large ears, the biggest ears I've ever seen.
*  Made fun of his ears, portrayed him as a lightweight who shouldn't be president, couldn't go toe
*  to toe with any other foreign leaders and really set him back politically.
*  You know, I called him a lightweight.
*  I said at one point he was a lightweight.
*  And I don't mean to be insulting, but I do describe people somehow well.
*  I mean, suffice it to say, by the end of the 2016 race, the concept that there could ever
*  be a Trump Rubio ticket was completely unfathomable.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But what a lot of people don't realize is that Rubio really repaired that relationship
*  with Trump.
*  Rubio won more votes in his Senate race in Florida than Trump did for president in Florida.
*  And that was oddly important to Trump.
*  He brought that up repeatedly.
*  Trump likes winners, right?
*  And Rubio had won more votes than him.
*  So there must be, he must have missed something.
*  He invited Rubio over to the White House early on as sort of a charm offensive with Rubio.
*  In the next few years, Rubio really did become a behind the scenes close advisor for Trump
*  on foreign policy and some other areas.
*  And now heading into 2024, Trump trusts him, views him as a valuable ally, and maybe even
*  more than that, as a pretty effective attack dog.
*  Right now with Joe Biden in the White House, our adversaries are going to conclude that
*  there are things they can get away with and they can do because this White House is not
*  strong, they're not prepared, they're not even competent.
*  And I fear what that means.
*  It is a big, big problem.
*  Rubio has gotten very aggressive on television going after the Biden administration and really
*  the president himself.
*  We have another four years of Joe Biden.
*  I don't know what this country is going to look like, but none of us are going to be
*  happy about it.
*  Right.
*  Clearly no accident because he knows he's in contention for the VP spot.
*  Absolutely.
*  Just to put a fine point on it, you would say yes if you were asked to serve as his
*  vice presidential nominee?
*  That would be presumptuous for me.
*  I think anyone who's offered that job to serve this country in the second highest office,
*  assuming everything else in your life makes sense at that moment, if you're interested
*  in serving the country, it's an incredible place to serve.
*  So Rubio clearly checks off a ton of boxes, TV ready, loyal, attack dog, doesn't seem
*  to do any harm to the ticket, I'm guessing here.
*  He's meaningfully older than Vance.
*  Any weaknesses we should make sure to touch on when it comes to Rubio?
*  Yeah, the risks for Rubio are kind of counterintuitive here.
*  The big thing is that Trump isn't sure he really wants the job.
*  He has not sat with Trump in the courtroom as others have.
*  He hasn't become a fixture at the former president's rallies.
*  He's not turned himself into furniture at Mar-a-Lago like other Republicans.
*  This sort of idea that he wants to show Trump he wants the job, but not too badly.
*  It's a strategy with a clear logic here.
*  I mean, again, we talked about protection of Trump's spotlight, but I'm told my reporting
*  is that the strategy has kind of confused Trump.
*  I talked to someone who sat with Trump the other day and Trump asked him point blank,
*  does Rubio even want the job?
*  That's not a good look for the Florida senator.
*  Fascinating.
*  So the flip side of Don't Overshadow Me is make sure that I feel a sufficient amount
*  of your love.
*  And Rubio so far hasn't shown Trump enough love.
*  That's exactly right.
*  Okay, I think that brings us now to the third of these contenders.
*  And probably the least known.
*  This is Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, who would be if he joins a ticket
*  and wins election the first vice president from the great state of North Dakota.
*  So who's Doug Burgum?
*  Who is Doug Burgum?
*  Doug Burgum is a kid that grew up in a small town north of North Dakota, 300 people.
*  The streets weren't even paved.
*  Burgum has amassed his own fortune.
*  Saw my first computer and I said, wow, that's going to change the world.
*  By repeatedly building billion dollar companies, including one he sold to Microsoft.
*  And his fantastic run as a public company got acquired by Microsoft.
*  And then I joined that team and helped build Microsoft.
*  He's close friends with the billionaire, former executive of Microsoft and has a number of
*  other wealthy, rich tech investors on speed dial.
*  This is important for Trump because he likes having connections to rich people who serve
*  as sort of a validation for Trump.
*  If you're serving for me, that enhances Trump's brand and Trump's self-worth.
*  Working with President Trump as a governor was like having a beautiful breeze at your
*  back.
*  I guess I can explain it this way.
*  Trump likes to collect wealthy white men, wealthy white businessmen like they were porcelain
*  dolls.
*  Who are we going to send back to the White House?
*  Trump!
*  That's fantastic.
*  OK, well, besides this rich white porcelain dollage that Trump likes, what is it about
*  Burgum that has drawn Trump's interest in him as a potential VP?
*  Yeah, Burgum is in his mid-60s, which makes him closer to being a generational peer to
*  Trump who's in his late 70s.
*  And Trump likes generational peers.
*  Remember, in 2017, the average age of his cabinet was 62 years old, which was one of
*  the oldest of any recent president.
*  And Trump also likes Burgum's independence, not just financially, but politically.
*  He self-funded his own campaign for governor in 2016.
*  He was an outsider candidate.
*  And won that race and his re-election without really any help from Trump or Trump's political
*  machine.
*  And that's important to Trump when it comes to who he can trust behind the scenes to tell
*  him what he needs to know.
*  He doesn't want someone to do that publicly.
*  He doesn't want to be embarrassed.
*  He doesn't want to be overshadowed.
*  But behind the scenes, he does want some back and forth.
*  He does want to hear different points of view.
*  And when you agree with Trump behind the scenes, he wants to know that it's not because you're
*  afraid that he might turn against you.
*  Other folks who owe their entire political rise to Trump might have trouble connecting
*  with the former president on that level.
*  The folks I've talked to have been in the room with Burgum and Trump have told me they
*  have a very easy dynamic.
*  There's a very clear respect on both sides.
*  And these guys seem to like each other.
*  Hmm.
*  So this is kind of fascinating, Mike.
*  It sounds like one of Burgum's biggest advantages is that his political career has been pretty
*  independent of Trump.
*  He didn't start out as a Trump critic who then needed to bend the knee for his own political
*  survival in the same way that both Vance and Rubio did.
*  Instead, Burgum made his way in politics by his own accord.
*  He doesn't really owe Trump much of anything.
*  And to Trump, that might mean Burgum's more willing to be candid with him, albeit behind
*  the scenes, not publicly.
*  On top of all that, he's older and therefore less of a threat to Trump's spotlight, less
*  at risk of overshadowing him.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  I would sum up Burgum's advantages as saying he's probably in this group the safest pick
*  for Trump, but in a weird way, he's also the biggest wild card.
*  And what I mean by that is he is relatively untested on the national stage, even though
*  he did run for president last year, but that was really a short-lived campaign.
*  If you blink, you missed it.
*  And he's not really been on television as much as Rubio and Vance in recent years.
*  And he is, to put it generously, not known for thrilling applause lines on the campaign
*  trail.
*  And he has almost eight years in the governor's office in a very, very Republican state with
*  some very conservative policies that will get dug into by the national media.
*  The big one, I think, is a hugely restrictive abortion law he signed last year as governor.
*  Trump is responsible for overturning Roe vs. Wade, but he sees abortion as a real tough
*  issue for Republicans.
*  And having a running mate who signed a law that bans abortions after six weeks, including
*  no exceptions for rape or incest after six weeks, is going to be a tough one for the
*  ticket in the general election.
*  So Burgum does a lot of the things that Trump wants in a VP, but the problem would seem
*  to be that he might do some harm to the ticket and Trump has that do no harm role.
*  That's absolutely right.
*  When it comes to Trump's decision, the former president has a lot of things to think about.
*  Mike, we've been spending all this time talking about what Trump wants in his VP in 2024 and
*  how these three potential contenders fit into that.
*  But what we haven't talked about to circle back to the beginning and what Trump did to
*  Mike Pence is what Trump may ask of these three guys if they were to become his VP and
*  how comfortable these three contenders might be in doing those things.
*  I mean, everything our colleagues have been reporting so far shows that a second Trump
*  term would involve him testing the bounds of the Constitution.
*  He's going to seek more power than any president has in modern times.
*  He's talked about firing anyone in the government bureaucracy who challenges him.
*  He talked about turning the Department of Justice into a tool for revenge against his
*  political foes.
*  What does it say about these VP contenders that they want to be the number two in that
*  kind of an administration?
*  To orbit Trump is to put at risk your own personal dignity.
*  All of these folks are very smart people who understand that.
*  They know that they're going to be put in some very precarious positions and they're
*  going to have to shift their own thinking when it comes to politics, personal pride,
*  maybe even their legal interpretations of the Constitution.
*  Right.
*  I think about how many people, Mike, in Trump's orbit have been charged with a crime for what
*  they did, for example, around January 6th.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, there are very few people who have put themselves in service of Trump and have
*  emerged for the better.
*  All of these top three contenders have been on their own long journey inside the Republican
*  Party to get to where they are now.
*  And to join Trump's ticket is really an acknowledgement that the old ways of thinking about the Republican
*  Party and Republicanism and conservatism are over and that Trump has won.
*  The reward for that acquiescence is potentially a spot as the number two Republican in the
*  country and possibly next year, the number two position in the most powerful government
*  in the world.
*  Well, Mike, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Wednesday, Southern Baptists voted to oppose the use of in vitro fertilization.
*  It was an indication that ordinary evangelicals are increasingly open to arguments that equate
*  embryos with human life and that fetal personhood may be the next front for the anti-abortion
*  movement.
*  The resolution against IVF adopted at the Southern Baptist annual meeting is notable
*  because fertility treatments are widely used by evangelicals.
*  And officials at the Federal Reserve said they would make a single cut to interest rates
*  this year, suggesting that they are in no hurry to lower historically high borrowing
*  costs.
*  The Fed continues to believe that high interest rates, which remain above 5%, are the best
*  weapon against inflation because they slow spending by both consumers and businesses.
