# Kick Trump Off the Ballot? Even Liberal Justices Are Skeptical
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdphPIxZ5GQ)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  We are following breaking news.
*  The Colorado Supreme Court has ruled that former President Donald Trump will be left
*  off the state's primary and presidential ballots.
*  In December, the Colorado Supreme Court issued a bombshell ruling.
*  This is a historic decision.
*  It's a momentous decision.
*  That said Donald Trump was ineligible to be on the state's ballot for the Republican
*  and presidential primary.
*  Because of his alleged role in the January 6th insurrection.
*  Because it found he had engaged in insurrection on January 6th.
*  It's based on a little known provision that bars people who have engaged in an insurrection
*  from holding government office.
*  Which according to the 14th Amendment disqualifies him from serving as president.
*  It states that anyone engaging in insurrection cannot hold public office.
*  But this is unprecedented constitutional territory, y'all.
*  The Civil War era constitutional provision could knock the leading candidate of one of
*  the two major political parties off the ballot.
*  At the time, we turn to our colleague Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for the
*  To help us understand the meaning of that decision and what could happen next.
*  This really needs to be an issue that is resolved on a nationwide basis.
*  Meaning it has to go to the Supreme Court.
*  And it would be shocking if the Supreme Court would not wade in and issue a ruling on this
*  question that a decade ago would have been impossible to imagine.
*  Just as Adam predicted, the Supreme Court did take the case.
*  And on Thursday, the justices heard arguments for and against keeping Trump off the ballot
*  in Colorado.
*  Today, we turn to Adam once again to analyze those arguments and the responses from the
*  justices and what they reveal about how the high court is likely to rule in a case that
*  could alter the course of this year's race for president.
*  It's Friday, February 9th.
*  Adam, I really like your what do the kids call it?
*  Your fit.
*  Thank you.
*  I like your shirt.
*  It's a very handsome business casual kind of thing going on there.
*  It's barely business, but it is casual.
*  Okay.
*  Okay, so Adam, the clock strikes 10 a.m. or so this morning, Thursday, and the Supreme
*  Court begins to hear this momentous case.
*  Take us into the room.
*  So this is the biggest election case since at least Bush v. Gore, the 2000 decision that
*  handed the presidency to George W. Bush.
*  And now the question is whether Donald Trump is eligible to be on the ballot in Colorado,
*  but really all across the nation under a provision of the Constitution that says if
*  you've sworn an oath to support the Constitution and then engage in insurrection, you may not
*  hold any office.
*  The court had put the case on an exceptionally fast track, partly because ballots in Colorado
*  are going out in a matter of days.
*  Super Tuesday is almost upon us.
*  And the nation needs an answer to whether the leading candidate of one of the political
*  parties is even eligible to hold office.
*  Right.
*  And Colorado, of course, is one of the Super Tuesday states that's going to be holding
*  a Republican primary on March 5th.
*  That's right.
*  So the courtroom, of course, just across the street from the Capitol, where in January
*  6th, 2021, there was the cataclysmic assault on the seat of our government.
*  And you might think that that would have occupied a substantial part of the argument.
*  Right.
*  Given what this case is about.
*  Right.
*  That question of was it an insurrection?
*  Did Donald Trump in sight engage in that insurrection?
*  And although those topics were not wholly absent from the argument, they came up in
*  passing a couple times.
*  That really was not the focus of the argument.
*  This was a legal argument about how the constitutional provision in this case works.
*  OK.
*  Well, let's then talk about the arguments made around that.
*  We'll hear argument this morning in case 23-7-19, Trump versus Anderson.
*  Mr. Mitchell?
*  So there are two basic arguments in the case.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court?
*  Jonathan Mitchell, Trump's lawyer, stands up.
*  The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous
*  independent reasons.
*  He starts off with his lead argument, which is a very close reading of Section 3 of the
*  14th Amendment that the Colorado Supreme Court used to say that Trump is not eligible to
*  be president again.
*  The first reason is that President Trump is not covered by Section 3 because the president
*  is not an officer of the United States, as that term is used throughout the Constitution.
*  It probably helps, Michael, to parse through the words, and there are three different ideas
*  embedded in the amendment.
*  There's first of all, who does it apply to?
*  And it says you have to have previously taken an oath as a member of Congress or as an officer
*  of the United States or as a member of any state legislature or as an executive or judicial
*  officer of any state.
*  Officer of the United States refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass
*  elected individuals such as the president or members of Congress.
*  And he argues that you can't fit the president into the phrase, an officer of the United
*  States, that those are appointed, not elected officials.
*  So that's his first textual argument about who it applies to.
*  Second textual argument, what offices does it apply to?
*  And here I'm going to read a different part of the section.
*  It says no person shall be a senator or representative in Congress or elector of president and vice
*  president or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States.
*  You'll notice the president is not mentioned by name, although he would seem to hold an
*  office, civil or military.
*  But there are arguments again that it doesn't apply.
*  And then there's the phrase hold any office.
*  And Mitchell says, because even if the candidate is an admitted insurrectionist, section three
*  still allows the candidate to run for office and even win election to office.
*  You can't hold an office, but it doesn't say you can't run for office.
*  It doesn't say you can't be elected to office.
*  So if a state banned even an admitted insurrectionist from the ballot, it would be adding to and
*  altering the Constitution's qualifications for office.
*  And he takes some additional comfort from the last clause of section three.
*  Section three cannot be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the ballot, even
*  if that candidate is disqualified from serving as president under section three, because
*  Congress can lift that disability after the candidate is elected, but before he takes
*  office.
*  So he says even someone who is disqualified can run, can be elected, because the moment
*  before Inauguration Day, Congress can say by a two-thirds vote of each house that the
*  person is eligible after all.
*  So it's not lawful to bar someone from the candidacy when, at least in theory, Congress
*  can make you eligible right up to the point of inauguration.
*  In this situation, a ruling from this court that affirms the decision below would not
*  only violate term limits, but take away the votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans.
*  I welcome the court's questions.
*  Okay, so this admittedly is very technical, but there are three things going on here,
*  right?
*  First, Trump's lawyer is saying that this doesn't apply to presidents or former presidents
*  because they're not mentioned specifically in this rule.
*  Secondly, he's saying it doesn't prevent anyone from seeking the office of the presidency
*  because that office isn't specifically mentioned in this rule.
*  And finally, it doesn't say anything about barring people from running for office.
*  It only bars people from holding certain offices.
*  So for all those reasons, Trump's lawyer is saying this doesn't apply to Trump and that
*  the Colorado Supreme Court in its finding has been wrong.
*  That's right.
*  Mr. Murray?
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  And Jason Murray, the lawyer for the six Colorado voters challenging Trump's eligibility, says
*  all of that is wrong.
*  He says Section 3 disqualifies all oath-breaking insurrectionists except a former president
*  who never before held other state or federal office.
*  There is no possible rationale for such an exemption.
*  That it would be an insane way to interpret the constitutional provision to exclude the
*  most important office in the land and the highest executive official of the United States
*  from a provision meant to safeguard democracy from insurrection.
*  Section 3 uses deliberately broad language to cover all positions of federal power requiring
*  an oath to the Constitution.
*  He also makes the point that Section 3 is similar to other kinds of qualifications to
*  be president.
*  States are allowed to safeguard their ballots by excluding those who are underage, foreign
*  born.
*  You have to be 35 years old.
*  You have to be a natural born citizen of the United States.
*  He's saying use your common sense, justices.
*  This does apply to the president.
*  That's pretty clear.
*  Yeah.
*  Under Article 2 and the 10th Amendment, states have the power to ensure that their citizens'
*  electoral votes are not wasted on a candidate who is constitutionally barred from holding
*  office.
*  He says it's a crazy way to run a system that people can vote for Donald Trump and not know
*  whether their vote is going to count depending on whether his current disqualification from
*  running for office is perhaps lifted by Congress and not only by Congress, by a two-thirds
*  vote of each house, which is a little hard to imagine.
*  We are here because for the first time since the War of 1812, our nation's capital came
*  under violent assault.
*  For the first time in history, the attack was incited by a sitting president of the
*  United States to disrupt the peaceful transfer of presidential power.
*  I welcome the court's questions.
*  And how do the justices, Adam, respond to these two clashing claims of this close reading
*  of the 14th Amendment by a lawyer for Trump and a lawyer for the Colorado voters?
*  So at first, it seems like the justices are going to divide along predictable lines with
*  conservative justices like Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito being open to this kind of close
*  textual reading.
*  Mr. Mitchell, stepping back on this, a lot hinges on the difference between in your argument,
*  between the term office and officer.
*  And I guess I'm wondering, what theory do you have from an original understanding or
*  a textualist perspective, why those two terms so closely related would carry such different
*  weight?
*  And some of the liberals seem skeptical of Trump's lawyer's argument.
*  Justice Kagan, for instance, kind of throws up her hand saying,
*  You know, if they had thought about it, what reason would they have given for that rule?
*  And it does seem as though there's no particular reason, and you can think of lots of reasons
*  for the contrary, to say that the only people who have engaged in insurrection who are not
*  disqualified from office are presidents who have not held high office before.
*  Why would that rule exist?
*  Let's be serious here.
*  It can't be that the president is not included in these catch-all, all-encompassing phrases
*  on something so important.
*  And is there any better reason for saying that an insurrectionist cannot hold the whole
*  panoply of offices in the United States, but we're perfectly fine with that insurrectionist
*  being president?
*  I think that's an even tougher argument for us to make.
*  Justice Sotomayor?
*  I just want to pin down your principal argument on Section 3.
*  And Justice Sonia Sotomayor, another liberal, makes the interesting point.
*  Your principal argument is that the president is not an officer of the United States, correct?
*  Yeah, I would say it a little more forcefully than what Your Honor just described.
*  Bit of a gerrymandered rule, isn't it, designed to benefit only your client?
*  That this argument seems to be, as she put it, gerrymandered to favor Donald Trump.
*  I certainly wouldn't call it gerrymandered.
*  That implies nefarious and...
*  You remember that list of offices we discussed?
*  I do.
*  Every other president falls into one of the named offices.
*  Joe Biden was a senator, Bill Clinton was a governor.
*  Donald Trump, though, didn't serve in any previous official government capacity.
*  He was a businessman, and then he became president.
*  Right.
*  Virtually every other president except Washington has taken an oath to support the Constitution,
*  correct?
*  That's right.
*  And with the possible exception of George Washington, every other president fits into
*  one of those other slots.
*  So we have an argument here that's kind of a ticket for one ride only applies only to
*  Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  And sort of by your point is, that's a little too cute by half that you're coming up with
*  an argument that applies to only one of our many presidents.
*  Or perhaps two, but the first one being the first when there really wasn't much of a precedent
*  to think about.
*  That's right.
*  That gives you a sense of how technical, historical, originalist that part of the argument was.
*  Thank you.
*  Justice Jackson?
*  Going back to whether the presidency is one of the barred offices, I guess...
*  And then in a little bit of a surprise, it turns out that not everyone is so predictable.
*  Justice Katanji Brown Jackson, the third liberal, says it might actually make sense to her to
*  exclude the presidency from Section 3.
*  Why?
*  I didn't see any evidence that the presidency was top of mind for the framers when they
*  were drafting Section 3 because they were actually dealing with a different issue.
*  The pressing concern, at least as I see the historical record, was actually what was
*  going on at lower levels of the government.
*  She says the people who adopted it were concerned with the possibility of insurrectionists infiltrating
*  state government and that former Confederates would return to power in the South.
*  Either in local offices or as representatives.
*  But not that the national office, the president elected by the entire nation, would conceivably
*  be a former Confederate.
*  And that's a very different lens.
*  If your concern is trying to make sure that these people don't come back through the state
*  apparatus and control the government in that direction, it seems to me very different than
*  the worry that an insurrectionist will seize control of the entire national government
*  through the presidency.
*  So suddenly it looks like Justice Jackson is also perhaps an originalist, a textualist
*  on this court.
*  Correct.
*  And at her confirmation hearing, she held herself out to be an originalist and many
*  people, particularly on the right, scoffed.
*  But she has in her brief tenure on the court occasionally shown strong originalist impulses.
*  Right.
*  Unexpectedly, that seems to be leading her to bolster an argument from Trump's lawyer
*  here on whether or not this amendment really does apply to Trump.
*  That's right.
*  So in listening to arguments on this first point, the main point pressed by Donald Trump's
*  lawyers, it seemed like there was the beginning of the possibility of a scrambled lineup.
*  And as other issues were discussed in the case, that possibility seemed only to grow.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Adam, right before the break, we covered the first issue in this hearing and the justice's
*  responses were ideologically confusing.
*  As you said, what happens with the second big issue in this hearing?
*  The second question is whether individual states are entitled to disqualify presidential
*  candidates.
*  A state cannot exclude any candidate for federal office from the ballot on account of section
*  three.
*  Jonathan Mitchell, Trump's lawyer, presses this point also.
*  Unless and until Congress enacts implementing legislation allowing it to do so.
*  And says Congress has to act and we can't have one state here and one state there disqualifying
*  candidates.
*  Only Congress can provide the means of enforcing section three.
*  Well, what would such congressional action look like?
*  What is he referring to?
*  You could imagine Congress enacting a law saying here's what rights states do and don't
*  have in making these determinations, just setting some ground rules.
*  But then President Trump's other arguments for reversal ignore the constitutional role
*  of the states.
*  Jason Murray, the lawyer for the Colorado voters, says that's backwards.
*  States are allowed to safeguard their ballots by excluding those who are underage, foreign-born,
*  running for a third presidential term, or as here, those who have engaged in insurrection
*  against the Constitution in violation of their oath.
*  That the Constitution assigns states the substantial role of conducting federal elections.
*  And this is part of that role.
*  It is kind of common knowledge, and we especially learned it in 2020 when President Trump tried
*  to overturn the election results at the state level, that states very much are responsible
*  for elections in this country, even federal elections, even the presidential election.
*  That's right.
*  Okay, so what do the justices think about both of these arguments being made about whether
*  a state like Colorado can try to knock someone like Trump off the ballot?
*  The justices are very wary of giving this power in this context to individual states.
*  I mean, the whole point of the 14th Amendment was to restrict state power, right?
*  Chief Justice Roberts says the whole point of the 14th Amendment, after all, adopted
*  after the Civil War, adopted after states seceded from the Union, was to restrict state
*  power, to augment federal power.
*  So wouldn't that be the last place that you'd look for authorization for the states, including
*  Confederate states, to enforce the presidential election process?
*  He's saying the 14th Amendment is at odds with the very idea of giving states such power.
*  That's right.
*  No, Your Honor.
*  First, we would locate the state's authority to run presidential elections, not in the
*  14th Amendment, but in Article 2.
*  So Jason Murray, the lawyer for the challengers, says that's the wrong way to think about
*  it, that states have authority to run presidential elections.
*  It's not located in the 14th Amendment.
*  It's located in Article 2 of the Constitution.
*  Article 2 gives states this broad power to determine how their electors are selected,
*  and that broad power implies the narrower power to enforce federal constitutional qualifications.
*  Well, but the narrower power, Your Honor...
*  And then Justice Alito?
*  Your Honor, what do you do with the, what I, what seemed to me to be plain consequences
*  of your position?
*  Picks up on another aspect of the question.
*  If Colorado's position is upheld, surely there will be disqualification proceedings on the
*  other side, and some of those will succeed.
*  Some of them...
*  ...saying it could result in kind of the Wild West of voting, where different states would
*  not only use different standards to decide whether Donald Trump was on or off of their
*  ballot, but perhaps knock President Biden off the ballot for supposed insurrectionary
*  crimes of his own.
*  I would expect that a goodly number of states will say, whoever the Democratic candidate
*  is, you're off the ballot, and others, for the Republican candidate, you're off the ballot,
*  and it'll come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential
*  election.
*  That's a pretty daunting consequence.
*  Well, certainly, Your Honor...
*  And having this kind of back-and-forth mayhem would be a recipe for disaster in a democracy.
*  Justice Kagan?
*  Mr. Mary, you talked...
*  You relied on the state's extensive powers under the electors...
*  And then even Justice Kagan says, listen...
*  It's really about that.
*  Like, what's a state doing deciding who gets to... who other citizens get to vote for for
*  president?
*  The practical effect of allowing Colorado to bar Trump from the ballot affects voters
*  in other states.
*  Colorado is not deciding who other states get to vote for for president.
*  It's deciding how to assign its own electors under its Article 2 power.
*  And the Constitution grants them that broad power...
*  Well, but the effect of that is obvious, yes?
*  No, Your Honor, because different states can have...
*  Adam, what do we think Kagan's specific fear is when she argues that letting Colorado take
*  Trump off the ballot will affect other people's voting, she seems to be saying, outside of
*  Colorado?
*  I guess it could mean one of two things or maybe more things.
*  It could mean that it just affects the balance of power across the electoral college and
*  makes it less likely that the candidate, someone in Texas or New Jersey wants to support is
*  going to win because the Colorado votes drop out.
*  It may also mean that if Colorado knocks Trump off the ballot, other states will feel persuaded
*  that they should do the same thing.
*  That said, the lawyer for the voters, Jason Murray, doesn't get it.
*  He says Colorado is not deciding who other states get to vote for for president.
*  It's deciding how to assign its own electors in the electoral college.
*  That's just a function of states' power to preserve their own electors and avoid disenfranchisement
*  of their own citizens.
*  Thank you.
*  And then...
*  What about the idea that we should think about democracy, think about the right of the people
*  to elect candidates of their choice?
*  Justice Kavanaugh also raises his own concerns about disenfranchisement.
*  Does that come in when we think about should we read Section 3 this way or read it that
*  way?
*  What about the background principle, if you agree, of democracy?
*  I'd like to make three points on that, Justice Kavanaugh.
*  The first is that constitutional safeguards are for the purpose of safeguarding our democracy,
*  not just...
*  Jason Murray responds that Section 3 is designed to protect democracy.
*  This case illustrates the danger of refusing to apply Section 3 as written because the
*  reason we're here is that President Trump tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans
*  who voted against him, and the Constitution doesn't require that he be given another chance.
*  Thank you.
*  So you had Murray trying very hard to convince them otherwise, but nonetheless, both Justice
*  Kavanaugh, a conservative, and Justice Kagan, a liberal, seemed to be worried about the
*  potential that a ruling that would knock Donald Trump off the ballot would amount to
*  a kind of disenfranchisement.
*  Right.
*  And when we start to do the math here, it's not just Justice Jackson anymore who is surprising
*  us as a liberal justice skeptical of Colorado's argument for keeping Trump off the ballot.
*  We now have at least two of the liberal justices saying this might not hold up.
*  As the argument goes forward, it seems that there are probably eight justices prepared
*  to keep Trump on the ballot and the only wild card, and it could end up being unanimous,
*  but the only wild card is Justice Sotomayor.
*  Hmm.
*  Adam, if eight justices agree that Trump should be allowed to be on the ballot in Colorado,
*  that would be kind of staggering given the nature of this case.
*  It would also be kind of staggering given the nature of this court.
*  That's right, and this is a court that has been battered and questions have been raised
*  about its legitimacy and authority and prestige, and I think the justices might view this as
*  an opportunity to rebuild, to come together, to find consensus, and particularly in an
*  issue where a contrary ruling, one that would knock a leading presidential candidate off
*  the ballot would give rise to a very tough reaction from half the country.
*  Adam, it's possible, of course, that what you're saying is right, but the justices have
*  done a kind of political analysis here and decided they want to be on the same page,
*  and that page is to let voters have choice, keep Trump on the ballot, but is it also possible
*  that at the end of the day, what many people saw as a strong legal case being presented
*  by the Colorado voters and their lawyer just turned out to be weaker once it got to the
*  highest court in front of the nation's preeminent jurists and started to kind of crumble.
*  Most legal scholars think that the case against Donald Trump is very strong.
*  The court, for various reasons, good faith legal ones, political calculations, concerns
*  about the consequences of a ruling, were always likely to be looking for an exit ramp.
*  It looks like they've found one and that that exit ramp will be embraced by a substantial
*  majority, maybe even all of the justices, but that doesn't undermine the purely theoretical
*  question of does Section 3 apply to Donald Trump's conduct.
*  It is a reflection of kind of a judicial reality of a court that has been under some
*  substantial stress, not wanting to use what political capital it has left on this particular
*  cause.
*  Hmm.
*  Well for those who see what Trump did on January 6th as disqualifying for the presidency, the
*  Colorado effort to keep him off the ballot was very meaningful, and it was in many of
*  their eyes justifiable.
*  And if the Supreme Court rules that Trump can't be held off the ballot, it will have
*  eliminated a major route by which American voters can hold Trump accountable for trying
*  to overturn the results of a free and fair election.
*  Yeah, I don't want to undersell that point at all.
*  If the court rules as I expect it to, it will be a stinging loss for opponents of Donald
*  Trump, who saw what happened on January 6th, who consider it a vile insurrection that he
*  incited and in the face of a constitutional provision that it is child's play to read
*  as applying to him.
*  All of that is true.
*  But of course, this isn't the only Trump case.
*  Trump is the subject of numerous criminal prosecutions, including most notably a federal
*  case arising from some of these same events.
*  And that case will soon be at the Supreme Court, probably next week, in the form of
*  a request from Donald Trump that he be deemed absolutely immune from criminal prosecution
*  for his activities in trying to subvert the 2020 election.
*  And it would not surprise me at all, Michael, if these cases would be decided in tandem
*  and in different ways with a ruling that Trump is eligible to run, but a ruling that he is
*  not immune from prosecution and sending the case back down for trial, even as the election
*  season heats up.
*  And that would give the court the opportunity to look even handed, to give Trump a significant
*  victory and a significant loss and leave it not only to the political process, but the
*  ordinary criminal judicial process to decide whether Donald Trump can be held accountable
*  for his January 6 related activities.
*  Well, Adam, thank you very much.
*  We appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The special counsel investigating President Biden's handling of classified materials
*  will not seek to prosecute him, but said there was evidence that Biden willfully retained
*  and disclosed some sensitive material.
*  In a report released on Thursday, the special counsel said that when Biden left the White
*  House after his vice presidency in 2017, he took classified documents about Afghanistan
*  and notebooks with handwritten entries that referred to sensitive intelligence.
*  But in an unflattering assessment, the special counsel, Robert Herr, said that a jury would
*  be unlikely to find Biden guilty of a crime because of his poor memory.
*  Herr said that Biden could not remember key dates such as when his vice presidency ended
*  and when his eldest son, Bo, had died.
*  My memory is not good.
*  My memory is fine.
*  During a news conference a few hours later, Biden angrily rejected the claim that his
*  memory was in decline.
*  Take a look at what I've done since I've become president.
*  None of you thought I could pass any of the things I got passed.
*  How did that happen?
*  You know, I guess I just forgot what was going on.
