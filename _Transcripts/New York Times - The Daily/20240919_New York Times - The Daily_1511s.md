# The Day Thousands of Pagers Exploded in Lebanon
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU94A1vTpDk)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Today, inside Israel's audacious and deadly plot to blow up thousands of electronic devices
*  across Lebanon.
*  My colleague, Patrick Kingsley, on what it accomplished and at what cost.
*  It's Thursday, September 19th.
*  So Patrick, you've been reporting on these remarkable series of attacks across Lebanon
*  over the past two days.
*  Tell me what happened.
*  Well, at around 3.30 p.m. local time on Tuesday afternoon, suddenly there were hundreds, if
*  not thousands, of explosions across the country of Lebanon.
*  There was a man who seemed to blow up next to a fruit stall in a market.
*  There was someone else who seemed to blow up in smoke at the checkout counter at a supermarket.
*  And there was a man who was hit while he was on a motorcycle in heavy traffic.
*  And basically what had happened was that the pages of hundreds, if not thousands, of operatives
*  from the Lebanese militia Hezbollah exploded almost all at once.
*  It set off chaos across Lebanon in the capital Beirut, in eastern Lebanon, in southern Lebanon.
*  Hundreds of ambulances were called into action, ferrying people suddenly to hospitals.
*  The hospitals themselves were pandemonium.
*  There were people coming in blinded.
*  There were people coming in with maimed torsos, maimed groin areas, wherever they had been
*  holding their pages on their bodies.
*  There was a general sense of terror and fear spreading across Lebanese society as they
*  realized that an everyday item such as a pager was able to explode in public spaces like
*  shops, markets, and even traffic jams.
*  Okay, so there was pandemonium throughout Lebanese society.
*  What do we know about who was behind the attack?
*  We know from our teams reporting that the attack was mounted by some part of the Israeli
*  military.
*  Israel is locked in a years-long conflict with Hezbollah that escalated after Hamas
*  attacked Israel on October 7th.
*  At that point, Hezbollah started firing on Israel in solidarity with Hamas.
*  And since then, Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging missile and rocket fire all
*  along the Israel-Lebanon border.
*  Hezbollah is not a state actor, it's a militia, but it is the most powerful armed group in
*  Lebanon, and probably the most powerful non-state actor across the Middle East.
*  And it has what amounts to a standing army.
*  That army has been exchanging fire with the Israeli military for nearly a year now.
*  And this appeared to be the latest salvo in that conflict.
*  Right, very important border there to the north, and one that you and I, Patrick, have
*  done a number of episodes questioning whether the conflict there, that is of course kind
*  of in some ways secondary to the conflict in Gaza, might spill over into something bigger.
*  So an area that has seen increasing conflict.
*  Why pagers though?
*  Why are Hezbollah guys walking around with pagers?
*  You would think that they would use cell phones like everyone else in 2024.
*  But Hezbollah has realized that Israel is able to hack cell phones, intercept cell phone
*  messages and derive a huge amount of information about Hezbollah from those intercepts.
*  And to try and blunt that Israeli intelligence threat, they seem to have switched to pagers,
*  this very lo-fi old technology, basic technology, to prevent Israel from hacking their communications
*  and their devices.
*  Instead, the opposite happened.
*  Israel still managed to hack the pages, not only to intercept messages, but to turn those
*  pages into explosive devices.
*  How did they manage to pull it off?
*  What did they actually do?
*  We understand from the reporting of our colleagues Ronen Bergman and Shira Frenkel, that at some
*  point in the creation or transportation of these pages to Lebanon, Israeli operatives
*  placed within those pages several grams of explosives and a mechanism that would allow
*  to be activated on the receipt of a particular message.
*  And what seems to have happened at 3.30 on Tuesday afternoon is that a message was sent
*  to hundreds, if not thousands of these pages.
*  The pages beeped for several seconds, attracting the attention of their owners who in some
*  cases seem to have taken them out to look at the pages to see what message was coming
*  in.
*  At some point, the pages exploded, killing some people, maiming thousands of others.
*  And how did Israel actually get to the pages themselves?
*  We don't have the full picture here.
*  What we do know is that the pages were made in the name of a Taiwanese company.
*  That Taiwanese company has said it was not actually involved in the making of these particular
*  pages and in fact it was subcontracted to a company based in Hungary.
*  The Hungarian government has said the pages were not made within Hungary itself.
*  And so there's a lot of uncertainty about who exactly made these pages and at what point
*  they might have been intercepted during their manufacture or during the supply chain process.
*  And as those questions were starting to be asked and in some cases answered, the story
*  got even more complicated.
*  A second set of explosions hit across Lebanon on Wednesday.
*  The crowds had just gathered for the funeral and we heard a loud boom.
*  And these were not exploding pages, but other kinds of communication devices including two-way
*  radios.
*  These explosions of the walkie-talkies seem to have been bigger explosions with perhaps
*  more explosives hidden within the devices.
*  And those again sent a wave of horror and terror across Lebanon, raising fears that
*  any device might now be a target and making people wary of even their telephones and their
*  personal computers.
*  And Patrick, between these two attacks, what was the total death toll?
*  At least 12 people were killed in the pager attacks on Tuesday.
*  And as of very early Thursday, at least 20 people were killed in the second round of
*  explosions on Wednesday.
*  And more than 3,000 people were injured across both days.
*  Hezbollah had not yet announced whether any of the people killed in the second round were
*  its own members.
*  But on Tuesday, they said that 8 of 12 killed were from its own ranks.
*  And we know from the Lebanese authorities that two of those 12 were children.
*  And also the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon appears to have been seriously injured in
*  one of the attacks, Iran being Hezbollah's biggest benefactor.
*  So even the Iranian ambassador had a Hezbollah pager.
*  I don't think we quite know whether he had the pager or maybe he was with someone who
*  had one.
*  But certainly he was in proximity of one of these pages.
*  Patrick, with that in mind, I'm wondering how we should think about this attack.
*  Because on the one hand, it was very precise, really aimed directly at these Hezbollah operatives.
*  But on the other hand, it feels like it really stepped over the line into daily life in Lebanon.
*  These children, a medic, just the fact that these explosions were going off in such public
*  places.
*  What are people saying about this attack?
*  You've summarized the debate about this attack perfectly.
*  On the one hand, you have Israelis and their supporters hailing what they see as a remarkably
*  and ingenious and sophisticated attack that has pinpointed the whereabouts of specific
*  militants from Hezbollah and managed to take them out in hundreds of locations across Lebanon.
*  Yes, in public places, but with small enough explosives that the people that were mainly
*  harmed by these attacks were the Hezbollah militants themselves.
*  Even though these attacks caused so much fear and spilled so much blood in Lebanon, to Israelis,
*  this was a much more discriminant attack than the kind of rocket fire that has been sent
*  into Israeli territory nearly every day for the past 11 or 12 months, even killing a group
*  of schoolchildren as they played football in a town one weekend in the Golan Heights.
*  On the other hand, critics are saying that this was, in fact, not a very precise and
*  well-weighted attack, but almost an indiscriminate assault on thousands of places across civilian
*  life throughout Lebanon.
*  These may have been Hezbollah operatives, but they were not conducting military activity
*  at the time in which they were hit.
*  Some of them were in shops, some of them were in markets, some of them were in the street.
*  By targeting these people in such public places, Israel, according to these critics at least,
*  was enacting some kind of state-sponsored terrorism that has sent fears throughout Lebanese
*  society and prompted Lebanese citizens to wonder whether their device, their phone,
*  their computer could be the next thing to be struck.
*  Okay, so a range of views.
*  But whatever you think of this attack, it is clear that it's a major escalation and
*  a real ratcheting up of the conflict on this very important border between Lebanon and
*  Israel, which makes me wonder what Israel was trying to achieve here.
*  Well, in the short term, it's quite clear what they were up to.
*  They are trying to project strength, they're trying to deter an enemy that has been firing
*  missiles into Israeli communities since October.
*  But in the long term, it's a bit of a mystery.
*  And both Israeli officials and Israeli analysts I've been speaking to in the last 24 hours
*  don't really understand what the strategic goal is right now.
*  They understand what the short-term benefits are, but what comes next, what Israel wants
*  to happen next, is unclear.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, you said in the short term, it's clear what Israel's up to here, but in the
*  long term, it's really a mystery.
*  Let's take this just a bit at a time.
*  So walk me through the short-term goal for Israel.
*  Well, in the short term, it clearly deals a blow to one of its biggest enemies, an enemy
*  that it's been fighting for nearly a year now.
*  It incapacitates thousands of Hezbollah operatives.
*  It sends a message of strength that instills fear and conceivably it makes people wary
*  about using any kind of electronics if this is what Israel has the capacity to do to something
*  as obscure as the pager.
*  It also, to some extent, restores the prestige of Israel's fabled intelligence agencies
*  that have long been revered and feared for their clandestine operations, but which really
*  took a blow to their reputations after the October 7th attack on Israel that Israel's
*  intelligence agencies, its spies, its military failed to either predict in full or to prepare
*  properly for.
*  So an attack that is as intricate as blowing up hundreds, if not thousands of pages simultaneously
*  in a foreign country goes some way to restoring their aura in the eyes of both friends and
*  foes.
*  Okay, but what about the longer term, though?
*  We know that Hezbollah has said that it will keep fighting Israel until there's a ceasefire
*  in Gaza, which of course at this point seems to be a very long way off.
*  So from Israel's perspective, how does this attack factor into its strategy to get Hezbollah
*  to stop?
*  Well, for months, the hope was that the fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border would end
*  if the fighting in Gaza also ended.
*  And that creates a bigger problem day by day for Israel because the war in Gaza shows no
*  sign of ending.
*  The negotiations for a truce in Gaza have reached a deadlock.
*  It doesn't seem like we are going to see a ceasefire there between Hamas and Israel for
*  weeks if not months.
*  And as a result, then the war between Hezbollah and Israel is also likely to continue for
*  weeks if not months.
*  So to try and shift the needle and to disconnect Hezbollah's fight from Hamas and to disconnect
*  the fate of Lebanon from that of Gaza, Israel appears to have mounted these explosions of
*  pages and other communications devices on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*  The hope is that all of that will cow Hezbollah enough that they will stand down, that they
*  will stop linking their fight to Hamas's fight and agree to some kind of ceasefire,
*  even as the war in Gaza continues.
*  And Patrick, is that realistic?
*  Like is that going to work?
*  That's the big question.
*  Israel has tried all sorts of small escalations in recent months.
*  It even assassinated the top military figure within Hezbollah, Fuad Shokr, earlier on this
*  year.
*  That did not deter Hezbollah.
*  So what experts are saying is that Hezbollah is unlikely to be deterred by this latest
*  attack also.
*  And in fact, there's a risk that it may be even more energized and even more motivated
*  to maintain its battle with Israel, precisely because Israel's infiltration of its communications
*  networks was so brazen and so embarrassing to Hezbollah.
*  This was a humiliation, the idea that so many devices were intercepted and hacked and poisoned,
*  as it were, by explosives.
*  It was a catastrophe for Hezbollah's own sense of strength and its own aura.
*  And people that follow the group say that it's unlikely that they will be able to capitulate
*  in the aftermath of something like that, and that their only option is to continue fighting
*  this low intensity border war or even to escalate.
*  And that that in turn will prompt Israel to hit back harder, and then we will have the
*  all out war between Hezbollah and Israel that people have been fearing for months or all
*  the way back to October.
*  Right.
*  Hezbollah has many, many thousands of fighters.
*  So though more than 3,000 may have been maimed, there are many, many more.
*  And Hezbollah is probably very angry right now.
*  As you're saying, it was a humiliation.
*  And I guess my question, Patrick, is, you know, surely Israel knows that.
*  So I wonder whether there's any world in which this was kind of an intentional act by Israel
*  to try to draw Hezbollah into a wider war.
*  That's certainly one assessment that's been made by some people who follow this conflict
*  closely, that this was a provocation designed to get Hezbollah to react strongly and then
*  give Israel a pretext to react even stronger still or even to invade southern Lebanon.
*  The problem with that argument is if that genuinely is Israel's strategic intention,
*  why did the Israeli military not immediately follow its explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday
*  with an invasion?
*  That would have been the perfect time to invade when Hezbollah was in shock.
*  It was in disarray.
*  Many of its fighters were in hospital.
*  were trying to figure out what was going on.
*  That would have been the moment to escalate to all out war.
*  That said, there has been a rise in rhetoric from Israeli leaders in recent days.
*  The defense minister, Yav Galant, has talked about a military solution being perhaps the
*  only solution to the conflict.
*  He also said the war is entering a new phase.
*  The trouble for people like me and others that have to analyze these kind of statements
*  is that it's clear nevertheless that these Israeli leaders are still keeping themselves
*  one or two steps away from saying without equivocation that they are going to enter
*  into some kind of all out war or even invade Lebanon.
*  It still feels like Israel is leaving the door open to some kind of mediation, some
*  kind of diplomatic negotiation.
*  I guess, Patrick, these two days and the attacks of these two days really do feel like they
*  pitch us into a new, more dangerous place.
*  I wonder what you are going to be looking for in the days and weeks ahead to help answer
*  some of these questions.
*  Well, in the immediate sense, we're looking at Israeli troop movements.
*  Will they send more troops to the north?
*  We're looking at Israeli rhetoric.
*  We're also looking at a speech that is set to take place at five o'clock local time on
*  Thursday afternoon from the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.
*  We'll be keeping a close eye to see whether he himself announces an escalation to see
*  whether he takes a more conciliatory or ambiguous stance.
*  We'll also be monitoring all the shuttle diplomacy that's set to take place between Israel and
*  Lebanon in the coming days.
*  And we will also be keeping an eye out for yet more surprises.
*  Yeah, because who would have ever thought that something like this would happen?
*  No one outside of Israeli intelligence circles could have predicted that yesterday thousands
*  of pages would explode suddenly in the middle of the Lebanese day.
*  Patrick, it is now 1230 a.m. for you, and I really appreciate your time.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  Good night.
*  Good night.
*  On Wednesday night, The Times reported that the Hungarian company subcontracted to make
*  the pagers was in fact a series of Israeli shell companies and that the pagers had been
*  made by Israeli intelligence officers.
*  The first batch of booby-trapped pagers shipped to Lebanon in 2022 and production ramped up
*  when Hezbollah leadership told operatives to forgo their phones.
*  In Israel, intelligence officers referred to the pagers as, quote, buttons that could
*  be pushed when the time seemed ripe.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, our patient approach over the past year has paid dividends.
*  Inflation is now much closer to our objective, and we have gained greater confidence that
*  inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.
*  The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point, an unusually large
*  move and a clear signal that central bankers think they are winning their war against inflation.
*  The Fed's decision lowers rates to about 4.9% down from a more than two-decade high.
*  The cut is meant to prevent the economy from slowing so much that the job market begins
*  to weaken significantly.
*  So far, Fed officials have managed to slow inflation without causing major economic problems.
*  For the White House, the Fed's announcement was encouraging and signaled that after years
*  of rapid price increases, a return to normal inflation was in sight.
*  But Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump accused the Fed of playing politics
*  by cutting interest rates, which ultimately helps consumers so close to the election.
