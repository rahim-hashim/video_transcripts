# Inside The Fall Of Syria’s Brutal Dictator
**New York Times Podcasts:** [December 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF7eYOqn4oc)
*  My name is Road Dandashi, I'm 26 years old, I'm currently in Homs, Syria.
*  There are so many people on the streets, probably all of Syria, I'm not even exaggerating.
*  Everyone's celebrating, they're singing, they're taking pictures, they're taking videos.
*  What you're hearing right now are not bullets, actually they're just more like fireworks.
*  People are just shocked that we actually got rid of the brutal government that we were under.
*  There is just this peaceful feeling that you get that it's okay, this is over, it's over.
*  It's the end of a 50-year-old oppression that tortured us, that took away loved ones from us.
*  We're all afraid that if we sleep, this might be a dream. Is this a dream?
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Syria has been controlled by one family for more than half a century.
*  It ruled by repression, devastation, and violence.
*  But about two weeks ago, the regime began to falter.
*  And then, over the course of one stunning night, it collapsed.
*  Today, my colleague Carlotta Gall, on the fall of Bashar al-Assad, and what comes next?
*  It's Monday, December 9th.
*  So Carlotta, there's been an absolutely incredible turn of events in Syria.
*  We're talking on Sunday morning. Walk us through what happened.
*  It has been the most incredible turn of events.
*  In just 12 days, we've turned from what we thought was really a frozen conflict going nowhere to an uprising in this 13-year civil war.
*  Armed groups in Syria have reportedly attacked government forces in the western country side of Aleppo province.
*  It started with a small rebel group come up from the northwest of the country.
*  And very rapidly, in just a matter of days, they took three cities.
*  The Syrian army concedes it has lost control of large parts of Aleppo.
*  Aleppo in the north, the second biggest city in the country.
*  And then they started to move south.
*  Islamist forces are on their fourth day of a lightning offensive through several towns and villages towards Syria's fourth largest city, Hama.
*  And then they kept going.
*  Opposition fighters now on their way going south towards Homs, that then leads to the capital, Damascus.
*  This is when suddenly it seemed that they were ambitious enough to actually topple the government.
*  And so by Friday, we knew that the capital was in danger.
*  And Saturday, you saw reports of gunfire in the city.
*  Syrian rebels are telling media outlets they've entered the capital city of Damascus.
*  Then you saw these reports of the army leaving, abandoning the airport, some of them abandoning their uniforms on the roads.
*  And then overnight, Saturday night, suddenly in a rush.
*  With the help of God, the city of Damascus was liberated and the regime of the tyrant Bashar al-Assad was toppled.
*  The rebels took the state TV and they announced that they'd taken control of the whole of the capital.
*  And the president, Bashar al-Assad, had got on a plane and left the country.
*  Long live free Syria.
*  So it's really an incredibly swift movement of events from a total dictatorship to he's gone.
*  I mean, it was just unbelievable, really, like that this country suddenly was leaderless.
*  Yes, and Syria has had the same leaders, the same family of leaders for 50 years, a very authoritarian family.
*  Bashar al-Assad has been in power now, but his father was in power before him.
*  And so they've ruled this country with an iron grip since the 1970s.
*  So it's really a big deal.
*  It is a big deal. And I want to unpack it with you.
*  So how did this forever regime in Syria suddenly, shockingly, just disappear overnight?
*  Where should we start to explain that?
*  Well, this is the culmination of the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 when different countries started to rise up against the dictatorships.
*  We saw it in Tunisia and we saw it in Egypt and we saw it in Libya.
*  And Syria joined that run of protests, people daring to come out onto the streets asking for freedom, for democracy, for human rights, dignity.
*  And Syria was the same as the others.
*  But what happened in Syria was the government of Syria under Assad really cracked down, used violence against the protesters,
*  but then did mass arrests, interrogations, torture, disappearances, a lot of executions.
*  And then some of the protesters took up weapons and it became an armed insurgency and a civil war.
*  Essentially, the country was fighting each other.
*  And then this sparked the introduction of really radical extremist jihadist groups.
*  The most well-known and largest was Islamic State.
*  It got very, very brutal in Syria.
*  It has a brutal past, but this was something on a different scale.
*  And then Assad doubled down.
*  He gassed civilians in some of the war to take control back of some of the cities.
*  And then millions were displaced, fleeing the country, fleeing a lot into Turkey and Lebanon and neighboring countries and heading for Europe or anywhere they could.
*  It was really a most ghastly civil war.
*  And by 2014, hundreds of thousands had been killed and wounded.
*  At this point, who is winning that war?
*  Well, that's the interesting thing.
*  Assad, for all his brutal repression, is actually barely hanging on.
*  And that's when we started to see other countries that have stakes in Syria start to get involved.
*  Right. Okay. So that is also when Syria starts to get really complicated.
*  So lay that out for me, Carlotta. What starts to happen?
*  Yes. So ISIS was a huge concern, especially for the West.
*  They were already in Iraq and they were expanding their territory and they were recruiting massively.
*  So that's when in 2014, American troops entered the fray, particularly to fight ISIS and to repress this very, very virulent jihadist group that was obviously interested in attacking Western countries.
*  And so what happened next? Who's the next big player that comes on the scene?
*  So there were actually two big players that came in the scene and they came in on the side of Assad.
*  That was Russia and Iran.
*  And Russia came in in a very big way with serious firepower, planes, jets, fighter bombers, weaponry and a lot of advice and tactics.
*  And they brought ships into the ports and so on.
*  And then Iran had the foot soldiers on the ground.
*  There were a lot of them who came in from Iran, but they also had Hezbollah, very experienced, very accomplished fighters who came in from Lebanon.
*  And the Iranians sent in advisors and military advisors who ran the campaign.
*  So they really did a great amount of actually retaking territory for the Assad regime.
*  And why do Iran and Russia enter the war like that?
*  So they, for both Iran and Russia, it was very important to see the Assad regime survive.
*  Russia had long had relations with Syria, going back right through the communist times.
*  And so they wanted to be able to keep their access to the Mediterranean, their trade, their diplomatic influence.
*  And Iran had an equally important reason to be involved.
*  They couched it in religious terms, but it was very clearly a geopolitical desire to have good relations with Syria and influence,
*  but also to have a very important land bridge through Syria to their allies, Hezbollah, the militia in Lebanon.
*  So for those reasons, they also wanted to see Assad survive.
*  So bottom line, Syria becomes this kind of cauldron of geopolitical rivalries.
*  Absolutely. And those two powers, Iran and Russia, are propping up Assad.
*  He's in power, but he's got all these rebel groups around the country pushed to the edges.
*  And it's since 2016, it's been like locked.
*  So how do we get from that deadlocked civil war to the rapid toppling of Assad that everybody just watched unfold?
*  So the biggest change, of course, was the two main backers of Assad, Russia and Iran, became massively distracted by other events and weakened.
*  It was the wars in other countries that caused this.
*  Russia is engaged in a really tough war in Ukraine, and they've had to move troops out of Syria to ploy them in Ukraine.
*  They've expended all their efforts and men and money and weapons on that war.
*  And then the second war is obviously Israel's fight, first in Gaza, but then in Lebanon against Hezbollah and the attacks that Israel has meted out on Iran in Syria.
*  They've done a large number of airstrikes on Iranian elements,
*  but also particularly Hezbollah, who had been the foot soldiers for Iran to help Assad's Syrian army, they were really hit hard in the recent months.
*  And that was very debilitating for the Iranian effort to shore up Assad.
*  And so the moment those things were happening, the Syrian rebels were obviously watching and noticing.
*  They could see that the resistance was weak, that Russia and Iran were distracted and struggling, in fact, in both their wars.
*  And that's when they pounced.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So who are these rebel forces who just toppled Assad? Tell me about them.
*  So they're a hodgepodge of lots of different groups, but the main mover and the main group behind this offensive is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.
*  It's called HTS for short in the West. Its name means the Organization for the Liberation of Syria or of the Levant.
*  It's a very Islamic, very strict actually organization, comes from the jihadi tradition, and it's designated by many countries in the West and the United States as a terror group.
*  And who leads it? Who's in charge?
*  It's led by a Saudi-born Syrian. He's in his 40s. He's called Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. That's his Nonde Gehr, his chosen name for the war.
*  He lived in Saudi, then he grew up in his teens in Syria. He was a student when he then left to join the fight against America in Iraq.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And he joined Al-Qaeda. And then he got arrested by the US forces in Iraq.
*  And he spent several years in Bukkah jail, which is a famous prison camp where a lot of the Al-Qaeda and Islamist militias were detained and kept.
*  And of course, it became a great meeting place for them all because they were all in there together for many years. So that is his history.
*  That's really interesting because it probably means he had some pretty serious jihadist credentials. But he clearly got out of prison. What did he do next?
*  What we know is that he eventually returned to Syria and he set up an Al-Qaeda affiliated group at the beginning of the civil war.
*  And then he was among the groups that were gradually pushed back as the Russians and the Iranians helped the Assad government take control.
*  The rebels were pushed back into the northwestern corner of Syria in Idlib province. And that's where he ended up in 2016.
*  And then something really interesting happened. They're down and out. They're under bombardment. They've really got their backs to the wall.
*  And he, as a leader of his group, he starts reforming. He changes the name of his group and then gradually he breaks from Al-Qaeda and he turns himself into a Syrian nationalist leader.
*  And it's been a steady thing since then, over the last eight years. And we're all watching to see, is it a big PR push or is it really serious?
*  Yeah, that's what I want to know. I mean, can one be former Al-Qaeda? Like, how does that even work?
*  Well, I think it is interesting. In Syria, I think, you know, I followed jihadi groups all over the world and a lot of them, they talk tough talk for several reasons.
*  To look strong and to look aggressive, but also because they think it ticks some boxes where they can get support and financing and so on.
*  And I think the Syrian groups were just the same. I've never met Jolani, but I've asked many people who have met him.
*  And some will say he's a diehard. Others say he's more pragmatic. And I actually went four years ago on an embed with HTS to their stronghold in Idlib.
*  Wait, Claudia, you went on an embed with HTS?
*  I did several times, in fact, because there were some things they decided they needed to tell the Western world.
*  So they invited journalists like me. I was based in Istanbul to come and see.
*  And the trip includes always a long lunch and a sort of long political discussion.
*  I mean, it's not quite a long diatribe, but where they explain what they're about and what they believe in.
*  So what was it like there, Carlotta?
*  They are super Islamic and you could feel they are authoritarian. They controlled everything. They control where we went.
*  We could talk to whoever we want, but they were very cautious to be in charge.
*  And of course, between the lines, we could understand that these guys rule it, but they are of their society.
*  There's not much freedom of speech, certainly in the media, but there were other things that I think people felt they were running quite a good ship.
*  And how were they for women? How was life for women there? Often an indicator with Islamic regimes.
*  To tell you the truth, when you go to Idlib, most people are destitute.
*  So quite frankly, they won't talk to you about Islamist rules. They'll talk to you about they haven't got enough food for their kids.
*  But we did reporting on some of the women who felt very threatened by this group and felt they had to leave.
*  There are people who were arrested. There were people who were beaten. There's possibly some people who were disappeared.
*  So it's a pretty ruthless group who were set at first on gaining complete control.
*  And now they're trying to reform themselves and appear softer.
*  But their first years, when they were establishing control, they were pretty ruthless.
*  So it sounds like not quite Taliban like, but some hard edges.
*  Yes, I would say that exactly that.
*  So in other words, very unclear what this group could mean for the future of Syria or even really if it's going to be the future of Syria.
*  Absolutely. It's very fluid. We know that Assad has left the country and we've seen that Jalani has arrived in Damascus.
*  He's made a statement to the nation. He's called on his troops to behave, not to pursue people, not to destroy things.
*  But I think it's very clear that for him, this is the liberation from the Assad regime that was the main aim.
*  And he's achieved that. So now what does he do next?
*  There are a lot of different groups. They're sort of under an umbrella of his.
*  But of course, you know, in these sort of events, you often see different groups turning on each other for power.
*  So that's the $64 million question of what happens further.
*  But he does seem to be someone who has the sternness and the charisma, possibly, to manage that.
*  But we'll have to see. And he's really not been out there a lot all these years.
*  He hasn't done a lot of interviews. So we don't even know how much the Syrians will like him and accept him.
*  So everything's up in the air at the moment.
*  So that's Jalani. But of course, there's this geopolitical earthquake that this is causing, right?
*  That is happening at the same time.
*  Absolutely. And this is a very powerful, important country in the Middle East, a crucial place on the map, if you look at it.
*  All the countries around are going to be deeply concerned and want to influence.
*  You've got Turkey and the North involved already with troops inside Syria.
*  You've got Iran, of course, hurting and pushed out, but already saying it wants a role in Syria in the future.
*  And then you've got Israel actually taking action just this morning.
*  We learned that they've moved in troops and taken control of a buffer zone on its border with Syria.
*  And then Russia is also saying it still wants a role, although that remains to be seen if the Jihadis would accept that.
*  And then, of course, the United States, which has 900 troops still in Syria and has made some strikes just to remind opponents not to come and attack them.
*  So it's a huge, as we mentioned before, a huge cauldron of geopolitical rivalries.
*  And that's going to be something to try and work out and decipher in the coming days and weeks.
*  It's like all of the cards have just been thrown up into the air.
*  I think you're right. Yeah. And that's also for the Arab world.
*  So interesting and important because they were steadily moving towards acceptance of Assad staying in power.
*  And now that's been completely turned upside down.
*  Carlotta, I want to just pause for a moment and think about what just happened from the perspective of Syrians.
*  I mean, as we said, this place has literally been under this regime for about half a century.
*  That's just changed. That's an incredible moment for the Syrian people.
*  It's like an entire country just suddenly gets to wake up from this long sleep or something.
*  And I would guess that while that is potentially hopeful, it's also a really perilous moment because, as you and I both know, when dictators collapse, violence and chaos can ensue.
*  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, for me and for a lot of the Syrians I've been talking to the last week and a half, it's the sense of liberation, the relief, the excitement.
*  And the most compelling has been the release of people from prisons all over the country.
*  There have been extraordinary scenes of people staggering out and some of them barely able to walk but so happy.
*  And some of them have been in prison for more than a decade, including children who've been imprisoned with their mothers.
*  So that's a huge release for the entire country. And that's why they're all celebrating on the streets at the moment.
*  But of course, the Syrians are saying this is a great relief lifted, but we're also very fearful.
*  I think for Syrians, you know, we've had 400,000 people die in this 13-year civil war.
*  14 million people left the country as refugees abroad.
*  And the fear, of course, is everyone that it's going to go back to that or more or different ethnic groups, God forbid, start fighting each other,
*  whether it's for power in a city or in a whole region or over oil fields or wealth.
*  So that's what the Syrians fear. They're telling me we're celebrating today, but just for one day, then we're very worried.
*  So we have to see what goes forward. And we don't know what's going to come next.
*  Carlotta, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  On Sunday night, President Assad surfaced in Russia.
*  Russian state media said that Assad and his family had been granted political asylum there.
*  Meanwhile, the U.S. military carried out one of the largest series of airstrikes in Syria in months,
*  saying that it would not allow ISIS to take advantage of the collapse of government there to regroup.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  In his first sit down broadcast network interview since winning re-election,
*  President-elect Donald Trump outlined an aggressive plan for the early days of his second term.
*  You promised to end birthright citizenship on day one. Is that still your plan?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Speaking on Meet the Press on NBC, he said he would try to end automatic citizenship for children of immigrants.
*  We maybe have to go back to the people, but we have to end it.
*  And he said he would pardon supporters who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021.
*  First day. First day. First day. Yeah, I'm looking first day.
*  These people have been there, how long is it? Three or four years.
*  He said that members of Congress who investigated his role in that attack on the Capitol, like Republican Liz Cheney, should be put in jail.
*  He said he would not direct his new attorney general or FBI director to pursue the matter,
*  but indicated that he expected them to do it on their own.
