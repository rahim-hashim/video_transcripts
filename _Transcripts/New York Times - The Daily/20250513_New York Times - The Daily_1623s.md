# The Secret Power of Siblings
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=4.42s)]
*  Much of our understanding of what makes us who we are revolves around the role of our [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=14.22s)]
*  parents. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=20.66s)]
*  Today, my colleague, Susan Dominus, on the unseen but surprisingly powerful ways that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=22.82s)]
*  our lives are shaped by our siblings. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=30.46s)]
*  It's Tuesday, May 13th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=45.660000000000004s)]
*  Hi Sue. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=52.26s)]
*  Hi Michael. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=53.26s)]
*  It is really nice to see you. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=54.26s)]
*  It's so nice to see you too. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=56.019999999999996s)]
*  I want to jump in and I want to have you tell the story of how it is you became so interested [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=58.019999999999996s)]
*  in the subject of siblings. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=64.86s)]
*  So I think it started when I was a young child and my parents used to go away pretty often [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=68.86s)]
*  and travel for work. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=75.94s)]
*  And when they did, I would stay with really close family friends. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=78.94s)]
*  And you may know that when you stay with a family, you really get to know them and their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=82.94s)]
*  culture in a way that's different from your own family. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=86.94s)]
*  You can really see all these big differences. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=89.94s)]
*  In one family I stayed with, the kids would do these very elaborate math problems like [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=91.94s)]
*  at the table, you know. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=95.94s)]
*  At the dinner table? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=97.94s)]
*  At the dinner table. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=98.94s)]
*  One, the father would say, so Daniel, a plane is leaving Chicago traveling this many miles [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=99.94s)]
*  an hour and another one is leaving New York. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=104.94s)]
*  What time would they cross paths in wherever? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=107.94s)]
*  Oh my God, what are you thinking when that question comes across the table? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=109.94s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=112.94s)]
*  It was like a show for me. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=113.94s)]
*  I just loved it until they asked me that question one day and I burst into tears. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=114.94s)]
*  Is it safe to say that was not the dinner table dynamic at your house? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=117.94s)]
*  No. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=121.94s)]
*  My father is very proud of the one rule we had at the table which was that you had to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=122.94s)]
*  chew with your mouth closed. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=125.94s)]
*  And that was firmly enforced. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=126.94s)]
*  But I became what I think of as kind of a familyologist. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=129.94s)]
*  I got very interested in how family cultures differed and how it affected the kids in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=133.94s)]
*  those families and their outcomes and who they were likely to become. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=137.94s)]
*  And fast forward, I become a journalist. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=141.94s)]
*  Perhaps not surprisingly, a lot of what I cover as a now adult familyologist is family [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=144.94s)]
*  dynamics. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=149.94s)]
*  I do a lot of reporting that involves twins and nature and nurture. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=150.94s)]
*  And I really got interested in doing even more research into this topic. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=154.94s)]
*  I ended up undertaking a book which was going to be about the nature of families of high-achieving [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=157.94s)]
*  siblings. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=163.94s)]
*  And I went into the book fully expecting that I was going to hear these stories about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=164.94s)]
*  parents who had these extraordinary ways of doing things and they inspired and motivated [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=168.94s)]
*  their kids. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=172.94s)]
*  And instead what I found was that although parents matter certainly, the parenting effect [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=173.94s)]
*  is actually probably smaller than we think. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=178.94s)]
*  These decisions that loving parents really agonize over, like whether to have a chore [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=181.94s)]
*  wheel or whether to co-sleep, those things probably matter less than we think. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=186.94s)]
*  And what I found as I reported and researched was that sibling effects are actually more [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=191.94s)]
*  profound than have been realized. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=196.94s)]
*  And they really do matter for kids in ways that I think researchers are just only now [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=198.94s)]
*  starting to appreciate. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=203.94s)]
*  So tell us what you end up concluding about the sibling effect from your book, The Family [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=204.94s)]
*  Dynamic, which ends up very much being a study of the dynamics of siblings. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=212.94s)]
*  Well, I think that there is a kind of duality to how these things work. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=218.94s)]
*  And what I really found is that the parents sort of, the way I think of it is, parents [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=222.94s)]
*  can kind of launch this arrow of ambition and striving into the air. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=227.94s)]
*  But the people who focus that arrow and who help it land somewhere, maybe someplace suitable, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=232.94s)]
*  very often those are the siblings. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=239.94s)]
*  That's a lovely metaphor. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=241.94s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=242.94s)]
*  I wonder if you can illustrate how it actually works that siblings influence the direction [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=243.94s)]
*  of that arrow. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=250.94s)]
*  Yeah, I was curious about that myself. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=251.94s)]
*  How did that work? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=252.94s)]
*  And one way that I got at it was by going deep with a couple of families and really [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=253.94s)]
*  spending time with them, really understanding the sibling dynamics and how they recalled [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=258.94s)]
*  their childhoods and these really influential moments. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=263.94s)]
*  So one of the families that let me into their lives was the Groff family. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=266.94s)]
*  This is a family of three siblings. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=270.94s)]
*  Lauren Groff is this much lauded influential novelist. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=272.94s)]
*  Her sister, Sarah True, is an Olympic triathlete turned Ironman champion. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=276.94s)]
*  I know. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=282.94s)]
*  And then they have a third sibling who they also know. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=283.94s)]
*  He's the really impressive one, Adam. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=285.94s)]
*  And he is a serial health care entrepreneur who's done extremely well doing good with [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=287.94s)]
*  innovative health care solutions. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=292.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=294.94s)]
*  And what do you find from the Groffs? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=295.94s)]
*  You know, the Groffs embodied very neatly a concept that's known as differentiation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=298.94s)]
*  This is the idea that kids are trying to find a niche as they're growing up. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=303.94s)]
*  And so if one sibling is doing one thing, whether it's conscious or not, another sibling [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=309.94s)]
*  might go in a different direction or their parents might even push them in a different [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=314.94s)]
*  direction. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=318.94s)]
*  So you can see where this ended up in the Groffs in that they all have careers that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=319.94s)]
*  are wildly different. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=323.94s)]
*  And then what do you come to understand about how, and this seems important, consciously [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=324.94s)]
*  or unconsciously, the Groff siblings exerted a differentiating force on each other? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=329.94s)]
*  Because that seems like it would be not something you would necessarily ever consciously intend [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=336.94s)]
*  to do. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=341.94s)]
*  I think it happens all kinds of ways, actually. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=342.94s)]
*  But the person who's most explicit about it was Sarah, who's the youngest of the three [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=344.94s)]
*  siblings. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=348.94s)]
*  Sarah had these two older siblings who were very, very academic. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=350.94s)]
*  And she felt that if she couldn't keep up with them, that was on her, she said, and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=353.94s)]
*  that her desire to keep up with them was all about her relationship to them, much less [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=357.94s)]
*  her parents. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=361.94s)]
*  So first of all, that was interesting to me. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=362.94s)]
*  It wasn't about pleasing her parents. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=363.94s)]
*  It was about keeping up with her siblings and being worthy in their eyes, I think. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=365.94s)]
*  But she also felt that she couldn't keep up with them academically. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=369.94s)]
*  And she says that she thinks she made a conscious choice to go into sports all in, because that [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=373.94s)]
*  was a domain where she knew she could excel. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=380.94s)]
*  But even more than that, she knew that Lauren wasn't that interested in it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=383.94s)]
*  And so she felt like... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=387.94s)]
*  The lane was free. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=389.94s)]
*  The lane was free. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=390.94s)]
*  And this effort that Sarah has to find her own lane really comes to head when she's 14 [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=393.94s)]
*  years old and she tells her parents that she wants to swim the length of the Nine Mile [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=398.94s)]
*  Lake that's right outside of their home. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=402.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=404.94s)]
*  And the family all sort of, you know, they're dreading this. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=405.94s)]
*  They don't think she's going to be able to do it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=407.94s)]
*  But they're like, OK, let's go. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=409.94s)]
*  Dad rose. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=411.94s)]
*  Brother's in the sailboat with them too. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=412.94s)]
*  And not only does she swim the length of the lake, but she actually broke the town record [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=413.94s)]
*  for men and for women. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=420.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=422.94s)]
*  And that record still stands. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=423.94s)]
*  And they all agree that that was a really defining moment for Sarah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=425.94s)]
*  And I think she kind of came into her own and realized, ah, this is who I am and what [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=429.94s)]
*  I'm going to keep doing and ran with it and swam with it and became this incredible triathlete. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=432.94s)]
*  And it's really interesting because there's a lot of research actually that suggests that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=439.94s)]
*  younger siblings are overrepresented in sports. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=443.94s)]
*  So there is this finding that comes up over and over again that the oldest sibling is [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=446.94s)]
*  indeed the most cognitively strong, does the best in school, gets the best grades. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=452.94s)]
*  They have this little cognitive edge. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=457.94s)]
*  Just explain that because everyone listening is going to want to understand why that is. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=459.94s)]
*  Well, there's different theories about it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=462.94s)]
*  But the one that rings the most true to me, I'll just say, is that when you're an only [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=464.94s)]
*  child, you know, your parents just shower you with a level of attention and cognitive [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=468.94s)]
*  enrichment. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=473.94s)]
*  And they have more of that attention. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=474.94s)]
*  They have literally more hours in the day to spend on that first child than they do [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=475.94s)]
*  when the second and the third come along. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=480.94s)]
*  By the way, I should emphasize that these effects are small and they are also on average. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=482.94s)]
*  So it does not mean that this is necessarily true for your family, dear listener, or dear [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=487.94s)]
*  youngest child, of which I am one. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=492.94s)]
*  But it does mean that on average this is what we see. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=494.94s)]
*  And so when you have an oldest child typically being the most academically strong, then you [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=497.94s)]
*  see this differentiation, which is that younger children are sometimes more drawn to sports [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=503.94s)]
*  or they compete a little bit harder in sports in order to define their niche and find their [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=509.94s)]
*  way and have this space where they can excel. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=514.94s)]
*  And then you actually do see in some research that younger children are overrepresented [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=517.94s)]
*  in elite sports. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=522.94s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=523.94s)]
*  And clearly that seems to be what happened with the youngest of the Groff siblings. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=524.94s)]
*  What about the middle Groff child? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=528.94s)]
*  What was her experience, Lauren? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=531.94s)]
*  So what I see in Lauren is something that's a little bit different, which is you can see [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=533.94s)]
*  in Lauren, and she's actually also quite self-aware about this, how a sense of competition [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=537.94s)]
*  with her brother was really fueling her. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=541.94s)]
*  I don't think her brother was even aware that there was a competition, but she felt like [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=544.94s)]
*  she wanted to prove something to him. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=548.94s)]
*  At one point she felt, she told me, that a huge part of what motivated her to write big, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=549.94s)]
*  bold, feminist literature was the frustration that she felt with this all-knowing older brother. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=556.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=562.94s)]
*  So what's important about the Groffs, it would seem, is that you have this academically [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=563.94s)]
*  strong and much more than he would seem to know emotionally towering figure, and the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=567.94s)]
*  two younger siblings respond in these complicated ways that it sounds like they're conscious [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=574.94s)]
*  of. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=580.94s)]
*  They seem to know it's happening. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=581.94s)]
*  And as a result, they end up in very high-achieving but extremely different lines of work. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=582.94s)]
*  That's beautifully summed up. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=588.94s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=590.94s)]
*  Well, what about the Groffs' parents? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=591.94s)]
*  In your understanding of the family, how did they launch that, to use your phrase, arrow [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=594.94s)]
*  of ambition that the sibling, especially Adam, the older brother, ultimately influences the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=599.94s)]
*  course of? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=604.94s)]
*  You know, both of the Groff parents had come from very hardscrabble backgrounds and gotten [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=605.94s)]
*  college degrees, and their father had become a doctor and was able to provide this really [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=610.94s)]
*  lovely life for his children. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=614.94s)]
*  But I think it was very important to them that their children be tough, that their children [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=616.94s)]
*  be hardworking, in part because of where they had come from. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=620.94s)]
*  So they even have this term in the family, which is Groffiness, which is a certain kind [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=622.94s)]
*  of like hard work and like brute force, getting things done. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=626.94s)]
*  Lauren once said to me that in her family, work was holy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=630.94s)]
*  And I think that is the launching of the arrow. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=633.94s)]
*  Do these siblings get along? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=636.94s)]
*  I mean, does differentiation mean ultimately difficulty? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=638.94s)]
*  Oh, I sometimes think it's the differentiation that allows them to be close because the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=642.94s)]
*  competition isn't happening. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=647.94s)]
*  That's really interesting. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=649.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=650.94s)]
*  And in fact, they are very, very close. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=651.94s)]
*  You know, Sarah moved to New Hampshire to be closer to Adam at one point in her training. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=652.94s)]
*  Sarah's been very open about mental health struggles that she's gone through. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=657.94s)]
*  She's a mental health advocate. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=661.94s)]
*  And Sarah says that Lauren was somebody who would just stay on the phone with her sometimes [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=663.94s)]
*  being there for her, even if they were very, very quiet. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=668.94s)]
*  Sue, the Groffs are a family with a fair amount of resources, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=671.94s)]
*  So how much do your findings, especially around differentiation, apply to families without [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=675.94s)]
*  those resources? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=683.94s)]
*  Does that mean that there is inherently less competition, less enrichment, less differentiation? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=684.94s)]
*  Yeah, there is some research that suggests that you see differentiation in families that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=693.94s)]
*  have the resources to shuttle kids around to different kinds of lessons. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=697.94s)]
*  And there's a lot of room for individualization in those families. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=701.94s)]
*  In less advantaged families, you don't have quite so much differentiation, but there is [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=706.94s)]
*  an equally powerful force that does shape the siblings. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=711.94s)]
*  And I really saw this at work in a family that I got to know very well called the Chens. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=715.94s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=727.94s)]
*  So Sue, tell us about the Chen family and the dynamic between the siblings in that family [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=736.94s)]
*  that was at play. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=742.94s)]
*  So the Chens were a family that had immigrated from China, and their parents ran a Chinese [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=745.94s)]
*  restaurant. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=751.94s)]
*  They were incredibly hardworking and worked very, very long hours. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=752.94s)]
*  And they just weren't around as much as parents ideally hoped to be. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=756.94s)]
*  So the siblings were extremely close, and they spent a lot of time together, and they [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=761.94s)]
*  really influenced each other very strongly. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=766.94s)]
*  And what you see in this family is a phenomenon that's called the spillover effect. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=769.94s)]
*  The spillover effect is just a reflection of the fact that when one sibling does well, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=775.94s)]
*  then the younger siblings tend to do well as well. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=780.94s)]
*  And for many years, it's been difficult to know whether that's because of genetic overlap [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=784.94s)]
*  or is there something in the environment apart from how the siblings are influencing [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=790.94s)]
*  each other. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=794.94s)]
*  But there's a really interesting study that was conducted just a few years ago that is [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=795.94s)]
*  sort of what we call a semi-natural experiment. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=800.94s)]
*  This researcher at Yale found that when children are kind of on the old side for their [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=803.94s)]
*  grade, depending on where their birthday is, we know that those kids tend to do better [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=809.94s)]
*  academically than kids who are very young for their grade. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=814.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=817.94s)]
*  So she looked at the younger siblings of those kids who happened to be doing better in school [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=818.94s)]
*  because of this developmental advantage. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=823.94s)]
*  And what she found was for the younger siblings of those kids, it didn't matter whether those [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=825.94s)]
*  kids, these younger siblings, were old for their grade, young for their grade, they did [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=830.94s)]
*  better than expected. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=833.94s)]
*  And so you really see here that is the sibling effect. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=835.94s)]
*  It's not something that's happening at home. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=839.94s)]
*  It's not genetic. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=841.94s)]
*  It's just affected by the good luck that an older sibling had in being a little bit [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=842.94s)]
*  old for the grade. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=846.94s)]
*  And what does the spillover effect look like? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=847.94s)]
*  How does it operate within the Chen family? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=849.94s)]
*  So there's four Chen siblings. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=852.94s)]
*  The oldest is Elizabeth. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=854.94s)]
*  Then comes Yi, then Gong, and then a fourth sibling who is much younger than the older [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=855.94s)]
*  ones. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=861.94s)]
*  His name is Devin. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=862.94s)]
*  When they arrived in the United States, Elizabeth was put into a grade that was two years [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=863.94s)]
*  below her age because they were so worried about her English skills that they wanted [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=868.94s)]
*  to give her a chance. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=872.94s)]
*  Not only did they give her a chance, but I think they really gave her a boost because [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=873.94s)]
*  she was going to catch up with the English pretty quickly. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=877.94s)]
*  And then she had all these other advantages, like self-control and just being more developmentally [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=879.94s)]
*  farther along. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=884.94s)]
*  And teachers really respond to that. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=886.94s)]
*  And then school becomes a really comfortable place. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=888.94s)]
*  And that was a place where she excelled. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=890.94s)]
*  And then because she did excel in school, she was able to help her siblings excel. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=893.94s)]
*  She would tell them which APs to take and she would help them with their homework. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=897.94s)]
*  And all of the siblings played instruments and she was very important in helping them [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=901.94s)]
*  practice. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=906.94s)]
*  And they all were coaching each other. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=907.94s)]
*  That was true in a way for sports as well. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=910.94s)]
*  So Yi, the oldest of the brothers, was a very accomplished wrestler. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=913.94s)]
*  But it's not that Gong then chose some other sport. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=918.94s)]
*  He didn't go in a different direction. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=921.94s)]
*  He too became a wrestler. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=922.94s)]
*  And so he benefited from his brother's expertise and they were kind of consolidating forces. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=925.94s)]
*  There's like this symbiosis. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=930.94s)]
*  And you see these kinds of so-called spillover effects. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=932.94s)]
*  They influence each other in very collaborative ways. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=935.94s)]
*  And it sounds like in this collaboration you're describing, the Chen siblings are building off [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=938.94s)]
*  one another, each one hoping that the next will do at least as well, if not better, than they did [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=943.94s)]
*  either academically or athletically. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=949.94s)]
*  That, you're saying, is the spillover effect. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=951.94s)]
*  And it really does feel quite different than the more competitive, tinged idea of differentiation. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=954.94s)]
*  I mean, it certainly looks like one mechanism of the sibling spillover effect. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=961.94s)]
*  It's the opposite of competition. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=965.94s)]
*  It's working together and influencing each other and making each other in some ways more similar, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=967.94s)]
*  which to them was about making each other better, basically. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=972.94s)]
*  You really see it in their youngest sibling, Devin. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=975.94s)]
*  They had all gone off to college themselves, or maybe were even out of college, by the time he was [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=978.94s)]
*  applying to schools. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=983.94s)]
*  And they actually felt a little bad for him that he wasn't benefiting from what they had provided [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=984.94s)]
*  for each other when they all lived in the same home at the same time. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=989.94s)]
*  There wasn't enough spill left to spill over him. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=991.94s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=993.94s)]
*  And so they would, you know, conference call with him and they actually formed a reading group [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=994.94s)]
*  to make sure that he was reading. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=999.94s)]
*  They were picking books to make sure that he was keeping up with that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1001.94s)]
*  And then when it came time for him to apply to college, they actually divided up the tasks. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1004.94s)]
*  One of them took over SAT prep and one helped him with his essays and one helped him keep on top of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1009.94s)]
*  applications and staying organized. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1015.94s)]
*  And this is one mechanism of how the spillover effect works. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1017.94s)]
*  It's Devin presumably wanting to live up to his sibling's academic success, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1020.94s)]
*  but it's them also really sharing their resources with him. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1024.94s)]
*  Where does Devin end up going to college, which of course makes me want to know what happens to all [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1027.94s)]
*  four of the Chen siblings in terms of their career? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1032.94s)]
*  So all four of the Chens were in fact valedictorians and Devin ended up going to Dartmouth [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1035.94s)]
*  and I'll spare you the colleges, they're all terrific, but there's more to life than college. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1041.94s)]
*  I know. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1046.94s)]
*  You're like, no, there's nothing more to life than college. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1047.94s)]
*  What I like about the careers they all chose that I find very moving is that they all chose careers [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1050.94s)]
*  that sort of would have helped their own parents when they were struggling in their first years in America. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1054.94s)]
*  So Elizabeth became a doctor who works with a sizable Chinese population. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1059.94s)]
*  I think that their parents rarely went to the doctor. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1064.94s)]
*  I'm sure if there had been Chinese doctors in the area, they would have been more comfortable. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1067.94s)]
*  He actually was one of the first hires at this mega restaurant software business called Toast. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1070.94s)]
*  It's like the Amazon of restaurant software and Gong ended up working at this very high-power [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1077.94s)]
*  AI English language instruction startup. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1084.94s)]
*  And then Devin works in Amazon. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1087.94s)]
*  He's a software engineer. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1089.94s)]
*  Devin likes to say that of the four siblings, he's the one who works to live where his siblings, he thinks, all live to work. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1091.94s)]
*  So in my time with this family, I was struck by how proud of each other they all were, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1097.94s)]
*  how protective of each other they all were. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1102.94s)]
*  And now, of course, they're having children of their own. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1104.94s)]
*  It's really beautiful to watch that happen and they're all really intent on the cousins being really close. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1106.94s)]
*  I mean, that's a remarkably beautiful story. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1112.94s)]
*  I wonder if spillover effects on siblings are always as constructive and positive as they were with the chens. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1114.94s)]
*  Now, that's a really important question because spillover effects, of course, can in fact work the other way. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1123.94s)]
*  We know that siblings influence each other, and that means that if a sibling's grades are suffering [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1129.94s)]
*  because of some outside force, that's also going to have an effect on their younger siblings. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1135.94s)]
*  So the concern is that if you're in a disadvantaged family, there might be some trauma, right, that affects the older sibling. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1140.94s)]
*  Adverse childhood events, we call them. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1147.94s)]
*  So if there is something traumatic that happens, I'm a junior in high school, maybe my grades suffer, okay? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1149.94s)]
*  My little sister is a freshman in high school. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1155.94s)]
*  Her grades suffer as a result of the same trauma, but also because the junior in high school's grades have suffered, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1157.94s)]
*  that too has a negative effect on that younger sibling. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1164.94s)]
*  So it's this one-two punch. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1167.94s)]
*  And so what that tells us is that if you have families that are more likely to suffer some kind of disruption like this, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1169.94s)]
*  then the grades suffer, and we know that income later in life is very closely tied to grades and test scores in high school. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1175.94s)]
*  So these kinds of sibling effects actually do have really profound policy implications. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1184.94s)]
*  What do you mean by policy implications? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1190.94s)]
*  Well, just when we think about are we going to invest in interventions, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1192.94s)]
*  it actually turns out that if you can raise the academic performance of an older sibling, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1197.94s)]
*  that investment in that intervention is all the more worthwhile because it's going to have ripple effects on the whole family, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1203.94s)]
*  or more specifically, the younger sibling. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1210.94s)]
*  And so you're not just affecting, let's say, the economic earnings of the older sibling down the road, but the younger one too. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1212.94s)]
*  You're getting so much more bang for your buck with an effective intervention than really has been previously realized. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1218.94s)]
*  I'm not trying to be facetious, but this almost sounds biblical. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1223.94s)]
*  If the eldest child is invested in properly and this spillover effect happens, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1226.94s)]
*  that seems quite important and potentially achievable. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1232.94s)]
*  I did say the oldest child, but I think it's possible that sibling effects can work in multiple directions. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1237.94s)]
*  And does that mean that younger siblings can spill over to older siblings? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1241.94s)]
*  Yes, that is what that means. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1245.94s)]
*  So now that we've talked through these two distinct but seemingly related forces of the spillover effect [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1247.94s)]
*  and differentiation between siblings, I wonder what you have found in your reporting on how controllable any of this is. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1254.94s)]
*  Parents like to think, and you hinted at this earlier, that they exert some level of influence over this kind of thing. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1263.94s)]
*  Can they? Do they? Or is it ultimately out of their control? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1272.94s)]
*  I think that parents think they have more control than they actually do over so much. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1276.94s)]
*  And trying to really change one child is kind of like checkers. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1281.94s)]
*  And then the idea that you're going to try to actually manipulate some complicated interaction over many years among multiple siblings, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1285.94s)]
*  to me that's just like playing chess with a blindfold on. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1292.94s)]
*  So there's some common sense things that I think parents aspire to, which is not to compare too much. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1295.94s)]
*  And if they have the resources to let children pick their own passions and foster them. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1300.94s)]
*  But I also think that some of the things that drive sibling relationships, such as competition and rivalry, you can manage it, but you can't necessarily control it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1306.94s)]
*  I don't think we can end this conversation without asking you about your own siblings and your relationship to them, with them. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1315.94s)]
*  Is it a story of spillover? Is it a story of differentiation? Is it a story of something else entirely? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1322.94s)]
*  I think in terms of personality, there's some differentiation there. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1328.94s)]
*  But it's also, I think, this idea of the arrow being launched and the sibling helping it land somewhere. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1331.94s)]
*  I really see that in my own family because my parents definitely valued hard work. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1337.94s)]
*  That was a huge value in our household. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1341.94s)]
*  But my brother was the person who came to me when I was 14 and said, Why don't you join the high school newspaper? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1343.94s)]
*  He was at college at the time. And I said, We don't have one anymore. It disbanded. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1350.94s)]
*  And my brother then launched into a big lecture about the decline of democracy without a free press. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1355.94s)]
*  And it was pathetic. And he kind of rallied me to try to restart the high school newspaper. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1361.94s)]
*  And I was a pretty passive kid. I spent most of my time reading in a room. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1368.94s)]
*  But my brother knew me well enough to know he knew before I knew that I would love doing journalism. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1373.94s)]
*  And I think if my parents had suggested it, I would have rolled my eyes and thought it was something they thought I should put on my application. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1378.94s)]
*  But also, God bless my parents, they were really laid back people. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1385.94s)]
*  They weren't the kind of people who were paying that much attention, you know. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1389.94s)]
*  And so it was my brother who was paying attention and who knew the school environment. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1393.94s)]
*  He knew me. He knew what high schools were supposed to have. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1397.94s)]
*  And somehow his belief that I could do it, I actually did go out and do it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1400.94s)]
*  I'm not saying it was a great high school newspaper. It was not. But it was I loved doing it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1405.94s)]
*  And from the second the first article started trickling in, I just was like, oh, this is what I want to do. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1411.94s)]
*  And so it was a really fateful conversation that we had that day. And I definitely am grateful to my brother for it. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1416.94s)]
*  I mean, let's just be explicit about how fateful. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1425.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I mean, I found my vocation. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1428.94s)]
*  Because? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1430.94s)]
*  Because my brother told me to do it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1431.94s)]
*  Told you to do it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1432.94s)]
*  He didn't just tell me to do it. He kind of bullied me into doing it. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1433.94s)]
*  I didn't want him to come home from the next vacation and be like, why didn't you start a high school newspaper, you know, and then start lecturing me all over again? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1435.94s)]
*  I didn't want to disappoint my brother. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1442.94s)]
*  And of course, there's something kind of poetic about this. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1445.94s)]
*  If your oldest sibling hadn't pushed you to create that newspaper and become a journalist, you would never go on to write a book about siblings. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1447.94s)]
*  That's true. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1457.94s)]
*  That's true. And I think it is because I've been very lucky in that way that I've also been really drawn to the subject. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1458.94s)]
*  And on that note, because I'm not talking about my family. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1464.94s)]
*  Damn. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1467.94s)]
*  Sue? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1468.94s)]
*  Yes. Thank you very much. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1469.94s)]
*  I had a question for you, Michael. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1470.94s)]
*  One last question. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1472.94s)]
*  Tomorrow. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1473.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1474.94s)]
*  On the daily. Thank you, Sue. I appreciate it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1475.94s)]
*  Oh, just my pleasure. Thank you for having me. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1477.94s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1488.94s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1508.94s)]
*  On Monday, the stock market soared and thousands of American businesses celebrated as the United States and China agreed to drastically reduce their tariffs against one another for the next three months. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1511.94s)]
*  Starting tomorrow, the U.S. will reduce its tariffs on Chinese imports from 145 percent to 30 percent. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1525.94s)]
*  China, in turn, will lower its tariffs on American goods from 125 percent to just 10 percent. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1535.94s)]
*  Negotiators from both countries will now seek to reach a permanent trade deal. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1543.94s)]
*  But few believe that either country will ever return to the sky high tariffs of the past month. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1549.94s)]
*  As a result, the S&P 500 rose 3.3 percent. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1556.94s)]
*  The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged nearly 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq climbed nearly 4.4 percent, officially entering a bull market. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1561.94s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Astha Chaturvedi and Ricky Navetsky with help from Claire Tennis-Getter. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1580.94s)]
*  It was edited by Michael Benoit and Mark George, contains original music by Marian Lozano and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1587.94s)]
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1597.94s)]
*  That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1612.94s)]
*  See you tomorrow. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBhRKjpugY&t=1615.94s)]
