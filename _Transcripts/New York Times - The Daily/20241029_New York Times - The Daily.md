# On the Ballot An Immigration System Most Americans Never Wanted
**New York Times Podcasts:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgDdTV7A57w)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  If Donald Trump wins next week's election, it will be in large part because voters embrace
*  his message that the country's immigration system is broken.
*  Today, David Leonhardt on the surprising story of how that system came to be, the very real
*  tradeoffs it's required, and just how little it reflects what Americans really want from
*  immigration.
*  It's Tuesday, October 29th.
*  Hi, David.
*  Hello, Michael.
*  It's really nice to have you in the studio.
*  I don't think we've ever done this in person before.
*  I have never been in the studio.
*  I've always been remote in Washington.
*  It is great to be here.
*  Overdue.
*  So, David, we're talking to you today because you have been studying an issue that voters
*  in this campaign for president consistently rank among their top concerns, and that is
*  immigration.
*  And yet you contend that the way we talk about this issue, the way we understand it, is very
*  incomplete, and that we tend to think about it in far too narrow a light as a question
*  at the U.S.-Mexico border when there's so much more to the subject of immigration.
*  And we wanted you to help us understand that fuller picture and how and why immigration
*  has become so central to this election and how it may influence the outcome of next week's
*  election.
*  So that's a lot.
*  Where should we start?
*  Well, first, I understand why people are so focused on the here and now.
*  We've had a historically large increase in immigration under Joe Biden's presidency.
*  Donald Trump, of course, made immigration central to his brand even before that increase.
*  Our border is open.
*  Nobody can believe it.
*  He talks about it all the time.
*  We're a dumping ground.
*  We're like a garbage can for the world.
*  Kamala Harris actually has talked a lot about immigration as well.
*  The United States is a sovereign nation, and I believe we have a duty to set rules at our
*  border and to enforce them.
*  She has promised that she will do a better job securing the border than Donald Trump.
*  And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than
*  playing political games and their personal political future.
*  And when the campaign talks about it, it's almost always focused on undocumented immigration
*  and the southern border.
*  But there's a much larger idea here, and that's that a lot of Americans feel like we have
*  an immigration system today that the voters never chose.
*  It's not an immigration system that they want.
*  And I think that's particularly resonant because so many Americans feel frustrated by the economic
*  trends in this country over the last several decades.
*  And they put these two things together.
*  They say, hey, wait a second, our lives are not going well, and we have this out of control
*  immigration system.
*  And that is part of why immigration has just become such an intense issue this year.
*  So to understand how it is that we got here and how immigration seems to be this subject
*  that never leaves politics, you have to go back much before this presidential campaign.
*  In fact, you have to go all the way back to 1965.
*  So David, tell us exactly what happens in 1965 and why it's so important.
*  It's a turning point.
*  For a long time in the 19th century, we didn't really have much immigration law in this country.
*  If you could get here, you could enter.
*  That's when a lot of people's ancestors entered.
*  It's when some of my great grandparents came here.
*  Huge numbers of Jewish immigrants, Italian immigrants, Irish immigrants come here during
*  that time.
*  But then there's really a backlash to the massive amount of immigration.
*  And in 1924, Congress passes this incredibly restrictive law that reduces immigration almost
*  to zero.
*  And the small amount of immigration that it does allow, they say, basically can come only
*  from northern and western Europe.
*  So it totally clamps down on immigration from Asia.
*  And it sets incredibly restrictive caps on immigration from eastern and southern Europe.
*  The goal would clearly seem to be a whiter, more Anglo-Saxon group of immigrants.
*  Yes.
*  It was a very clearly racist bill.
*  And the goal was essentially to stop the diversification of America that had been happening in the
*  late 1800s and early 1900s.
*  And so that really guides US immigration policy from the 1920s through the 1960s.
*  And you can understand why, amid the excitement around the civil rights movement, that people
*  look at our immigration system and they say, wait a second, at the same time that we're
*  passing civil rights bills and outlawing racial discrimination within our country, we shouldn't
*  have an immigration system that is so obviously based on race and national origin.
*  And so what changes are contemplated along those lines?
*  The central figure here is John F. Kennedy.
*  It is a proud privilege to be a citizen of the great republic, to realize that we are
*  the descendants of 40 million people who left other countries, other familiar scenes,
*  to come here to the United States to build a new life.
*  He's a senator from Massachusetts in 1960, and he's running for president.
*  And he'd published a book called A Nation of Immigrants, which really introduced that
*  notion into the popular vernacular.
*  He himself comes from an immigrant family, from Ireland.
*  He wins the presidency, of course, and he says he's going to fix this broken and racist
*  immigration system that we used to have.
*  Next week we will send to the Congress of the United States our proposals for improving
*  and modernizing the laws which govern the admission of immigrants into this country.
*  And he introduces a bill that will do that, that will open immigration to people from
*  all over the world.
*  We hope that the Congress of the United States will accept these recommendations and that
*  before this year is over, we'll have what we've needed for a good many years, which
*  is the recognition that all people can make equally good citizens and that what this country
*  needs and wants are those who wish to come here, to build their families here, and contribute
*  to the life of our country.
*  And what does this bill, as it's starting to take shape during the Kennedy administration,
*  look like?
*  From the very beginning, they separate out two different questions.
*  And this is going to be important to think about this entire debate.
*  Who and how many?
*  So let's start with the who.
*  That is what the Kennedy administration promises to fix.
*  And they say we are no longer going to make decisions based on where people come from.
*  We are going to treat the whole world equal.
*  We are going to change the who of our immigration system.
*  To be much broader.
*  To be much broader and really to make decisions based on things like, can you come and contribute
*  to our economy?
*  We don't care where you are from.
*  They also say they are not going to change the how many.
*  This is not a bill to increase immigration.
*  So as history fans know, JFK's legislative agenda mostly was stalled in Congress.
*  He's assassinated in 1963.
*  LBJ becomes president and LBJ takes up JFK's legislative agenda.
*  And so this becomes a bill that LBJ tries to pass.
*  And from the very beginning, LBJ and the people who are in charge of the bill, including Ted
*  Kennedy, JFK's younger brother, who is then an impossibly young senator, this becomes
*  the first bill that he is going to try to shepherd through the Senate.
*  And from the very beginning, all of them say, we are not changing the how many.
*  And the promise that the bill will not lead to a significant increase in immigration is
*  the number one promise that the bill's supporters make when selling it.
*  I've spent a lot of time in the congressional archives reading their speeches and reading
*  their statements.
*  It's the thing they emphasize more than anything else.
*  So when Ted Kennedy, the senator who is running this bill in the Senate, opens the hearing
*  to talk about the bill, he says the notion that this bill will lead to more immigration
*  is highly emotional, irrational, and has little foundation in fact.
*  Why is that promise so important, David, to those who are crafting this bill?
*  How many stay the same, even as the who is vastly broadening?
*  Immigration has almost always made people nervous.
*  And it's particularly made people who don't earn a lot of money nervous.
*  They get nervous that people are going to come in and take their jobs or they're going
*  to come in and lower wages because there will be a greater labor pool.
*  And that's not a crazy worry.
*  I mean, business executives have long lobbied for high immigration, in part to keep wages
*  down and have a big labor pool.
*  And so there's this underlying worry, even in the 1960s when the economy was quite good,
*  that very high immigration would hurt blue collar workers.
*  And you can see this in the poll data at the time.
*  I mean, pollsters like Gallup asked people, what do you think about changing the immigration
*  system?
*  And Americans very clearly said, we actually would like to get rid of this old system in
*  which we're making decisions based on country.
*  But when the poll said, do you want more immigration, Americans overwhelmingly said, no, we do not
*  want more immigration.
*  And the people writing the bill were well aware of that public opinion.
*  Got it.
*  How do the authors of the bill pull off what I have to imagine is a somewhat tricky balancing
*  act of making the who much, much broader, but the how many exactly the same?
*  First they're going to set a quota, 265,000 people a year.
*  It doesn't matter where you come from.
*  And they're going to start making decisions based in large part on what you can add to
*  our economy.
*  So by 1965, Robert F. Kennedy, the third Kennedy brother in the story, has been elected
*  a senator.
*  What a family.
*  I know.
*  Has been elected a senator from New York.
*  And he has this little riff where he talks about the kinds of workers who this new bill
*  is going to bring in.
*  And he says, it's going to bring in a Korean radiologist, a Japanese microbiologist, a
*  Greek chemist, a Filipina teacher of deaf children, and a Turkish urologist.
*  And then he contrasts that with who the bill will not allow in.
*  Ditch diggers.
*  And the reason he says that is the United States already has enough ditch diggers, whereas
*  we need more microbiologists and radiologists.
*  But we have enough people in this country who want to be ditch diggers and are ditch
*  diggers.
*  And by doing that, he's essentially saying, we are not going to introduce a lot of competition
*  for blue collar jobs in this country.
*  And LBJ's labor secretary goes right at this idea of labor competition.
*  He says it offers complete protection to American workers from labor competition.
*  And then the second group that the bill is going to prioritize is family members.
*  If someone's here and wants to bring her spouse over, if someone's here and they want to bring
*  their kids over.
*  And so the second group that the bill is going to allow in are family members.
*  But here's where we get to the wrinkle, Michael, which is many family members in this bill
*  don't count toward the quota of 265,000 immigrants a year.
*  Why not?
*  Well, they weren't seen as threatening to labor competition.
*  You can imagine if you're bringing in a young child or you're bringing in a parent or grandparent,
*  they're not going to compete for those ditch digging jobs.
*  And so relatives are largely not counted toward the quota.
*  Now in the moment, I think it's important to say there were members of Congress and
*  critics who realized that this could be a problem.
*  One of them was Michael Fagan, a congressman from the west side of Cleveland.
*  And he said, wait a second, why don't we just set a real cap of 325,000 a year?
*  Doesn't matter whether you're a family member or a worker, you will count toward it.
*  And the bill's advocate said, no, no, no, we don't need to do that.
*  The family members aren't going to be a big enough deal.
*  We're going to stick with this idea of a 265,000 a year cap that applies to some people, but
*  not others.
*  Hmm.
*  Hindsight's always 20-20.
*  But this does seem like a very big loophole, allowing essentially, if I'm understanding
*  this correctly, a kind of unlimited number of family members to come in and not count
*  against the quota.
*  Yes, it does.
*  I think one of the things that happened is that the people raising questions about the
*  quota, like Michael Fagan, were immigration restrictionists.
*  They were often also racists who wanted to keep the United States population heavily
*  Western European.
*  And so I think it became easy for the people pushing the bill to just ignore a lot of what
*  they were saying, even though the people pushing the bill were putting in place a system that
*  had this massive loophole.
*  And a bill with this big loophole passes, and it becomes the Immigration and Nationality
*  Act of 1965.
*  And LBJ signs it at the base of the Statue of Liberty.
*  Distinguished governors and mayors, my fellow countrymen.
*  And it's fascinating what LBJ says when signing it.
*  Our beautiful America was built by a nation of strangers from a hundred different places
*  or more.
*  He very much adopts the language of a nation of immigrants.
*  The land flourished because it was fed from so many sources, because it was nourished
*  by so many cultures and traditions and peoples.
*  And so he has soaring language about that, but he does something that presidents don't
*  normally do when signing a big bill.
*  This bill that we will sign today is not a revolutionary bill.
*  It does not affect the lives of millions.
*  It will not reshape the structure of our daily lives or really add importantly to either
*  our wealth or our power.
*  He promises that it's actually not that big of a deal.
*  And that is his way of connecting the salesmanship of the bill, the promises to the American
*  people that this isn't going to change the how many of immigration.
*  This bill says simply that from this day forth, those wishing to immigrate to America shall
*  be admitted on the basis of their skills and their close relationships to those already
*  here.
*  It's only going to change the who of immigration.
*  I have a very strong suspicion that the promise that this is not going to change all that
*  much turns out to be wrong.
*  You've noticed my foreshadowing.
*  So what actually happens?
*  Almost immediately, immigration begins to surge in the United States.
*  And the overwhelming reason that it begins to surge is this loophole that allows many
*  family members to come in without being counted toward the quota.
*  So by 1968, our newspaper, the New York Times runs a story that says the extent of the change
*  has surprised even those who fought hardest for it.
*  And in 1971, the Washington Post runs a story where they interviewed Dennis Syntilis, a
*  Greek immigrant in Queens, who describes having helped 24 of his family members come into
*  the United States.
*  One immigrant.
*  Yes.
*  And so you also start to see this in the numbers.
*  So remember, the cap was 265,000 a year.
*  An actual immigration in 1965, the year the bill passes, is 300,000 a year, a little bit
*  above the cap.
*  By 1970, it's 373,000 a year.
*  This is legal immigration.
*  By 1980, it's 524,000 a year.
*  And by 1990, it succeeded 1 million.
*  Wow.
*  So hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands more immigrants than the quota envisions.
*  Yes.
*  In some ways, the loophole becomes more important than the quota itself.
*  And when you go back and you look at graphs that show the percentage of the United States
*  population that is foreign born, you really see the late 1960s as the point where it begins
*  to rise because of this law.
*  So how do Americans react to this influx, knowing that it's not what they had been told
*  would happen?
*  Initially, there's actually not that much of a reaction.
*  The growth in the immigrant population happens slowly.
*  It happens over time.
*  So we don't overnight have a massive increase in the immigrant population.
*  But one thing that starts to change this issue is in the 1980s and then the 1990s, illegal
*  immigration becomes a much bigger deal.
*  Just describe that and how it interacts with the rise in legal immigration that you've
*  been describing.
*  Historically, immigration at the southern border, immigration from Latin America, just
*  wasn't a big issue.
*  There actually weren't a lot of people coming from Latin America for many decades.
*  Many people in Latin America were too poor to make the journey.
*  It requires some resources actually to immigrate.
*  But by the 1980s and 90s, that's changing.
*  And it does become more possible for people to get to the US border.
*  People in Latin America have more money.
*  Transportation is better.
*  People get to the United States.
*  They can call home and tell their relatives that they made it.
*  And this, of course, is the era of Ronald Reagan and the first George Bush.
*  And they don't fix the problem with illegal immigration.
*  In part, it's that their backers, of course, are a lot of corporate executives.
*  And corporate executives tend to like high immigration, both legal and illegal.
*  It gives them more workers and it can hold wages down for businesses.
*  And so this problem starts to build in the 1980s.
*  And by the 1990s, it's really a central issue in American politics.
*  Voters look around and they say the border is chaotic.
*  And to a lot of voters, it feels unfair, particularly to recent immigrants.
*  They said, I went through this long process to get into this country.
*  And now I see other people skipping the line.
*  And at the same time that illegal immigration is rising, in the background, remember, we
*  still have the legal immigration rising that we talked about.
*  By 1990, we've got more than a million people a year coming here legally in significant
*  part because of the loophole in that law.
*  And so you put these two together.
*  And by the 80s and 90s, you really have a very large increase in the number of people
*  who are coming to this country, often trying to get blue collar work.
*  And you begin to see concerns among both Republicans and Democrats and independents about how immigration
*  is changing the United States and how it may be contributing to slow growing wages for
*  workers.
*  And there is one person in particular in Washington, a Democrat, who really tries to address this
*  situation.
*  And she tries to fix the unintended consequences of the 1965 law in the 1990s.
*  And I think her struggle to do that really helps explain how we've ended up where we've
*  ended up today on immigration.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So David, tell us about this Democrat who tries to fix the immigration system.
*  Her name is Barbara Jordan.
*  And I bet a lot of our listeners haven't heard of her or don't know much about her.
*  But she really was an icon in the 1970s and 80s in the United States.
*  Barbara Jordan grew up in Houston when it was segregated and Barbara Jordan was black.
*  And she is a star student.
*  And she becomes a star debater in college.
*  And people who do debate often go into politics and she goes into politics and she works on
*  the 1960 JFK LBJ presidential campaign.
*  And she rises up through Texas politics a little bit.
*  And LBJ, who's gotten to know her, encouraged her to run for Congress.
*  And in 1972, Jordan runs for Congress and wins.
*  And two years after she enters Congress, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
*  She has the signature moment during the Watergate hearings.
*  A president is impeachable if he attempts to subvert the Constitution.
*  If the impeachment provision in the Constitution of the United States will not reach the official
*  defenses charged here, then perhaps that 18th century constitution should be abandoned
*  to a 20th century paper shredder.
*  Where she delivers this thundering speech calling Nixon to task for breaking the law
*  in Watergate.
*  And this is something that millions of Americans watch.
*  And it really makes her famous.
*  She becomes a major civil rights leader.
*  She's known for trying to expand voting access for her Latino constituents in Texas.
*  Ladies and gentlemen, in case you don't know it, may I now present our second keynote speaker,
*  the Honorable Barbara Jarden, Democrat of Houston, Texas.
*  And then in 1976, she speaks to the Democratic National Convention.
*  I feel that notwithstanding the past, that my presence here is one additional bit of
*  evidence that the American dream need not forever be deferred.
*  But Jarden retires quite early because of illness.
*  She goes back home to Texas to teach.
*  And then in the 1990s, President Clinton reaches out to her.
*  Legal and illegal immigration have been rising for years, and people are getting mad about
*  it.
*  Bill Clinton needs a way to address it and try to fix the system.
*  And so he turns to Barbara Jarden.
*  She's from Texas, a border state, and she's this renowned communicator of American values.
*  So Clinton asks her to lead a commission that will recommend how the country can fix its
*  broken immigration system.
*  And at first, Jarden says no.
*  She doesn't really have any background in immigration.
*  But she ultimately becomes persuaded that there aren't many people who could bring the
*  moral authority that she could to this.
*  And also that she spent much of her career thinking about what is America.
*  And this is a central part of that question.
*  And so how does she approach this assignment that Bill Clinton gives her?
*  Well, she does what commission chairs do.
*  She takes testimony.
*  She travels around the country.
*  She looks at data and evidence.
*  And she ultimately comes to this conclusion that's a little bit counterintuitive.
*  She argues that there's a fundamental difference between being pro-immigrant and being pro-immigration.
*  And she says we are a nation of immigrants.
*  But at the same time, she says that doesn't mean we should always want higher and higher
*  levels of immigration.
*  In fact, sometimes having higher and higher levels of immigration can hurt immigrants.
*  Immigrants who came here several years ago are often the ones who compete for jobs with
*  the very most recent immigrants.
*  And when immigration gets too high, it can lead to a political backlash that hurts people
*  who came here, often legally, several years before.
*  In other words, if you're too pro-immigration, it will undermine the position of being pro-immigrant.
*  That's exactly right.
*  It's a version of in everything moderation.
*  If you really care about the well-being of immigrants, you can't just dial immigration
*  up to too high of a level.
*  And once she and the commission settle on these conclusions, Jordan then goes out and
*  presents them to the country.
*  And one of the more intriguing places that she does so is at a political convention in
*  1995, hosted by Ross Perot, who of course had run as an independent candidate for president
*  in 1992 and was thinking of running again in 1996.
*  It has been my privilege to know her for many years.
*  Let's give her a big hello.
*  Come on up.
*  And Jordan goes there and she tells this convention what she has concluded.
*  We have concluded that a properly regulated legal immigration system is in the national
*  interest.
*  It is in our national interest to unite families and create economic growth and protect those
*  who flee persecution, as many before the immigrants of today seeking freedom in this land of opportunity
*  have sought.
*  But I said properly regulated.
*  And I mean that.
*  And in this speech, she lays out the case for immigration reform, for changing our laws.
*  Immigration is not a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution to everyone anywhere in
*  the world who thinks they want to come to the United States.
*  Immigration is a privilege.
*  She believes, yes, the United States is a nation of immigrants, but both of those words
*  matter.
*  We are a nation of immigrants and we need a policy that serves the national interest.
*  The commission recommendations are intended to continue the benefits of legal immigration
*  while limiting costs.
*  And there are costs.
*  Good things are rarely free.
*  She says what many Americans believe a nation needs to make decisions about who will enter
*  and who will not be allowed to enter.
*  We are a country of laws.
*  And she starts by talking about illegal immigration.
*  For our immigration policy to make sense, it is necessary to make distinctions between
*  those who obey the law and those who violate it.
*  Therefore, we disagree with those who would label any effort to control illegal immigration
*  as somehow inherently anti-immigrant.
*  Unlawful immigration is not acceptable.
*  She's got multiple recommendations for what the country should do to stem illegal immigration.
*  And she specifically says that the country should put in place a system using Social
*  Security numbers and driver's licenses to make it difficult for companies to employ
*  people who are here illegally, because that will make it much less likely that huge numbers
*  of people want to come to this country.
*  The abuse of our economy by unlawful workers and those who hire them, the undermining of
*  wages and working conditions we have fought so long to protect.
*  These are the things that must stop.
*  And what about legal immigration?
*  The commission also calls for less legal immigration.
*  It says, look, we need to continue doing many forms of legal immigration.
*  We need to admit members of an immigrant's nuclear family.
*  We need to admit highly skilled workers and we need to admit political refugees who are
*  fleeing oppression.
*  But we don't need to admit so many extended family members who came in through the loophole
*  of the 1965 law.
*  And they effectively call for closing that loophole.
*  Now it is not that we believe immigration of extended family members are harmful, but
*  we do not have unlimited numbers of immigrant visas.
*  And she also says the commission finds no national interest in continuing to import
*  lesser skilled and unskilled workers to compete with the most vulnerable parts of our labor
*  force.
*  Many American workers do not now have adequate job prospects and they're not improving.
*  With welfare reform, many more unskilled American workers will enter the labor market.
*  We should make their task easier to find employment, not harder, by having a priority of unskilled
*  foreign labor.
*  And overall, they call for a one-third reduction in legal immigration to the United States.
*  Which it sounds like would bring the system back to the stated intent, but not the practical
*  realities of the 1965 law.
*  Exactly right.
*  And one of the reasons Barbara Jordan wanted to make these changes is she was worried that
*  if we didn't, the politics of immigration would become so toxic that a future Congress
*  or president, a future anti-immigration Congress or president, would be able to cut down even
*  on the kinds of immigration that are so important to what this country is.
*  We cannot evade the responsibility to make the necessary choices to reform immigration.
*  It's literally a matter of who we are as a nation and who we become as a people.
*  E pluribus unum.
*  Out of many, one.
*  One.
*  So what happens to these recommendations once Jordan and the commission bring them to President
*  Clinton?
*  Well, at first, Bill Clinton's very enthusiastic.
*  In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of
*  illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the work
*  face as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.
*  He embraces the recommendations.
*  He suggests he's going to try to get them passed.
*  It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind
*  of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop
*  it.
*  But almost immediately, political opposition starts forming and it starts forming on both
*  sides.
*  So on the Republican side, you hear these Republicans saying we need immigration.
*  It leads to more entrepreneurs.
*  It leads to a larger labor force.
*  They don't say it can hold down wages, but obviously that's part of what they want, which
*  of course is exactly why Barbara Jordan wanted to keep down the right of immigration.
*  But you also have a big part of the Democratic Party that is really opposed to immigration
*  restriction.
*  It's civil rights groups.
*  In some cases, it is Latino or Asian American groups that want to keep immigration high.
*  And so the kind of things Jordan is calling for, polling consistently suggests are popular.
*  But among activists and politicians in Washington, in many ways, political elites on the left
*  and the right, there's a real discomfort with reducing immigration or cracking down on illegal
*  immigration.
*  And so the recommendations largely do not become law.
*  A few things do, such as a voluntary system for checking whether workers are in this country
*  legally.
*  Voluntary.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, this idea that we're going to say to businesses, we're going to let you decide
*  whether you opt into a system that tells us whether you're breaking the law.
*  You can guess how effective that was.
*  So for the most part, although some of Jordan's recommendations become law, we continue to
*  have the basic dynamics of the immigration system that the 1965 law gave us.
*  I guess I don't quite understand why Bill Clinton would have bowed to those pressures,
*  David, because it sounds like a bunch of elites, activists, business leaders are the ones trying
*  to torpedo this.
*  But Bill Clinton has many political gifts.
*  And one of them is to recognize what gets someone elected or reelected.
*  And it feels like what Barbara Jordan is really telling him is that high levels of immigration,
*  legal and illegal, are a threat to working class America.
*  And Bill Clinton would have understood, I'd have to think, that working class America
*  is really essential to the Democratic Party that he leads.
*  I think two things are happening here.
*  One, the economy just keeps getting stronger over the course of the 1990s, which is a reminder
*  that immigration is just one force among many that shapes an economy, and it's not the main one.
*  And the second thing is that political elites really matter.
*  And what has happened over the last few decades is that both of our parties became ever more
*  dominated by college graduates and people who had the concerns and interests of college
*  graduates as opposed to working class people.
*  And so Democrats become a little bit less focused on what blue collar workers want.
*  And we see this with both trade and immigration.
*  And in the Republican Party, those same corporate interests that have long had huge sway over
*  the Republican Party do.
*  And so when you think of official Washington and the people who are making policy and who
*  are lobbying for it, you just have much less pressure for changes to the immigration system
*  than public opinion might suggest that you would.
*  This is reminding me so much of what happened with NAFTA, with the North American Free Trade
*  Agreement, which is that elites, powerful entrenched forces in Washington increasingly
*  disconnected from working class America, see nothing but upside in globalization and free
*  trade and don't anticipate the ways in which NAFTA will hurt working class America.
*  There's not much dispute that it does.
*  I think that's exactly right.
*  And I think one of the real mistakes that proponents of immigration have made, and this
*  is both business conservatives who want more immigration and it's progressives who, from
*  a justice perspective, want more immigration.
*  I think one of the real mistakes they've made is they tend to argue that immigration is
*  a free lunch.
*  And in fact, immigration just benefits everyone.
*  And the research doesn't support that idea, nor do people's everyday experiences support
*  that idea.
*  Immigration has tradeoffs.
*  It has enormous advantages for an economy.
*  But it also has some costs, and those costs do tend to be borne disproportionately by
*  working class people.
*  And that's part of why so many people are so anxious about it.
*  Well, let's talk about some of those tradeoffs.
*  And I think it would be helpful for you to be as specific as possible about the upsides
*  of higher immigration as well as the cost, because you just mentioned that there seems
*  to be research and data there.
*  There is.
*  Let's start with the upsides.
*  The biggest beneficiaries of immigration are immigrants themselves.
*  Research suggests the typical experience is that an immigrant who comes here poor remains
*  poor, but that immigrant's children do significantly better and the grandchildren do really well.
*  And after just a few generations, these immigrants look like native born Americans in terms of
*  their outcomes.
*  And then there are other benefits for people who are already in this country.
*  Immigrants expand the labor pool.
*  They can particularly cut the cost of services, and they can particularly cut the cost of
*  services that upper income people often use.
*  Yard work, daycare, other services where large numbers of immigrants work in those industries.
*  And in the long term, immigrants can also expand the economy.
*  They can create more demand for all kinds of things.
*  But they become consumers.
*  They become consumers themselves.
*  And then finally, there's a little bit more of a subjective benefit, which is I think
*  many Americans would say it's just more interesting to live in a more diverse country, a country
*  where fashion and culture and music and all of those things are more diverse.
*  Right.
*  And what about the costs?
*  Economists have been looking at this for a long time.
*  And I think perhaps the best summary is this 2017 report from the National Academy of Sciences,
*  which brought together some of the biggest experts on immigration in the country and
*  looked at immigration's effect on all kinds of things, including on wages.
*  And that report produced a table where they listed a whole bunch of studies, all the studies
*  that cleared their bar for really trying to tell us something important about how immigration
*  affects the wages of native born Americans.
*  And when you look down that chart, you notice something.
*  Immigration is dominated by negative numbers, which is to say that more immigration does
*  tend to reduce wages, particularly of the least educated lower income workers.
*  Right.
*  And that makes intuitive sense because if you have more people, especially at the lower
*  education and skill level, suddenly seeking the same work, then supply of that work has
*  gone up and therefore wages for it will go down.
*  Of course.
*  It's one of the most basic laws of economics.
*  Of course, the argument is frequently made that we are talking here about jobs that non-immigrants
*  in the United States don't want or are unlikely to do.
*  What do the economists and what does the research say about that?
*  You definitely hear that argument.
*  And there are some jobs that native born Americans and immigrants who are already here probably
*  don't want to do.
*  But let's think about some of the jobs we've been talking about in this episode, Michael,
*  ditch diggers.
*  You imagine a blue collar job like construction, digging ditches, building houses.
*  A lot of people who are already in this country and who are struggling to find good paying
*  work would be very happy to do jobs like that, particularly if it paid a decent wage.
*  Which in theory might be easier to get if immigration rates were lower.
*  Yes.
*  And that's exactly how a lot of Americans feel.
*  And I should emphasize that the qualms that people have about immigration are not just
*  about wages.
*  They may not even mostly be about wages.
*  Obviously, a meaningful amount of the opposition to immigration is related to race and involves
*  racism.
*  Obviously.
*  But that isn't the only thing going on.
*  Imagine that you lived in a community in South Texas or in a neighborhood in Chicago or Denver,
*  two cities that are magnets for immigrants.
*  And in just a short period of time, the population of your community increased by 10% or even
*  20%.
*  Think about what that would do to a local school in terms of how many kids were there,
*  in terms of how many of them needed services, like English as a second language.
*  Think about the strain it would place on local hospitals and other social services.
*  And then remember that the communities that tend to experience these strains, they're
*  not affluent communities.
*  They tend to be blue collar communities, lower income communities.
*  They are the ones that are on the front lines of the real societal strains that immigration
*  can create.
*  All this, of course, anticipates the rise of Donald Trump as a candidate who, in his
*  announcement for president in 2015, rails against immigrants and the consensus that
*  the elites in both parties have reached, both Democrat and Republican, that high rates of
*  immigration are healthy for the country.
*  I'm curious in doing all this research and all this reporting about immigration, how
*  you look back on that moment now.
*  Donald Trump, when he talks about immigration, often lies and he often uses racist stereotypes.
*  And it's really important to say both of those things.
*  And at the same time, he exposed a real vulnerability of the political elites.
*  A lot of leading Republicans thought that the policies they pursued on both increasing
*  trade and immigration were popular with their voters.
*  And Trump is able to take over the Republican Party almost immediately in 2015 and 2016
*  in large part because he expresses so much hostility to these policies that the elites
*  have been pursuing on both.
*  And he speaks to the frustration of so many working class Americans, including Republicans,
*  who for decades have had really slow growth in their income and in their wealth and in
*  other measures of well-being.
*  And they don't buy into what was for a long time a conservative vision of more trade and
*  more immigration will help everyone.
*  It is central to Trump's rise as the Republican standard bearer.
*  And David, my recollection is that Trump is not just very critical of illegal immigration,
*  which is probably what he's best known for.
*  But once he becomes president, quite critical of the levels of legal immigration as well.
*  That's right.
*  So not only is he trying to build a wall at the border and not only is he pursuing a bunch
*  of policies that feel quite cruel like separating families, but he's trying to put in place
*  the Muslim ban to try to keep out people from predominantly Muslim countries.
*  Another example is that he called for a big cut in legal migration, specifically by cracking
*  down on what he has described as chain migration, which is the term that opponents use for this
*  extended family migration in which one person comes and brings a relative and that relative
*  then brings another relative.
*  And that's what the metaphor of chain is referring to.
*  And Democrats respond to this by really moving even further in the direction of pro-immigration
*  than they had been in the 1990s and early 2000s.
*  In reaction to him.
*  In reaction to Trump.
*  Biden runs for office for president in 2020, sending a message saying, I will be different
*  from Donald Trump.
*  I will not violate fundamental American values in the way he has by separating families,
*  by speaking so cruelly about immigrants.
*  And once Biden takes office, he actually loosens our immigration policy in a bunch of ways.
*  This is all very technocratic.
*  It involves things like asylum rules and parole rules.
*  But because Biden both spoke so welcomingly about immigration while running for president,
*  in a debate broadcast by Univision, a channel, of course, watched by many Latinos in this
*  country and in other countries, and then loosened policies when he took office, you see this
*  enormous surge of immigration to the United States and overall net immigration to the
*  United States combining legal and illegal under Biden is more than three times as high
*  as it was under Trump.
*  Wow.
*  Twice as high as it was under either Obama or George W. Bush.
*  And immigration under Joe Biden really is higher than it's been under any president
*  in many, many decades.
*  All of this brings us to where we are today and where I think we started this conversation,
*  David, with immigration being a major concern for voters among their top concerns and poll
*  after poll after poll showing that voters trust Donald Trump more to tackle the issue
*  than Kamala Harris, which given the numbers you just described makes some real sense,
*  given that Harris was Biden's vice president and oversaw this major increase in both legal
*  and illegal immigration.
*  And it feels like the unique threat that the issue of immigration right now would pose
*  to Kamala Harris is that the entire Democratic Party and brand has gotten to a place where
*  the way it talks about immigration in general is as far away from working class America
*  as one can imagine.
*  Yes.
*  And look, Donald Trump is more extreme on immigration than most Americans and most working
*  class Americans are.
*  And polling shows that a lot of people are actually uncomfortable about how he talks
*  about it.
*  But the Democrats have moved so far from where people are on immigration that Donald Trump
*  has ended up closer to where many Americans are than the Democratic Party is.
*  And so the Democrats are really struggling to get consistent with public opinion on this
*  issue in some ways similar to the way in which Republicans are really having a hard time
*  getting consistent with public opinion on abortion.
*  And while abortion is one of the Democrats strongest issues in this election, immigration
*  is really the mirror image of it in which a lot of voters don't trust the Democratic
*  Party on it.
*  And it is a reason for them to consider voting for Donald Trump.
*  What's interesting, of course, is that Barbara Jordan was a Democrat and the 1965 law was
*  passed by Democrats.
*  And so Democrats could very well and maybe even quite naturally own this subject.
*  And yet from what you're saying, the Democrats have drifted further and further from their
*  own legacy.
*  That's right.
*  We've seen Kamala Harris return to that legacy in her presidential campaign.
*  She has really mixed this idea of we need tough border security and we are a nation
*  of immigrants.
*  The problem for her, of course, is that she has to both run on the Biden record and there's
*  tape of her saying very different things only four or five years ago.
*  But you're right, Michael, that a lot of the old principles of where the Democratic Party
*  was on immigration and where Kamala Harris is now are actually quite consistent with
*  public opinion on this issue.
*  What seems very clear in having this conversation with you and for me was something of a revelation
*  is how much our current immigration system is a broken promise.
*  Right?
*  In 65, leaders of both parties said that the law they were passing would not meaningfully
*  increase immigration.
*  It absolutely did by a lot with real consequences, economic, social and political efforts to
*  bring it back to the promises of that law have basically gone nowhere ever since.
*  And whether as a voter you are drawn to Trump's very harsh at times approach to immigration,
*  including mass deportations, we haven't talked a lot about in this episode, or Harris's comparatively
*  gentler approach to this question, that broken promise does feel like an important backdrop
*  to the question of immigration and this election.
*  It is.
*  And it also reminds me of two larger points about our political system.
*  One is that Washington and the politicians who make our policies really have ignored
*  the views of working class people on many issues for a long time.
*  And trade and immigration are signature examples.
*  And what politicians of both parties have often done is they've talked down to voters.
*  They've said, no, no, you don't understand.
*  Trade is good for you.
*  Or they've said, no, no, no, immigration doesn't hurt your wages as much as you think it does.
*  And voters have rebelled and they've rebelled for a series of reasons, one of which is definitely
*  that our economy hasn't been very good for Americans who don't have a college degree
*  for several decades now.
*  And the second thing is that we live in a democracy.
*  We live in a democracy in which we elect people to pass laws.
*  And when Washington comes to the American people, as it did in 1965, and says, hey,
*  we're going to pass an immigration law, and above all, we promise it won't lead to a huge
*  surge in immigration, and then it does lead to a huge surge in immigration, that's not
*  sustainable.
*  It simply is not sustainable in a democracy to have our elected representatives promise
*  us one thing and then have it do the exact opposite of what they promised.
*  Whatever you support in immigration, it doesn't work.
*  And so as we think about the future of immigration, solving it is going to be incredibly difficult.
*  We continue to need immigration on some level for a variety of reasons.
*  But I think we're not going to get to a sustainable immigration system until Washington reckons
*  with the past failure to produce what it promised the American people it was going to produce.
*  Well, David, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Much of this episode was drawn from David's new book, entitled, Ours Was the Shining Future,
*  The Story of the American Dream.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The United States is warning that North Korean soldiers are now poised to participate in
*  an assault on Ukrainian troops operating in Russia's western region.
*  Such an assault would demonstrate that as the United States has feared for weeks, North
*  Korea has officially become a combatant in the war between Russia and Ukraine.
*  The United States now estimates that North Korea has sent 10,000 troops to Russia in
*  a major expansion of the war.
