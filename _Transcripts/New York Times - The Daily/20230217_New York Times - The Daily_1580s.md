Video Description: For the past 50 years, the race to become the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee has been shaped by the where the contest begins: Iowa.


But that process could soon be overhauled. In a coming meeting of the Democratic National Committee, South Carolina — a state that is more representative of the party and, possibly, of the country — could take over the key role of going first.


Guest: Adam Nagourney (https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-nagourney?smid=pc-thedaily) , a West Coast cultural affairs correspondent for The New York Times.


Background reading: 

  •  President Biden’s push to abandon Iowa for younger, racially diverse states is likely to reward candidates who connect with the party’s most loyal voters (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/04/us/politics/democrats-presidential-primary-calendar.html) .
  •  Reshuffling the early-state order could run into logistical issues in Georgia and New Hampshire (https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/05/us/politics/democrats-primary-calendar.html) .

# A Revolution in How Democrats Pick a President
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=0.0s)]
*  This is a daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=4.38s)]
*  For the past 50 years, how the Democratic Party picks its presidential nominee has been [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=10.6s)]
*  profoundly shaped by the state where the process begins. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=17.32s)]
*  Iowa. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=22.0s)]
*  Today. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=23.0s)]
*  Why in the coming days Democrats are poised to abandon that tradition? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=25.0s)]
*  My colleague Adam Nagourney explains. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=31.88s)]
*  It's Thursday, February 2nd. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=41.28s)]
*  Adam, tell us about this meeting that's about to get underway in Philadelphia. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=44.28s)]
*  So, the Democratic National Committee, which is essentially the governing body of the Democratic [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=55.64s)]
*  Party, is about to gather in Philadelphia for its annual meeting. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=61.64s)]
*  And you know, these meetings tend to be kind of boring, if I may say so. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=65.48s)]
*  But there is something really contentious and I would argue historically important [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=71.16s)]
*  on the agenda this time. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=77.0s)]
*  And that is that the Democratic National Committee is going to debate and vote on a proposal [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=78.32s)]
*  put forward by President Biden to do a pretty major overhaul of the presidential nominating [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=83.8s)]
*  calendar for 2024. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=90.44s)]
*  And while that might make your eyes glaze over, it's pretty meaningful and important [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=92.48s)]
*  because what it means is that Iowa, which has been the first state in this process since [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=98.24s)]
*  1972, is about to get knocked out of that spot. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=106.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing more constant in American politics than Iowa going first. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=107.88s)]
*  It's just what you do. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=112.19999999999999s)]
*  You know, for someone like me, who's been covering this stuff for a long time, it's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=113.52s)]
*  really kind of striking. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  It's a real moment of transition and it reflects the reality, which has become more and more [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  true over the years, that Iowa just does not represent the Democratic Party anymore. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=123.96s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense anymore for the Democratic Party to start the whole nominating [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=130.2s)]
*  process. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=134.6s)]
*  It's going to end up choosing a candidate for president in a place like Iowa. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=135.6s)]
*  Well, Adam, how did we get to this system, this Iowa first system that many in the party [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=138.48s)]
*  now think doesn't make sense and needs to be massively overhauled? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  What's the backstory? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, as in many things in politics, this was a solution to a previous problem. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=150.24s)]
*  To understand why we are where we are today, you have to go back to 1968. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  Chicago, Illinois, the convention of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=163.0s)]
*  So that was the year that the Democratic National Convention was being held in Chicago. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=167.8s)]
*  Members of the Youth International Party, Yippies, they called themselves, converged [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=172.88000000000002s)]
*  on Chicago. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  And the country was convulsed with unrest. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=177.92s)]
*  There was anger over the Vietnam War. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  And a lot of Democratic voters wanted the party to nominate a candidate who would end [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=187.72s)]
*  the war in Vietnam. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=192.76s)]
*  The struggle on the floor of this convention will determine whether we have the courage [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=193.95999999999998s)]
*  to say that we were wrong and even greater courage to chart a course towards peace in Vietnam. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  But back then, voters didn't really have much of a say in the process. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  It was party bosses who met behind the scenes to choose a nominee. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=211.76s)]
*  So all those jokes about smoke-filled back rooms where deals are cut and decisions are [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  made, well, that was kind of true. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=221.28s)]
*  It really happened. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=223.76s)]
*  And that's how the party ended up with Hubert Humphrey. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=224.76s)]
*  It's not the year for frenzy or inflammatory rhetoric. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=226.56s)]
*  And Hubert Humphrey was not a candidate who was about to end the war. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=233.16s)]
*  I submit that 1968 is the year for common sense to the American people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=236.44s)]
*  Humphrey goes on, loses the election to Richard Nixon, and the backlash against the Democratic [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=243.64s)]
*  establishment was intense. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=249.4s)]
*  People were really upset that the party chose someone that didn't represent the sentiment [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=251.32s)]
*  of a lot of voters. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=255.76s)]
*  And the party responded by creating a commission to rewrite the nominating process. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=257.72s)]
*  And that's what resulted in a series of state-by-state contests where voters and not party bosses [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=263.16s)]
*  would have to say over who the nominee would be. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  And why was Iowa chosen to go first? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=279.44000000000005s)]
*  There was never a decision that we, the Democratic Party, should start in Iowa. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=283.0s)]
*  It wasn't as if the committee took a look at the whole country and said, huh, Iowa is [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=287.48s)]
*  the most representative state of the Democratic Party, therefore we should do this first. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=291.36s)]
*  No, it just was more a matter of logistics. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  And that's because Iowa has a very time-consuming and dare I say convoluted process for choosing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  its presidential nominee. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=304.36s)]
*  Most states have a primary. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=306.68s)]
*  On a certain day, voters go to a voting booth, cast their ballot, wherever they want, and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=308.24s)]
*  go home. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=312.6s)]
*  That's it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=313.6s)]
*  But not Iowa. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=314.6s)]
*  Iowa has something called a caucus. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=315.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=317.2s)]
*  Can you remind us how that works, a caucus? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=318.2s)]
*  On a Monday night, voters who want to have a say in the choice of their party's nominee [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=322.08s)]
*  have to go to local places, churches, schoolhouses, sometimes even people's living rooms. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=327.2s)]
*  And you go in there and you are gathered in clusters of people who support the various [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=332.92s)]
*  candidates, right? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=339.44s)]
*  And you make your case for why you're voting for who you're voting. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=340.44s)]
*  And each candidate has to reach a certain threshold of support. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=343.4s)]
*  And if he or she doesn't, then the candidate falls out and the voters sort of shuffle around [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=348.04s)]
*  the room. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=353.52000000000004s)]
*  And after some debate and discussion, end up with one of the other candidates. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  So it's a long process. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=359.32s)]
*  So therefore, in order to be part of the calendar, to fit into the calendar, Iowa had to start [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  early. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=364.36s)]
*  And starting early meant being first to make sure it got done in time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=365.36s)]
*  It just kind of happened. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=370.0s)]
*  And then once it happened, it was hard to unhappen. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=371.72s)]
*  Got it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=374.36s)]
*  So this is really a matter of logistics and, in a sense, Iowa's inefficiency. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=375.44s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=380.88s)]
*  And the first time it happens is 1972. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=381.88s)]
*  But the first time it really matters is 1976, because that's when something really remarkable [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=384.82s)]
*  took place in the Democratic Party. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=390.12s)]
*  There were 17 candidates who were seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=394.48s)]
*  And one of them was a little known former peanut farmer from Georgia, the governor. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=399.76s)]
*  Jimmy who? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=404.36s)]
*  Jimmy who? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=405.36s)]
*  Jimmy Carter's best [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=406.36s)]
*  Name Jimmy Carter. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=407.62s)]
*  And Carter realized that if he did well in Iowa, the first state in this relatively new [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=410.04s)]
*  nominating process, he could show to the party and to the world that he was a really viable [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=415.88s)]
*  candidate. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  It's not going to be an easy campaign, as you know. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  And he also realized that Iowa was a place that you could win by just churning it out. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=424.04s)]
*  Let me meet you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=429.76s)]
*  I'm Jimmy Carter. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=430.76s)]
*  I just want to ask you to help me next Monday night. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=431.76s)]
*  By just going door to door, by meeting people. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=436.36s)]
*  Hi, Jimmy Carter. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=438.56s)]
*  I'm glad to meet you. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=439.56s)]
*  Fine. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=440.56s)]
*  I hope you'll go to the caucus next Monday night and help. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=441.56s)]
*  He understood that by doing that, you would build the kind of personal connection and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=443.4s)]
*  loyalty that you would need to get your voters to show up in the caucus system that we talked [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=447.52s)]
*  about and participate in this sort of back and forth. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=453.52s)]
*  I'm afraid I'm prejudiced because you're a farmer and I am a farmer. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  That's the kind of prejudice I like. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=460.88s)]
*  Well, I'm glad to meet you. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=462.6s)]
*  So lo and behold, Carter beat all the other candidates with a level of support that just [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=464.96s)]
*  shocked many Democrats with how well he did. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=471.4s)]
*  And people would look back on that and never forget the lesson of Iowa from 1976. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=474.6s)]
*  It shows that somebody who isn't really well known can use the state's nominating system [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=479.76s)]
*  to become a national figure in politics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=485.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=488.15999999999997s)]
*  Suddenly, Iowa, this kind of accidental first in the nation nominating contest, shows that [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=489.36s)]
*  it can be a decisive kingmaker because of course, that former peanut farmer, Jimmy Carter, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=497.16s)]
*  goes on to not only become the Democratic nominee, but to win the presidency itself. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=504.20000000000005s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=509.56s)]
*  And then Iowa showed again how it could help catapult a candidate to the front of the Democratic [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=510.56s)]
*  nominating process. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=522.96s)]
*  Well, listen, it is so fun to be here on a wonderful summer Saturday. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=524.28s)]
*  In this case, it was a relatively new senator from Illinois named Barack Obama. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=531.8s)]
*  I'm having a great time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=538.76s)]
*  Everybody's been so nice. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  What's important to remember about Obama that year was that certainly at the end of 2007, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=541.76s)]
*  leading into 2008, very few people thought that he could win the nomination. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=547.8s)]
*  Every dollar that we invest in early childhood education. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=552.56s)]
*  He was very untested. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=557.0s)]
*  If we invest a dollar, let me get some water, guys. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=559.72s)]
*  He was not frankly, at least early on, a particularly good candidate, as I can attest from watching [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  him in those early days. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=569.88s)]
*  You know what Japan does with Chinese when it comes to, for example, food importation? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=570.88s)]
*  He was a little aloof. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=576.36s)]
*  He was a little professorial. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=577.36s)]
*  All those raps on him that used to make him annoyed were kind of true. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=579.32s)]
*  But he took a page from Jimmy Carter. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=583.36s)]
*  How are you? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=585.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'm great. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=587.1600000000001s)]
*  And he spent months sort of going to all these small events in Iowa, in living rooms and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  churches. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=593.72s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=594.72s)]
*  Thank you for coming. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=595.72s)]
*  My name's Diana. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=596.72s)]
*  Hi, Diana. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=597.72s)]
*  Nice to meet you. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=598.72s)]
*  He spent a lot of time in that sort of period to learn what was important, to learn how [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=600.6s)]
*  to say what he believed. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=603.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=604.6s)]
*  And then... [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=605.6s)]
*  I love you back. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=606.6s)]
*  There was a very, very famous political dinner that is on the Iowa calendar. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=611.84s)]
*  And he went there and he just blew the roof off the place. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=617.44s)]
*  We can make this election not about fear, but about the future. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=622.1600000000001s)]
*  And that won't just be a Democratic victory. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=627.2s)]
*  That will be an American victory. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=629.9200000000001s)]
*  And that is a victory that America needs right now. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=632.02s)]
*  And it just totally, dramatically shifted the dynamics of the race. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=636.24s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=641.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=644.84s)]
*  And he went on to win. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=646.08s)]
*  It was candidate training school, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=650.64s)]
*  That's an important thing to remember about small states like Iowa. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=652.52s)]
*  That made him a better candidate. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=655.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=661.76s)]
*  And as I recall, Adam, during this period, there isn't much question that Iowa's place [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=662.76s)]
*  as first in the nation is locked in. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=666.12s)]
*  But questions do start to crop up more and more about whether Iowa being first is a good [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=668.44s)]
*  idea. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=673.6s)]
*  And I say that because by the next presidential election, 2012, I end up joining you in Iowa [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=675.16s)]
*  as a political reporter for the Times. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=680.44s)]
*  And I remember those questions becoming very top of mind. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=683.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of striking because Iowa, this overwhelmingly white state, had just [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=687.48s)]
*  voted for a black man to be the Democratic presidential nomination. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=692.64s)]
*  But it was hard to get around the fact that this state was not representative of the Democratic [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  Party. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=701.88s)]
*  That how much sense did it make to have a state like this be such a critical part of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=702.88s)]
*  the Democratic nominating process? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=707.76s)]
*  The other thing that was going on was that Iowa was slipping away from the Democratic [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=709.84s)]
*  Party in general elections. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=714.44s)]
*  There was a time when it was at least a purple state, a state that was in play. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=716.44s)]
*  But more and more, it was becoming a Republican state. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  The Democrats are still going through the motions of going there. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=723.8000000000001s)]
*  Every now and then you'll get a Democratic candidate who will say, I'm not going to campaign [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=726.24s)]
*  there and then they lose. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  So it became something that you just did because you did it, right? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  And then comes 2020. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  It is now about one o'clock in the morning in Iowa. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=738.04s)]
*  Results were supposed to be coming in hours ago. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=741.04s)]
*  And we see an implosion in Iowa's caucus system. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=744.16s)]
*  It still remains the biggest political mystery in the Democratic world right now. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  It's still right. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  There was this total meltdown. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  I was there. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=754.56s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=755.56s)]
*  Election officials in the state had tried to modernize the process by using an app to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=756.76s)]
*  report the results, but they hadn't really tested out the app beforehand and it just [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=761.4s)]
*  didn't work. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=766.12s)]
*  Some voters are frustrated, some of the candidates declaring victory despite not knowing the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=767.6s)]
*  winner. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=771.88s)]
*  And so things just totally failed that night. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=772.88s)]
*  The head of Iowa's Democratic Party tonight calling this system breakdown unacceptable. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=776.28s)]
*  As chair of the party, I apologize deeply for this. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=781.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=785.16s)]
*  And the state became a laughing stock, right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=786.16s)]
*  Iowa, how did you beef this? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=789.24s)]
*  You had four years to get ready and this was the result? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=792.44s)]
*  This is worse than the husband who comes home on Valentine's Day with a flower from the [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=795.24s)]
*  neighbor's yard, a bag of Skittles and a card that says sorry for your loss. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=799.12s)]
*  It took what, three weeks before they could find a side of winner. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=804.92s)]
*  The person who eventually did win the Iowa caucuses in fact was another fairly unknown [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=808.88s)]
*  candidate, a mayor from Indiana named Pete Buttigieg. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=813.08s)]
*  No one really thought he had a shot of actually winning the Democratic nomination and this [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=817.12s)]
*  time they were right. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=821.5600000000001s)]
*  Right in 2020, Iowa was the last thing from a kingmaker once all the counting was done. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=825.64s)]
*  Like you said, the person who won the nomination was Joe Biden, who, as I recall, placed fourth [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=832.12s)]
*  in Iowa. So the conclusion of just about every Democrat, except perhaps those who won the [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=837.0s)]
*  caucuses in Iowa, is that not only is Iowa incompetent when it comes to counting votes, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=843.04s)]
*  it's just totally out of sync with the rest of the party. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=848.5600000000001s)]
*  That's right, Michael. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=852.28s)]
*  And I think the other part of that was they realized that with few exceptions, Barack [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=853.0s)]
*  Obama being one, it had been out of sync for a long time. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=857.24s)]
*  I mean, for all the hype that reporters sort of invested in it, talking about how important [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=860.24s)]
*  it is, the fact of the matter is that like it was not a barometer of where the party [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=864.96s)]
*  was every now and then it lived up to its height, but more often than not it did not. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=869.92s)]
*  And then in 2020, it just was like this accumulation of all these reasons why enough already. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=874.0s)]
*  And that's how you get to this moment in Philadelphia, where the Democratic National [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=881.12s)]
*  Committee is about to close the door on the Iowa caucuses. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=885.72s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=898.96s)]
*  So, Adam, what exactly is the Democratic Party's proposal for replacing Iowa as the first [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=903.24s)]
*  nominating contest in the nation? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=909.52s)]
*  Well, so first of all, this is President Biden's idea and his recommendation to the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=911.72s)]
*  Democratic Committee. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=915.88s)]
*  So the plan that is being considered now would have South Carolina be the first state in [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=917.2s)]
*  the country to vote on the Democratic presidential candidates. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=922.44s)]
*  And what's the rationale for choosing South Carolina of all the possible options in the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=926.28s)]
*  country? Well, the top reason is because it is just more representative of the Democratic [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=931.84s)]
*  Party and more representative, I would argue, of the country. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=937.88s)]
*  It's got a much larger black population, and that makes a lot of sense to a party like [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=941.68s)]
*  the Democratic Party, where black voters are a big part of their base. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=946.8s)]
*  The second reason is that South Carolina holds a primary. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=950.08s)]
*  It's not a caucus, which means that the results will be more efficient and clearer. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=954.28s)]
*  You don't have the issue or you probably won't have the issue that we had in Iowa, where [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=958.8s)]
*  it just takes weeks to find out who actually won. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=963.4s)]
*  And I think all of that was very appealing to President Biden and the Democratic National [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=966.0799999999999s)]
*  Committee. Right. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  That all makes a certain sense. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  But it seems worth saying, Adam, that President Biden might have another reason to pick South [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=972.24s)]
*  Carolina, which is that it really resuscitated his 2020 candidacy, which was doing quite [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=976.28s)]
*  poorly in places like Iowa during the nomination process. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=982.9599999999999s)]
*  In fact, many people would argue that without South Carolina, Joe Biden could never have [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=986.8399999999999s)]
*  become a nominee or become president. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=991.8s)]
*  That's right. I think part of it. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=994.4399999999999s)]
*  Is that he's rewarding South Carolina for what happened in 2020. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=996.0s)]
*  But part of it is that this is something he's always believed that the Democratic Party [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=999.56s)]
*  was much more diverse and that the state like South Carolina represented it more. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1004.3199999999999s)]
*  So it's a combination of political pragmatism, rewarding a state that served him well, but [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1008.4s)]
*  just sort of understanding the way the party and the country is changing and that it made [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1013.8s)]
*  much more sense in his view, not only for him, but for the party to have the nomination [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1017.8s)]
*  start in a state that was as diverse as South Carolina. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1023.12s)]
*  Mm hmm. So, of course, I'm reminded of what happened in 1968 when the party was trying [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1027.2s)]
*  to fix a problem, that effort to fix a problem inevitably created a new problem, which was [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1034.56s)]
*  Iowa, this largely white state that had a lot of trouble counting votes. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1040.92s)]
*  Do Democrats fear that this new effort to solve a problem might create even newer problems? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1046.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think what you're referring to here is the law of unintended consequences, which [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1054.8s)]
*  is that anything a party does has some consequence that you and I can never imagine. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1059.1999999999998s)]
*  I'll tell you what I think is a fair thing to think about here. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1063.6399999999999s)]
*  There were problems with Iowa. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1066.9199999999998s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1068.36s)]
*  But there was something about it that allowed for the unexpected to happen. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1070.0s)]
*  And the obvious example is Jimmy Carter catapulting at the national stage or Barack Obama becoming [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1073.3999999999999s)]
*  the Barack Obama that we know. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1079.0s)]
*  And, you know, obviously, it doesn't happen with every candidate, but the possibility [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1080.84s)]
*  was always there. And I think that's what attracted Democrats to go there. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1084.4399999999998s)]
*  And I think we might lose that in a state like South Carolina. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1087.84s)]
*  Why? Why? Why? Why are we likely to lose that in South Carolina? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1091.52s)]
*  Well, a couple of reasons. One is South Carolina is a bigger state in terms of population. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1094.9199999999998s)]
*  There are two million more people in South Carolina. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1100.28s)]
*  So the idea of the kind of intimate campaigning, getting to know voters, getting to know [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1103.36s)]
*  issues that we saw in Iowa just can't happen in South Carolina. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1108.12s)]
*  And it's another point I would make about Iowa here. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1112.28s)]
*  It's a caucus. It's not a primary. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  And it requires a certain level of commitment on the part of voters because they have to [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1117.84s)]
*  turn out at a certain time for two hours on a Monday night and they have to stand up and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1123.9199999999998s)]
*  say why they're supporting who they're supporting or at least stand up and say they're [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1129.0s)]
*  supporting. So that requires a certain level of connection and commitment. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1131.96s)]
*  And a lot of candidates will tell you that that will only happen if you meet voters in [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1137.04s)]
*  person, not once, but several times. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1142.48s)]
*  Right. And that's a big part of the culture of Iowa. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1145.0s)]
*  And that's not going to be the case in South Carolina. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1147.2s)]
*  Even if you want to do it, it's just too big. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1150.0s)]
*  And that is the downside of South Carolina. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1152.92s)]
*  Fascinating. And what exactly do we think losing all of that might mean, practically [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1155.3600000000001s)]
*  speaking, for the candidates who seek the nomination? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1161.52s)]
*  If they don't achieve that level of intimacy with voters in a place like Iowa, what does [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1165.96s)]
*  it actually practically mean? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1171.04s)]
*  I mean, it might mean that the world is just changing and that people like me have been [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1173.6399999999999s)]
*  covering politics in the past and just get over it. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1176.76s)]
*  A candidate in Iowa can spend months building up, seeing coming in unknown and just [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1181.0s)]
*  methodically working his or her way around the across the state. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1186.0s)]
*  So by the end, they have name recognition. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1189.12s)]
*  Right. And they're a strong candidate, at least in terms of people knowing who they [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1191.12s)]
*  are. That's not going to be the case in South Carolina. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1193.84s)]
*  I think there's going to be a real premium on candidates coming in who have name recognition, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1196.8s)]
*  who are already known. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1203.6799999999998s)]
*  And that also means, right, candidates who have money, who can buy name recognition, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1205.1999999999998s)]
*  who can put their ads on television and get people to know who they are. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1210.4799999999998s)]
*  That's the price of being in South Carolina. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1214.9599999999998s)]
*  So the risk here is that this changed schedule might limit the type of candidate who has [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1217.2800000000002s)]
*  a serious chance of winning the Democratic nomination. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1223.96s)]
*  You're saying if that candidate doesn't have a lot of name recognition and a lot of money, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1227.2800000000002s)]
*  their chances now in this new system are just lower. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1232.16s)]
*  That's right. You know, politics is very random. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1236.2s)]
*  You never know what's going to happen. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1238.44s)]
*  I wouldn't rule it out completely, but it's going to be much harder for an unknown candidate [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1239.48s)]
*  to come from the back of the pack and all of a sudden win a primary because if you're [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1244.24s)]
*  not well known, you're going to need to have money to get known by voters. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1248.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's an obstacle. That's a real obstacle. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1252.08s)]
*  Right. But of course, the kind of candidate this change very clearly benefits is a [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1254.1999999999998s)]
*  candidate like Joe Biden. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1259.56s)]
*  Right. I mean, he's an incumbent president seeking reelection, we think. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1261.12s)]
*  And he has all these things that this schedule advantages. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1265.4399999999998s)]
*  Huge name recognition. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1269.32s)]
*  No one has more name recognition than the Senate president and a huge campaign war chest. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1270.48s)]
*  For the same reason, lots of Democrats have given lots of money to him, which is why some [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1274.24s)]
*  people no doubt see this new schedule as a kind of Biden incumbency protection program. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1278.52s)]
*  Yes, in a way. But I think you want to get Biden's do. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1285.56s)]
*  I'm not sure that's what's motivating him here. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1288.6s)]
*  I mean, I think that he really does believe that the system is unfair and doesn't [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1290.8799999999999s)]
*  represent the Democratic Party. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1293.96s)]
*  But, you know, I think he talked about reevaluating this every four years, considering [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1295.6s)]
*  how difficult it's been for this to happen. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1299.8s)]
*  It's the first time in what, 50 years? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1301.72s)]
*  I wouldn't count on that happening. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1303.76s)]
*  Let's just say that once it's done, it's done, at least for a couple of cycles. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1304.92s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1307.72s)]
*  It feels, Adam, that there's a certain kind of irony to where this is all landing, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1310.24s)]
*  because the party has been having this internal debate for decades now over who picks [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1315.8400000000001s)]
*  its nominee. And in 68, the decision was to take that power from party bosses, as you [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1321.8400000000001s)]
*  described it to us, and give it to Democratic Party voters. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1326.76s)]
*  But then the voters, they gave a lot of power to in places like Iowa, ended up being [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1330.32s)]
*  largely white and rural, which leads to this latest reform, again, over who picks the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1334.36s)]
*  nominee. And the answer this time is to open the door to a more diverse set of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1339.08s)]
*  voters that's more reflective of the party. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1343.36s)]
*  But in doing that, based on everything you just told us, we could end up with a system [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1346.04s)]
*  that leaves that more diverse set of voters with, and this is the irony part, less [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1351.6s)]
*  choice, right? Potentially fewer candidates, or at the very least, fewer kinds of [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1357.6s)]
*  candidates, right? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1363.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's exactly right. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1365.56s)]
*  And I think that that is a trade-off that the Democratic Party at this point is [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1367.44s)]
*  willing to make. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1373.32s)]
*  That it finds the idea of Iowa as the start of the nominating process so problematic [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1376.32s)]
*  that it is willing to make compromises like this in order to get a nominating process [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1383.4s)]
*  that starts in a state like South Carolina. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1389.0400000000002s)]
*  And we'll see what works. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1391.4s)]
*  It might work or might not, but it's a trade-off they're willing to make. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1392.5600000000002s)]
*  And if it doesn't work, they'll change it and we'll have you back. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1395.5600000000002s)]
*  That's right. I'll be back for the next one. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1398.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, Adam, thank you very much. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. I appreciate your time today. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1405.48s)]
*  It was a pleasure. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1407.4s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1413.16s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1431.76s)]
*  This is a family that lost their son and their brother through an act of violence [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1434.8000000000002s)]
*  at the hands and the feet of people who had been charged with keeping them safe. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1442.96s)]
*  In Memphis on Wednesday, Tyree Nichols, the 29-year-old who died after he was [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1451.64s)]
*  brutally beaten by police, was eulogized by members of his family and by Vice [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1457.36s)]
*  President Kamala Harris. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1463.76s)]
*  So when we talk about public safety, let us understand what it means in its [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1465.36s)]
*  truest form. Tyree Nichols should have been safe. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1473.6s)]
*  In emotional remarks, Nichols' mother and stepfather recalled the trauma of [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1480.04s)]
*  learning that their son had died at the hands of police and later watching video [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  footage that contradicted what officers said had happened at the scene. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1491.72s)]
*  When we got the news, it was very, very difficult. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1497.04s)]
*  It was surrounded by lies, deceit, trying to cover it up. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ybrXjBqFY&t=1503.8s)]
