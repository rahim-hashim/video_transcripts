# The Mysterious Gun Study That’s Advancing Gun Rights
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI5ev8TWAR0)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams.
*  This is The Daily.
*  On the previous episode of the show, we talked to a lawyer coming up with creative arguments
*  to get around laws favoring gun rights.
*  Today, my colleague Mike McIntyre on the mysterious study helping to strengthen gun rights around
*  the country and the person behind that study.
*  It's Thursday, June 20th.
*  So Mike, welcome to the show.
*  Tell me, how did you first get started with this reporting?
*  So I've been covering gun issues for quite some time.
*  And since the Supreme Court decision in 2022 in a case called New York State Rifle and
*  Pistol Association versus Bruin, that really changed the landscape of firearms litigation
*  in the country.
*  It was probably the most consequential Supreme Court Second Amendment case in decades.
*  And what it did was it really upended our previous understanding of the Second Amendment
*  by doing two things.
*  One is it for the first time found a Second Amendment right to carry a firearm outside
*  the home.
*  And then secondly, and most importantly, established a new test for gun restrictions and whether
*  or not they're in violation of the Second Amendment.
*  Essentially, Bruin opened a door for litigants to argue that if a gun is commonly used for
*  self-defense, it makes it harder to justify a law that would ban it.
*  We begin with some breaking news tonight out of the courts.
*  A major blow to gun control.
*  So as a result of the Bruin test that was created, you have seen this tsunami of litigation
*  take place across the country.
*  A Texas judge has ruled that people under felony indictments are allowed to carry guns.
*  A Virginia judge has struck down federal laws banning the sale of handguns to adults younger
*  than 21.
*  In Washington state, a ban on high capacity magazines just ruled unconstitutional.
*  You have many, many court cases happening attempting to knock down these gun restrictions.
*  A federal judge has overturned California's three decade old ban on assault weapons.
*  So in the course of looking at these hundreds of lawsuits, one thing stood out to me, which
*  was somewhat surprising.
*  I started seeing the same name over and over again, which I had not recognized before.
*  It was a university professor named William English who had conducted a survey of gun
*  owners in 2021.
*  Well, we look at the evidence available and we've basically put forward three buckets
*  of evidence to this court.
*  That survey has been cited repeatedly in these lawsuits.
*  In the Bill English data, over 60% said they own them for self-defense.
*  His name was showing up over and over again.
*  Special William English, the Bill English survey data that is...
*  Legal briefs and motions, oral arguments and appellate courts.
*  We've put in the record that 64% of the people who own these plus 10 magazines have bought
*  them for the purposes of self-defense.
*  Was there a survey that...
*  There was a survey, Your Honor.
*  And I was intrigued, mainly because I had never heard of them before.
*  And what exactly did the study say?
*  What made the study interesting and important was, first of all, the scope of it.
*  It was the largest of its kind in many, many years, probably since the 1990s.
*  He surveyed over 16,000 gun owners and asked several key questions.
*  So one of them was trying to find out how often gun owners use their firearms for self-defense.
*  And then two other questions dealt with whether or not they own AR-15 rifles, commonly referred
*  to sometimes as assault weapons, or high capacity magazines, which are magazines that hold 10
*  or more rounds.
*  And those are kind of the central parts of the survey.
*  And what was the overall finding from the study?
*  Did it tell us how many people were actually using guns, how frequently, how common?
*  So the study found a few things.
*  One was that gun owners reported using their guns for self-defense approximately 1.7 million
*  times a year.
*  Wow.
*  In terms of the types of firearms that people like to own, it also found that AR-15s and
*  high capacity magazines are popular.
*  And just by coincidence, those three areas are ones that are very important to the gun
*  lobby as litigation campaign.
*  So if you, for instance, are able to show that they are what the court considers to
*  be in common use for lawful purposes, then that also makes it harder to make the claim
*  that they should somehow be banned or restricted.
*  So these lawyers all over the country are citing a study that really bolsters the case
*  that these semi-automatic weapons are common, that they often have high capacity magazines,
*  that they're basically used over and over again in self-defense, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it really serves the gun rights arguments pretty well, these findings.
*  And that caused me to take a closer look at just what the survey was about and who Dr.
*  Walsh was.
*  I had never heard of him before, as I mentioned, because I've written about gun issues for
*  quite some time and the universe of firearms scholars is actually pretty small.
*  Many of them I talked to were unfamiliar with him as well.
*  So there was just a little bit of a mystery here as to where he came from and what the
*  origins of this survey was.
*  So I started to look more into how the survey was done.
*  And one thing that was curious to me was the survey had not been published in a peer-reviewed
*  journal, which is not required, but it certainly lends credibility and strength to your findings
*  if you were to do that.
*  Instead it was uploaded to a website where basically anybody can upload an unpublished
*  academic paper.
*  He also didn't disclose the source of funding for it, which again is not required, but it's
*  pretty standard in academic circles.
*  So at this point, Mike, you're seeing some issues around transparency that are raising
*  some alarm bells, but you're not really sure what to make of it yet, it sounds like.
*  Yeah, I think that's true.
*  I mean, it just raised more questions for me.
*  So one way to kind of really get a handle on what the survey says and how it was conducted
*  is to look at the raw data.
*  So somewhere there has to be a file with all of the questions that were asked and the responses
*  from people.
*  But he did not post the raw data along with his papers until about two years later.
*  I went looking for it and I did manage to locate it and download it and looked at it
*  myself.
*  And what did you find?
*  Well, a couple of things really kind of stood out.
*  One was the questions that were asked of the respondents were phrased differently than
*  how he portrayed them in the papers he wrote about his results.
*  So in the papers that he posted to this website explaining the findings of the survey, he
*  would describe the question asked as, for instance, have you ever used your gun for
*  self-defense or have you ever owned an AR-15?
*  But the actual questions that were presented to the respondents had a little preamble or
*  an introduction which was not described in his papers.
*  And I'll give you an example.
*  The question of have you ever used your gun for self-defense, that was actually preceded
*  said, many policymakers recognize that a large number of people participate in shooting sports
*  but question how often guns are used for self-defense.
*  Oh, wow.
*  There was a similar lack of transparency on another question that was asked about high-capacity
*  magazines.
*  And it started out by saying, you know, some have argued that few people actually want
*  or use high-capacity magazines.
*  And answering this will help us establish how popular these magazines are.
*  But phrasing was not included in the papers that he posted describing his survey findings.
*  The reason that's important is because social scientists will tell you that the phrasing
*  of the questions is crucial to determining how someone's going to answer.
*  And if you start off by sort of giving a little preamble that implies that there are forces
*  out there who might question how often you really use your gun or want your gun, it has
*  the potential to skew the results in a certain direction.
*  And in addition to that, there were just a couple of other things I found curious in
*  looking at the raw data.
*  I mean, one was the very broad definition he used of what it means to defend yourself
*  with a gun that allowed for, for instance, situations in which somebody didn't even show
*  the gun or maybe even just told someone they had a gun.
*  And also it didn't specify what timeframe you may have done this.
*  So typically, if you're trying to figure out what the current state of events is for defensive
*  gun use, you might ask, have you ever done it in the past year or past two years or whatever?
*  This basically asked if you've ever done it in your lifetime.
*  So you could have somebody who may have used a gun for self-defense back in the 1970s,
*  and that counts.
*  Oh, wow.
*  There was similar phrasing of questions, for instance, about whether you've ever owned
*  an AR-15.
*  And again, it was allowing people to count whether they had one 10, 20, 30 years ago,
*  and maybe not today.
*  So what does this say about the actual numbers in the study?
*  So the figure I mentioned of 1.67 million defensive gun uses a year, you know, when
*  talking to other experts on this, I mean, that is definitely on the high end of the
*  range.
*  There are other studies that put the number as less than 100,000 times a year.
*  That's quite a range.
*  Right.
*  And this is where the methodology becomes important because the way the survey is conducted,
*  the way the questions are asked, all of that affects the results.
*  So Mike, you find the study, it's showing up in gun cases all over the country where
*  people are trying to overturn state gun laws.
*  But it also seems like you're seeing some red flags with how the survey was actually
*  conducted.
*  So at this point, tell me what you're thinking.
*  Well, I'm thinking pretty specifically, I need to know a lot more about this survey.
*  Who financed it and who is Dr. English?
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Mike, what did you find out about Dr. William English?
*  So he's a political scientist and economist at Georgetown University.
*  He was a research fellow at Harvard for a few years before joining Georgetown in 2016.
*  He had a fairly established track record of published papers on issues of social science,
*  the humanities, ethics and public policy.
*  His studies have focused a lot on behavioral issues and what incentives are for people
*  to behave in certain ways.
*  And that's part of what his academic background is.
*  So it doesn't sound like he has much of a track record on gun issues specifically.
*  Right, at least publicly, there's nothing which indicates he had done research on guns,
*  which made his debut with his survey just a little bit unusual.
*  So I wanted to find out more about how he got involved with that.
*  And the most obvious way to do that is to try to talk to him.
*  So I emailed him.
*  I didn't hear anything back, so I emailed him again.
*  I got no response.
*  I tried calling his office at Georgetown.
*  I found his cell phone number.
*  Yeah, hi, Bill.
*  This is Mike Mackenshire at the New York Times.
*  Call that, left a message.
*  I've been trying to get a hold of you.
*  I'm just working on a story about Second Amendment litigation.
*  I want to talk to you about your...
*  Nothing.
*  I texted him.
*  I didn't get a response.
*  Maybe he pointed me in the right direction.
*  I was trying to get in touch with Professor Bill English.
*  I visited his office at Georgetown University.
*  He wasn't there.
*  And I finally decided just to visit his house.
*  And so I walked up the front door, rang the bell, waited, but there was no response.
*  Wow.
*  And, you know, I wasn't the only one having difficulty getting him to talk about the survey.
*  I've discovered in court records that the state of Washington, who they were being sued
*  by a gun rights group which had cited Dr. English's survey and lawyers for the state
*  had tried to talk to him as well about the survey.
*  They emailed him.
*  They tried to call him.
*  They sent a certified letter.
*  And eventually they issued a subpoena to try to get him to respond.
*  And at some point, faced with the possibility that the court was going to compel his testimony,
*  the plaintiffs in that case agreed to withdraw all references to his research from their
*  case in order to not have him submit the questions.
*  This was starting to seem very strange to me.
*  I mean, you've rarely heard of an academic who isn't eager to talk about their work.
*  And in this particular case, especially, it was something that was gaining such influence
*  and traction in the world of litigation.
*  So there are just sort of a lot of things to which we're raising questions in my mind
*  about why is he so reluctant to talk about this?
*  So at this point, it sounds like you're kind of at a reporting dead end, at least when
*  it comes to getting Dr. English to explain his work to you and how he conducted the survey.
*  Yes.
*  We did find one instance where Dr. English did discuss his work publicly.
*  Smith and Wesson sales plummet, plus a conversation with Georgetown professor William English
*  on his groundbreaking research.
*  It was on this podcast called The Reload, which is a firearms news site.
*  Can you just tell people a little bit more about yourself before we begin?
*  Yeah, Stephen, thank you for having me.
*  So I'm a professor at Georgetown in our business school.
*  And on the podcast, he says that his survey was part of research he was doing for a book
*  project.
*  So where are the most interesting differences in our assessment of sort of current gun use,
*  current gun abuse, gun ownership trends?
*  He hasn't published the book yet.
*  He does talk about his methodology.
*  If anything, I think this is a conservative estimate because...
*  Right, yeah, actually, let's talk about that real quick.
*  Actually says he thinks his estimate for self-defense may be a bit conservative.
*  Thank you so much for joining us.
*  Again, we'll have to have you back on once you're closer to the published date on that
*  book.
*  Great.
*  Well, thank you, Steve, for having me.
*  Great to have this conversation.
*  But one thing I didn't talk about was how the research was funded.
*  And it's a pretty standard thing in the social science research to disclose that because
*  studies like this are not cheap.
*  So I kept digging into the records I could find.
*  And looking at case files, I discovered something which I had not previously known and was not
*  widely publicly known, which is that Dr. English has served as a paid expert witness for pro-gun
*  plaintiffs in at least four cases before he'd done the survey.
*  So he might not actually be as impartial of a researcher as he presents himself to be.
*  Well, you know, it's not uncommon for academic scholars to serve as witnesses in lawsuits
*  for one side or the other.
*  But here with these cases, he was serving as a paid expert for the pro-gun side of the
*  litigation.
*  And there was one case in particular which became important.
*  It was in 2019 in Vermont.
*  And an NRA-backed group was challenging a state ban on high-capacity magazines.
*  And they wanted to do a survey of Vermont gun owners to find out how common those high-capacity
*  magazines were.
*  And so in order to do the survey, they hired Dr. English to do it.
*  He produced an expert report for them saying that high-capacity magazines are popular and
*  commonly used for self-defense.
*  Now he would say later in a deposition that he was paid $20,000 to do the survey in the
*  Vermont case.
*  The reason that's important is because when he produced his national survey in 2021, he
*  described that earlier Vermont survey as proof of concept for the national survey.
*  What he doesn't say is that Vermont survey was actually commissioned by pro-gun plaintiffs
*  in an NRA-backed lawsuit.
*  That's a pretty important point to note, but that's not explained in his national survey,
*  which he did later.
*  So now you're starting to form a real picture of where some of Dr. English's funding is
*  coming from.
*  Yeah.
*  It still didn't help me understand, though, how the national firearm survey that he did
*  was funded.
*  So to try to get a better understanding of that, I went back to the court record and
*  looked at one of the filings that Dr. English did with a group called the Center for Human
*  Liberty.
*  It was an organization that joined with him in filing a court brief.
*  And I just was curious about what that organization was.
*  It sounds like a very lofty goal, the Center for Human Liberty.
*  It turns out that it was created just a couple of months before it appeared with him in this
*  court filing.
*  Oh, wow.
*  It has no staff.
*  It uses for a physical address a virtual office provider in Las Vegas.
*  And the whole thing just turned out to be basically kind of a phantom organization.
*  It turned out that this thing was funded and created by the founders of the Firearms Policy
*  Coalition, which is a very aggressive litigation group behind a lot of the lawsuits that we
*  in courts trying to overturn gun restrictions.
*  And that got me into the world of what's often referred to as dark money, the world of nonprofit
*  advocacy groups whose funding sources are often very opaque or anonymous.
*  And in digging into this, I eventually discovered yet another group called the Constitutional
*  Defense Fund, which is, again, a type of group that seems to have come out of nowhere.
*  It's not clear who runs it.
*  Its address is a UPS store in Virginia.
*  But looking at its tax filings, which are public, I was able to see that it received
*  big infusions of money from somewhere in the lead up to the Supreme Court's Bruin case
*  and dispersed that money as payments to a number of interesting recipients.
*  The law firm that had paid Dr. English for his Vermont survey work, a board member of
*  the NRA, the Firearms Policy Coalition, and interestingly, a grant to Dr. English himself
*  for $58,000.
*  Wow.
*  That was a very interesting revelation because this is a pro-gun group, the Constitutional
*  Defense Fund, that lists one of its causes as Second Amendment defense.
*  And here it was paying money to Dr. English right around the time that he was doing his
*  national survey.
*  Now, because he's not talking to me, I can't ask him anything about that.
*  But I did go to Georgetown University to see if they had any knowledge of it.
*  They said they didn't, but they did make the point that as a faculty member, he can do
*  research projects on his own.
*  So Mike, you're finding all of these connections, some of which seem kind of indirect, maybe
*  a little bit obfuscated between Dr. English and some of these gun groups.
*  But do we know if the money helped to actually fund Dr. English's national survey?
*  It's unclear whether it played a direct role in the survey.
*  And it's important to point out, of course, that the source of funding by itself doesn't
*  necessarily mean there's anything wrong with the survey.
*  But let's face it, there's a reason why you'd want to know who paid for it.
*  I mean, whenever you do a survey like this, there are assumptions and choices that are
*  made about the framing of questions, the order in which they're asked, how the sample of
*  respondents is selected, the methodology used to make sense of the findings.
*  And even the smallest decisions one way or the other on those types of issues can skew
*  the results.
*  Right.
*  There's a reason why researchers, academics typically disclose the source of their funding
*  in papers or reports or other things that they put out.
*  Right.
*  And there's one other thing that we do know about the funding, and that is that among
*  the payments that this pro-gun group had made was an $80,000 payment to a law firm that
*  helped write and file an amicus brief in the Supreme Court's Bruin case for Dr. English.
*  And it's important because an amicus brief is what they call a friend of the court filing.
*  And it's, in this case, designed to support the legal arguments being made by the plaintiffs
*  before the Supreme Court.
*  And this was the first time that his national firearm survey appeared in a court proceeding.
*  Now there are lots of amicus filings in Supreme Court cases.
*  I don't think anyone can say that an amicus brief by itself has ever turned the tide in
*  a Supreme Court decision.
*  But the scholarship and the legal arguments in these briefs are paid attention to and
*  given weight.
*  And the case of Dr. English, it did carry a lot of weight because it was cited in at
*  least five briefs that were filed in that case.
*  We will hear argument this morning in case 2843, New York State.
*  And Dr. English and his research were invoked during oral arguments.
*  I think the people of good moral character who start drinking a lot can get pretty angry
*  at each other.
*  And if they each have a concealed weapon, who knows?
*  Justice Stephen Breyer, who is one of the court's liberal justices, raised the concern
*  that by eliminating these restrictions it's going to lead to more violence on the streets.
*  What are we supposed to say in your opinion that is going to be clear enough that we
*  will not produce a kind of gun related chaos?
*  So, Justice Breyer, I would sort of point you to two things that maybe...
*  And the plaintiff's attorney referred him to Dr. English's brief as a counterpoint.
*  Well...
*  If you want to look at the empirical evidence, and I know, Justice Breyer, you asked about
*  this, please also look at the English brief on the top side because it's a very rigorous
*  statistic.
*  And it also was cited by Justice Samuel Alito and his concurring opinion.
*  So it's inarguably an instance in which this particular ambiguous filing did get the attention
*  of people involved in that case.
*  Why do you think that the court failed to give this study and Dr. English the kind of
*  scrutiny that you did?
*  Well, you know, my colleague on this story, Jody Cantor, has looked into this as well.
*  And there really is no mechanism in the Supreme Court to vet things like this.
*  And there's a couple of reasons for that.
*  One is that there's a presumption that by the time a case gets to the Supreme Court
*  level, evidentiary issues have already been worked out somewhere in the lower courts.
*  But that's not the case with amicus briefs.
*  Amicus briefs could contain opinions and information from almost anybody.
*  There really is no system in the high court to analyze that, to vet it and figure out
*  how legitimate it is.
*  But you know, after the Bruin ruling and after the study was cited by a Supreme Court justice,
*  we do see a big increase in the number of times Dr. English's research shows up in
*  lower court cases.
*  So I think that the attention that was given to his work in the Supreme Court case helped
*  propel his findings into the litigation campaign that followed the Bruin case.
*  So this kind of seems like it's bringing us full circle.
*  This study that has these issues that you've uncovered is helping gun advocates overturn
*  gun laws all over the country, not by working its way up to the court system and all these
*  smaller cases, but by actually walking through the front door at the Supreme Court, the highest
*  court in the land, and getting the rubber stamp from one of the justices even.
*  That's right.
*  So I'm curious, Mike, at the end of the day, where does the responsibility lie for keeping
*  a study like this out of the courts and potentially becoming integral to changing gun laws?
*  Well, I think in the end, the story of Dr. English and his survey is really the logical
*  culmination of a decades-long effort by the gun lobby to change our understanding of the
*  Second Amendment in such a way that it allows for this kind of litigation to proceed, knocking
*  down gun restrictions across the country.
*  Because of Bruin, courts are having to make these decisions based on things like historical
*  precedent and statistical analysis.
*  And since judges aren't experts on these things, they turn to scholarship.
*  And some of this scholarship, it turns out, has ties to pro-gun interests.
*  And so you have courts making their decisions based on information of uncertain provenance,
*  if you will, and all of it is the product of this decades-long campaign by gun advocacy
*  groups.
*  So you're likely to see more and more of these kinds of academic papers and research and
*  legal arguments being made because that's sort of the new territory of where we find
*  ourselves.
*  So there might be more studies like this and more gun scholars like Dr.
*  English in the future.
*  Most definitely.
*  Well, Mike, thank you so much.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know about the Second Amendment.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un signed a mutual
*  assistance pact.
*  The deal revives a Cold War-era agreement that requires each country to defend the other
*  against outside aggression.
*  And it's the strongest signal yet that the agreement among the world's strongest nuclear
*  powers to curb North Korea's nuclear program has fizzled.
*  And...
*  Here's the pistol, Willie.
*  Swung on and saved the world.
*  That one is way back, way back, way back.
*  Well, let's goodbye number 600 for Willie Mays.
*  The legendary giant center fielder Willie Mays died on Tuesday at age 93.
*  Number 600 for Mays.
*  He hit it over the 370 foot mark.
*  A standing ovation here in San Diego for Willie.
*  Known as the Say Hey Kid, he was among the first generation of Black players to play
*  in Major League Baseball in the 1950s.
*  He was brilliant at every part of the game.
*  At the plate, in the field, rounding the bases.
*  Some even said he was the greatest baseball player of all time.
*  The game of baseball has been great to me.
*  I have just about everything I need.
*  The only thing that I'm looking for out of baseball now is that I can teach other kids
*  to be as great an athlete as I was in my day.
