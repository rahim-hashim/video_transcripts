# Trump Wins Making Sense of Election Night
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vifCRtfl6ww)
*  It is nearly 1.30 a.m. on the morning after Election Day.
*  It's been a really long night.
*  It's going to be a really long morning.
*  And we are going to head into the studio and unpack everything that we know and don't know
*  about their results.
*  I'm Michael Bobarro, and this is The Daily.
*  So Astead, Nate, Lisa, thank you for being here at 1.25 a.m.
*  Thank you for having us.
*  I deeply appreciate it.
*  The night's still young for us.
*  It is.
*  But at this moment, it is looking very likely that Donald Trump will be the winner of this
*  election and that he will return to the White House.
*  So I just want to take a moment and have you all reflect on the significance of that reality,
*  that Trump is now exceedingly likely to have a second term in the White House.
*  Lisa?
*  Well, this is a huge accomplishment.
*  I mean, I've been thinking about how, in a way, Trump is his own historic first.
*  We talk a lot about barrier breaking candidates and Vice President Harris would have been
*  the first female president.
*  Trump of course will be the first convicted felon and twice impeached president.
*  He'll be the first president in more than 120 years to come back after losing a reelection
*  bid.
*  So he is breaking boundaries in his way.
*  And of course, then there's all the things that he promised during the course of his
*  As we've talked about before on this roundtable, seem to flout, if not directly at, some core
*  principles of the country's founding system of democracy.
*  So it does feel like we're headed to a pretty extraordinary and unprecedented second term
*  for Trump and for the nation.
*  Let's get your reaction.
*  I think that in 2016, you could have told yourself that America didn't know what it
*  was selecting.
*  And I think now you can't.
*  It's not just his literal return.
*  It is the fact that he has been so explicit in the run up to that return.
*  The convictions, the sexual assault liability, you can go on and on and on, but there's not
*  a lack of evidence on who Donald Trump is and what he is promising.
*  And so I think that that is the thing that largely sits with me.
*  And I think on the other side, the democratic refusal to see the unpopularity of Joe Biden,
*  the dismissal of anyone who talked about a primary, the demanding of party loyalty, all
*  of that looks ridiculous.
*  And the national picture that shows a consistent desire for change, I think has to be read
*  as first and foremost, a rejection of the current administration.
*  And there was a lot of signs that pointed to that for a long time.
*  And so in the same way, I think there is an active embrace of Donald Trump you can ignore.
*  I think you also have to point out that the strategy that Democrats took, the self belief
*  that they had, that they were certain of, has put them in this situation.
*  We're going to return to that for sure, Ested, in a little bit.
*  The soul searching within the Democratic Party, all the decision making around Biden.
*  But first, Nate, your quick reaction before we get into the question of how we actually
*  got here tonight.
*  Well, Ested took what might have been the gist of mine.
*  So I'll offer a slightly, I'll zig where others zagged and just reflect on the potentially
*  extraordinary consequences of a second Trump term on almost every major issue that there
*  has been consensus on in the United States since World War II, whether it's foreign policy
*  or immigration or trade, norms for constitutional government.
*  Now a majority or near majority of Americans will elect someone who potentially in the
*  most radical ways will try and overturn that consensus.
*  Nate, just how much of a victory does this appear to be for Trump?
*  How close was this?
*  By most measures, it's still going to be a fairly close election.
*  It should be noted he is favored to win the popular vote, which is extraordinary given
*  that he lost the last two times that no Republican has won it in 20 years.
*  But he may only win it by a point or two.
*  Biden won it by four and a half.
*  We didn't consider that to be a landslide.
*  He's probably going to sweep all the swing states, but that would put him just over 300
*  electoral votes, not 370 like Obama.
*  So you can't call it a landslide, but it's a clear victory.
*  Okay, I want to talk about how Trump pulled this off.
*  And Nate, I want to stick with you because you were on the show yesterday outlining various
*  scenarios for the outcome of this race.
*  And the one that appears to have played out is what you identified as, and correct me
*  if I'm wrong, the Trump realignment scenario.
*  A pretty significant set of gains that extend and you could argue complete this populist
*  that he began back in 2016.
*  When I look at the map on the Times homepage that shows the differences between 2020 and
*  tonight, it actually seems in a way to be bigger than that what Trump did because that
*  map shows that between those two elections, the country moved right, it would seem across
*  the board.
*  And on top of that, that map shows pretty much nothing broke Kamala Harris's way.
*  How did that happen based on what we know so far from the data?
*  On a spectrum between a close 2020 repeat and a realignment, I would put it somewhere
*  in the middle.
*  But yes, this is a decisive victory and it's noteworthy that it was very broad.
*  There are very few parts of the country where Harris ran as well as Joe Biden.
*  There are very few demographic groups where Harris ran as well as Joe Biden.
*  There were places that are traditionally liberal that swung, conservative places, Hispanic
*  places, white working class, every kind of county swung towards Donald Trump.
*  That says a lot about the deep-seated revulsion that was being expressed here at the status
*  quo.
*  This is very different to me than 2016 where there was this narrow Trump breakthrough among
*  white college graduates that let him get over the top in the critical Midwestern battleground
*  states by a hair.
*  This is a much more comfortable and broadly based victory.
*  I do think it counts as the culmination of the broader Trump era of elections.
*  He started in 2016 with this narrow breakthrough and now he has extended what had been a narrow
*  coalition to something that is hardly, we're still again talking about a relatively modest
*  victory, but one that is still fundamentally much more broadly based than it once was.
*  Again, we've now changed what American politics is about in some way.
*  We have a new political division in the country and there are a lot of different people in
*  demographic groups that previously did not support Donald Trump who appear to be receptive
*  to different elements of that message.
*  Can you explain what you mean or any of you when you say we're never going back?
*  Well I think there's definitely a political realignment.
*  For a long time we had this Obama era of politics where demographics would be destiny and a
*  more diversifying nation would definitely go towards Democrats and that was the belief.
*  We're seeing, granted it's still early, that that is not what's necessarily going to happen.
*  Something very different appears to be happening.
*  So we're entering, I sort of see it as ending one political era in terms of the politics
*  and entering another one, but I think there's a larger, slightly more philosophical question
*  as well which is there was this sense that Trump was an aberration in some way, that
*  he was a deviation from American politics and his term and his win was a deviation and
*  all these things he did, be it stoking January 6th or refusing to accept the results of the
*  2020 election or even just how he talked about people.
*  Those things are not an aberration in our politics.
*  Those things are our politics now and that's where I think the country is and that I think
*  is what a lot of people probably tomorrow morning are going to have to confront.
*  Nate, you just mentioned how much success Donald Trump had with a variety of voting blocks
*  that, as Lisa, you just pointed out, Democrats had long believed were going to remain loyal
*  to them.
*  And, but why?
*  But why?
*  Why?
*  Why did they believe that?
*  Like, that evidence has been clear about the drop off for a long time, right?
*  Like, we've had 2016, we've had 2020, like we've actually had a lot of evidence to say
*  that the demographic destiny undertone is one that is a faulty premise.
*  The fact that they are holding on to the Obama era, in my opinion, is a racist assumption.
*  I don't mean it like in a capital R way, but I mean it in a-
*  It's a race based assumption.
*  I mean, I think it's, I would say lower case racist.
*  I would say that there is an assumption that this, it was a failure of imagination, that
*  it couldn't be true.
*  Yeah, I hear you.
*  But I think there is a sense of like, yes, we saw this drumbeat coming.
*  We saw that more people were identifying as Republicans in like all these polls.
*  We saw that Democrats had moved towards the more conservative position on issues like
*  immigration.
*  We saw that representation did not motivate people of color.
*  We saw that representation isn't enough.
*  But at the same time-
*  You're saying having a black candidate.
*  Yeah, people don't vote just on representation.
*  There's another half of this though, which is that Democrats lost sight of why they were
*  winning voters like this in the first place.
*  Thank you.
*  Preach, Dan.
*  Which is?
*  The main reason that I think is worth mentioning is the economy and helping working people
*  against the establishment and corporations.
*  It was the Democrats who used to be the party that was advocating change that was against
*  the establishment that could channel the emotions of a disaffected young person.
*  Donald Trump is that candidate.
*  And so they should in no way be surprised that they have lost those people.
*  I just want to make sure I understand what I think you're all hinting at, which is that
*  Donald Trump and the Republican Party have completed a journey in which they are the
*  party of disruption.
*  They are the party that assaults the establishment.
*  They are the party that says not just to the white working class, but to the working class
*  in a number of different demographic groups, including black and Latino working class Americans,
*  that we are your refuge from an unfair broken system.
*  And I would only add their ability to do that was made easier by a Democratic Party
*  who seated the mantle on that front.
*  Absolutely.
*  The biggest character in this race to me was not on the ballot in 2020.
*  It was Joe Biden, in my opinion.
*  Like Joe Biden's refusal to do what he implied he would do in 2020 and transition to a different
*  type of generation, allow Democrats to have a broader conversation about change, allow
*  Democrats to be freed from the status quo is not what happened.
*  I think it would be easier for me to say that Donald Trump completed this mass realignment
*  among the working class if we had a universe where the Democrats had a primary, where the
*  Democrats nominated a candidate that was based around some set of ideas and it was not tied
*  to this image in this administration so clearly and the status quo.
*  But since that is not what happened, I think it has made the Republican ability to be the
*  agents of change so much easier that I find it the biggest thing that has happened in
*  this race.
*  To what we're saying about what's happened over the last three months, the place that
*  they were in before the candidate switch happened made it such that you could run a perfect
*  race or whatever and you are still playing on ground that brings you to 50-50 because
*  the biggest thing, in my opinion, that happened was they tied themselves to an unpopular administration
*  and with it the status quo.
*  That did not represent change.
*  And there was a lot of evidence that that was a bad idea.
*  I want to turn to what happened with women in tonight's election.
*  It seemed, despite everything we're talking about here, like the Harris campaign was relying
*  on women to save the Democratic coalition and the view was suburban women, even moderate
*  Republican women, post the overturning of Roe v. Wade and given all of Donald Trump's
*  character flaws was going to put Kamala Harris over the edge despite the fact that perhaps
*  she didn't speak to and embody change in the way that so many other Americans wanted.
*  Did those women not show up or did they show up but it didn't matter because of all the
*  other voters who showed up for Trump?
*  So it's a little hard to say at this point.
*  Men and women live together in all precincts, it turns out, so it's a little hard to separate
*  that out.
*  We can say something about the power of abortion rights since Dobbs in 2022 that had been such
*  a motivator for Democrats.
*  And I think now maybe even because of all the state referendums, you had a sense that
*  voters could support both abortion rights and former President Trump.
*  And that was different than what we had seen in the 2022 midterms.
*  So I wonder if the power of that issue was a little diminished in some way.
*  I would also only add, and this is anecdotal of course, but a lot of folks we met in our
*  travels understood Donald Trump is having a different position on abortion than the
*  rest of the Republican party.
*  And one thing that Donald Trump, in the last year and a half, he's created distance from
*  the most evangelical wing of Republicans, he has upset some of them.
*  And I think we have to acknowledge, I think some of that worked.
*  In other words, people did not buy the idea that he was a true believer in the opposition
*  to abortion.
*  I guess I'm not saying that.
*  I'm just saying the idea that abortion had to be placed top of your list because Republicans
*  represented an existential threat to that right, I have had people articulate to me
*  how that does not apply to Donald Trump.
*  People have mentioned consistently that Donald Trump is different than other Republicans
*  on abortion rights.
*  Now I would also say that I think there is some failure of imagination on behalf of
*  voters about Donald Trump.
*  I think that folks don't have that feeling and it not be true.
*  He's still wrapped up in the conservative ecosystem that is anti-abortion.
*  I just think we have to acknowledge, since we're talking about gender, that in two of
*  the last three presidential races, a woman running against Donald Trump lost.
*  This race meant a lot as Hillary Clinton's campaign against Trump meant a lot to women.
*  And I wonder what happens now.
*  What we saw in 2016 was obviously the women's march and everyone got out with their hats
*  and then you saw this flourishing of the Me Too movement that prompted this really public
*  and private reckoning around gender and gender equity.
*  And then you saw all these women run and succeed.
*  In 2018, you had record breaking numbers of women elected to Congress.
*  In 2019, you had six women and unprecedented number run for the presidency.
*  So much so that Biden promised to pick a woman, he selected Harris and put her in as vice
*  president.
*  And now after all of that, this movement that seemed like it was building towards the White
*  House, in fact, it wasn't.
*  And I just don't think anyone's going to be out marching with their little pink hats this
*  time around.
*  I think the reaction will be something different, but I don't know.
*  I don't know what it will be.
*  I agree.
*  This is one of the best questions about what happens next is what is the visceral emotional
*  response from what eight years ago was called the resistance.
*  But broadly speaking, from liberals and college graduates, the sort of groups that have powered
*  democratic successes and midterms and special elections.
*  I personally don't see how it could be the same.
*  Having him win again and like this is going to hit very differently.
*  And there's also a sort of natural exhaustion, I think, to this sort of response to Trump
*  over time that I felt I personally thought I observed in this campaign, and it was reflected
*  in the data as well, in terms of lower voter registration and so on.
*  I don't know what will be the reaction in an emotional way for the democratic activist
*  rank and file.
*  I think we need to wrestle with some of the realities of Donald Trump's weaknesses.
*  And Nate, whenever we've talked to you in the past, you spoke of whether it was Trump's
*  role in January 6th, his convictions in the hush money scheme, not to mention the tax
*  fraud, his increasingly racist, race baiting rhetoric, which we really saw at the end of
*  this campaign at some of his rallies, as his single biggest vulnerabilities.
*  And I want to understand in your mind if a victory here means that voters were looking
*  past those things or if as in 2016, but obviously the facts on the ground are different, we
*  need to see this as part of the appeal of what voters liked about Donald Trump this
*  time around.
*  I think that voters have never liked Donald Trump.
*  But I have to say he's a lot more popular today than he was in 2016.
*  In 2016, you know, his unfavorable rating was like, rather his favorable rating was
*  like 30%, 35%.
*  Now it's close to 50%.
*  A lot of people who didn't like him eight years ago, they've come around to him.
*  That is partly because I think he ran a much more disciplined campaign than he did eight
*  years ago.
*  I think it's partly because he's become normalized for lack of a better world.
*  He's something we're all accustomed to.
*  And he has positive attributes as well, whether it's his economic, his perceived economic
*  stewardship or that people think he's funny and so on, and that he's not politically correct.
*  And those, that those combination of things can lead someone to come around to him and
*  look past his liabilities.
*  That said, I still don't think that on net, Trump is a strong candidate.
*  I think that the balance of his strengths and weaknesses at best cancel out and may
*  well be on net worse than a different Republican candidate.
*  That's not to say they would have won in the same way.
*  But I do think that Republicans have probably left votes on the table by having Donald Trump
*  as their frontrunner, even though someone like Donald Trump is the only person who could
*  have turned the Republican Party into what it has become.
*  In 2016, I don't think you could.
*  I thought it was very easy to argue that it was as much about Hillary Clinton as it was
*  about Donald Trump and her weaknesses outweighing his.
*  I think that in this election, it is as much about his strengths outweighing the Democratic
*  Party's strengths in a way that wasn't true previously.
*  I just want to break in to say that Fox News has called the overall election for Donald
*  Trump.
*  So far, it's just Fox News.
*  I don't know, Nate, what that means for your ability to even stay at this table.
*  I'm probably just going to get up and leave.
*  Isn't that great content?
*  I know that your time you made you.
*  You should check your phone and make sure that someone's not screaming at you to get
*  out of here.
*  But did you want to respond to what Nate was saying?
*  I was going to say.
*  We do think this is pretty done.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And just to explain the math of this all, because we didn't do that in the first segment,
*  Trump has won the southern swing states, which meant Kamala Harris had to win the northern
*  blue wall states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.
*  And it's now clear she's not going to be winning all three of those states.
*  It seems highly unlikely.
*  So we haven't called it yet.
*  So maybe that's what I'm about to do.
*  I don't know.
*  But some real live live kind of live calling.
*  Yes.
*  So, Nate, thank you for being here.
*  You have to go.
*  Thank you.
*  We are going to keep you in our thoughts.
*  I was going to say if I literally need is leaving, he's walking out the literally go
*  to the space.
*  Yes, I hope I'm going to try to regain my train of thought.
*  I think what you were wrestling with that with that question that you asked me that
*  he very well answered was whether America what they were voting for.
*  Are they voting for economic policies?
*  Were they voting for sort of strongman government?
*  And it's probably some mix of all of the above, because we know a couple conflicting pieces
*  of information.
*  We know that some Trump supporters sort of shrugged their shoulders at some of the more
*  like controversial policies he's put out there, like deporting millions of undocumented
*  immigrants.
*  But we also know that there's polling that shows the country is increasingly open to
*  strongman leadership like that has shifted.
*  Right.
*  And the thing you haven't mentioned and I said, I'm curious how you think about it when
*  it comes to what Americans may or may not have processed is what a second Trump term
*  is likely to mean for Democratic norms.
*  And Lisa, you started to mention those at the very top of our conversation.
*  But let's just review a couple of the things that Donald Trump has said in this campaign
*  and that those around him have said about what he will do expanding presidential power
*  by bringing independent agencies like the Fed directly under the thumb of the president,
*  using the Department of Justice to prosecute his enemies and ensuring that no one within
*  the executive branch will stand in his way, that there will be no one there to object
*  voters in giving Trump a second term.
*  You can argue have endorsed a fundamentally different vision of the presidency and democracy
*  itself.
*  Yeah, you can argue that.
*  I mean, I think there's a I'm like wrestling here because I think there's also a simple
*  story here, too, like inflation is high.
*  The administration is unpopular.
*  And throughout the world, the developed world, we've been seeing incoming governments lose
*  because of basically those two reasons.
*  There's a complicated story about like Trump and his policies and what he's promised.
*  But there's also a simple one that says folks that don't like the country as it is now,
*  and we're willing to roll a dice on what it could be under him.
*  Now, I think to your point is an important one, though, because at this table last week,
*  we talked about democracy and how Democrats don't offer an alternative vision about improving
*  it.
*  And I think that's a really important thing to really talk about here is that when we
*  lay out the ways that Donald Trump has undoubtedly promised a reshaped federal government that
*  is in line with his praise of authoritarians across the world, I think we should also say
*  that like the response to that has just been to say that is wrong and not to say that there
*  are fundamental concerns people have about the way government is working and what Democrats
*  could do to it.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, the point you've made several times is if the strong man, if the man promising
*  something that looks like authoritarianism is the agent of change, voters are more interested
*  in the change that he represents than they are in the theoretical perils to democracy
*  and the Democrats have merely focused on the threat to democracy while missing the element
*  of change.
*  I think we should act as if there is this mutual democracy agreement that we've all
*  come to and that that is a bedrock belief of all Americans when I don't think that's
*  true.
*  I think there is somewhat of a shared agreement about that.
*  But I think throughout our history, we've seen that take turn.
*  And I just feel as if the whether it is democracy, whether it's lecturing Americans that saying
*  inflation is actually not that bad, that there has been a tone coming from Democrats
*  to tell people the problems that they had are not legitimate.
*  And I think that is at the core of their problems in this race.
*  It's hard for me not to go back to the fact that when these issues were most clear and
*  they had a chance to speak to those concerns, they decided not to.
*  And they decided to double down on this administration, to double down on the incumbent.
*  And I feel like you cannot tell the country that Donald Trump is an existential threat
*  and run an 81 year old for former US.
*  I have to ask you this, is that and Lisa, because I think listeners are going to want
*  to know it.
*  And we might as well ask it now, even in these early hours.
*  If Joe Biden had gotten out of the way a lot earlier, do you think it makes a difference?
*  Yes.
*  It's so interesting.
*  I keep thinking about Clinton.
*  And one of the reasons that I think Clinton lost was that there was no real primary process
*  in that race, as you remember.
*  She sort of it was kind of an anointment.
*  Yeah, she blocked everybody out.
*  She had the donors.
*  Sanders ran.
*  He overperformed, showing that there was an interest that she it's not about who's the
*  you know, winning the presidency is about who meets the moment and the primary tests
*  who meets the moment.
*  So basically, there was no primary then there was one with Sanders.
*  She overperformed, but she was pretty much an anointment and she lost.
*  And then you come into this race where, as you point out, Biden hung on Harris.
*  Basically the party made this rapid switch, anointed her effectively.
*  No primary, no competition.
*  No primary.
*  Of course, no one emerged to challenge her.
*  But at that point, it wasn't really possible, right, at that point in the process.
*  So you know, I think that in both those cases, the party failed to take the temperature of
*  the country through a primary process.
*  So they were left with a candidate that may have not been the best fit for the moment.
*  And can I just say, and we're not twice.
*  It was obviously not the best fit for the moment since they lost.
*  And I think the only time they really reset was after the candidate switch, where it fell
*  on Hamala Harris as an individual flip-flopper rather than the party actually changing its
*  median position.
*  Where that would have happened was if they would have had a Democratic primary, right?
*  The whole party would have recalibrated.
*  Okay, final question, because you both need to go.
*  We now have a call on one thing tonight, which is the United States Senate.
*  It will be in the hands of Republicans.
*  It will flip control.
*  We don't have a call on the House, but our colleagues inform us that there's a reasonably
*  good chance that that will fall into the hands of Republicans.
*  We don't know.
*  It takes a while in the West to count a lot of those races.
*  There is now a strong possibility of unified Republican control of the entire government
*  under a Trump-led White House.
*  So this is what I was going to say a little bit at one point earlier when you were asking
*  about what people voted for or didn't vote for.
*  Did they vote for this idea of undoing Democratic norms and all this kind of stuff?
*  In some ways, of course it matters.
*  It always matters what people believe they were voting for, but it also kind of may,
*  at this point, may not matter that much.
*  Donald Trump is coming into his second presidency believing that he has a mandate.
*  There are fewer Republicans who oppose him than when he came in in 16.
*  So whether or not voters endorsed all these plans or didn't endorse these plans...
*  They're likely to get them.
*  They are going to get them.
*  And he believes and his team believes that he has a mandate to push them through with
*  this election.
*  Last word instead.
*  I mean, this could represent pretty extraordinary scale change in the next four years.
*  Absolutely.
*  I mean, the fear of Project 2025 as what a unified Republican government could do did
*  not scare enough people.
*  To make a difference in the race.
*  Yes, and didn't make a big difference in the race.
*  So not only does Donald Trump enter the White House or with a mandate from public that
*  he would have already taken either way.
*  I think that Republicans now know that Donald Trump has outperformed their candidates and
*  has reached people they cannot reach otherwise.
*  And so I think we have seen so much deference to Donald Trump from Republicans already,
*  but that probably will be even more so for the future.
*  And so if you are asking yourself, does Donald Trump return to the White House under the
*  conditions to reshape the country in his image and do so virtually unchecked?
*  That also is a possibility.
*  And so that's why I talk about failure imagination among public is because I don't know we know
*  where that goes.
*  And so all I'm saying is I think that we can see this election as an endorsement of Trump's
*  return.
*  But I don't think we should see it as a full endorsement of all of what he has promised.
