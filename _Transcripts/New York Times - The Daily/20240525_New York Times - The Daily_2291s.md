# 'The Interview': Ted Sarandosâ€™s Plan to Get You to Binge Even More
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70_gJCpKG-o)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview.
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro.
*  If you're like me, you probably spent some large portion of this week sitting on your
*  sofa watching Netflix.
*  Rom-coms are my thing and my latest obsession is this Turkish series.
*  It's called Thank You Next.
*  Since I watch a few international rom-coms, you can bet that Netflix is going to feed
*  me more of them.
*  Maybe you've had this experience with sports documentaries or thrillers.
*  But as I'm vegging out on the couch, I'm not really thinking much about the people
*  shaping my habit.
*  That's why I wanted to talk to Ted Sarandos.
*  Sarandos has been at Netflix for 24 years, nearly as long as founder Reed Hastings.
*  He's now the co-CEO of the company, along with Greg Peters, and is in charge of their
*  creative output.
*  He oversaw Netflix's early expansion into streaming and pioneered the binge watch.
*  Under him, the company developed one of the most powerful algorithms out there, the one
*  keeping me glued to my sofa.
*  He was also the guy who greenlit Netflix's first original productions, like House of
*  Cards, making Netflix into a studio, not just a platform.
*  And he's led the company as it's ventured into reality TV, prestige film, and live entertainment,
*  including a just announced deal to broadcast some of the NFL's Christmas Day games.
*  There have been less rosy moments at the company in recent years, including a few rounds of
*  layoffs.
*  But through it all, Sarandos keeps giving audiences more of what we want.
*  Whether that's good for us or not is another question.
*  And that's a big part of what we talked about.
*  Here's my conversation with Ted Sarandos.
*  As I've been reading about you, you have an unusual background for a Hollywood or tech
*  CEO.
*  I would agree with that assessment.
*  Yeah, I think as Reed may have said it early in my career here, which is I did not breathe
*  the rarefied air.
*  Can you tell me a little bit about how you came up?
*  Yeah, so I'll go real quickly in the far back, which is that my grandfather came from Samos,
*  Greece.
*  He used to read cowboy novels.
*  And he came to America thinking that he could be a trail cook.
*  He found out quickly that there was no trail cook jobs in New Jersey.
*  He took one vacation in his lifetime, which was to Arizona to see a rodeo.
*  And from that day forward, he wore a bolo tie every day.
*  He talked about that vacation until he died.
*  And in tribute to him, all eight of the kids moved to Arizona after he passed away, including
*  my father.
*  My parents had four kids in their 20s.
*  So these were kids raising kids really.
*  And our house was always chaos.
*  And my only escape from that chaos was that little box.
*  And I watched a lot of television.
*  And my mom in her own kind of reckless way, when we couldn't afford it, would always buy
*  gadgets.
*  We were the first people I know to have a VCR.
*  And it was a very unaffordable luxury at that time.
*  And most of my upbringing, we never had all the utilities on at the same time.
*  So the gas would be cut off and the foam would be cut off and the electric would come up,
*  but never all simultaneously.
*  But for some reason, we had a VCR.
*  And total happenstance.
*  The second video store in the state of Arizona opened up two blocks from my house.
*  Do you remember the first thing you ever checked out in the video store?
*  Yeah, it was a filmed version of the Willie Nelson Fourth of July picnic.
*  For real?
*  That was the thing that you...
*  That was the very first thing I rented.
*  And you actually end up working at a video store.
*  I did at that very video store, Arizona Video Cassettes West.
*  By the way, that's a very descriptive name, Arizona Video Cassettes West.
*  I told you exactly what we do.
*  I dropped out of college at a community college and I worked at the video store full time.
*  The way that I've heard you tell it, there was like 900 titles in the catalog and you
*  would have seen all of them.
*  And people would come in and ask you for recommendations.
*  Is that how that would work?
*  That's how it worked generally.
*  I think people would walk in and roam around the stores aimlessly.
*  But actually, I kind of enjoyed that experience.
*  It was pretty novel at the beginning.
*  But then you really were trying to find something in that sea of boxes.
*  And eventually I realized I had this interesting capacity for remembering these movies one
*  after another and ability to kind of put, oh, that was kind of like that one and that
*  one's kind of like that one.
*  And when people would come in, I would remember, oh, hey, remember you like that movie?
*  You're going to love this one.
*  I got good enough at it that even when the stores were very busy and there was a long
*  line, they would wait for me because they wanted me to suggest something to them.
*  And it told me something very important, which is people really value that choice.
*  So cut to now.
*  And when people talk about how we're entertained, it's all about the streaming wars, right?
*  So we have Peacock and we have Hulu and we have Apple Plus and we have Macs and they
*  all spent a fortune to try and catch up with Netflix.
*  And the consensus seems to be that you, Netflix, won the war.
*  I try not to take those stories too seriously, any more than we did a couple of years ago
*  when they said we were dead.
*  So I think we have to really remember this is a long, long journey, lots of battles along
*  the way.
*  And this is probably a battle, more than it is winning a war.
*  Early on, I think we were discounted because I think the studios thought these tech guys
*  are never going to figure out programming.
*  They're never going to figure out the creative part of the business.
*  And I think we largely have proved them wrong.
*  And I think it would be crazy for us to think, well, these entertainment companies are never
*  going to figure out the tech.
*  I do just want to get your sense of what is happening in Hollywood right now because the
*  box office is down, studios are laying off people.
*  You talk to people there and people feel gloomy.
*  They feel afraid.
*  One of the most storied studios is on the block, Paramount.
*  What is your feeling about what's going on if it isn't Netflix's victory?
*  Because you have so fundamentally shifted what happens in Hollywood that that has had
*  some knock-on effects.
*  Yeah.
*  I think if in periods of radical change in any industry, the legacy players generally
*  have a challenge, which is they're trying to protect their legacy businesses.
*  We entered into a business in transition when we started mailing DVDs 25 years ago.
*  We knew that physical media was not going to be the future.
*  When I met Reed Hastings in 1999, he described the world we live in right now, which is almost
*  all entertainment is going to come into the home on the internet.
*  And he told me that at a time when literally no entertainment was coming into the home
*  on the internet.
*  And so it's a very big vision to have.
*  And it really helped us navigate this transition from physical to digital because we didn't
*  spend any time trying to protect our DVD business.
*  As it started to wane, we started to invest in more and more and more in streaming.
*  And we did that because we knew that that's where the puck was going.
*  At one point, our DVD business was driving all the profit of the business and a lot of
*  the revenue of the business.
*  And we made a conscious decision to stop inviting the DVD employees to the company meeting.
*  We were that kind of rigid about where this thing was heading.
*  That's harsh.
*  It does sound harsh that we did that, but it got the whole company in the mindset is
*  that we shouldn't keep investing in the old business.
*  It's going to prevent us from investing in the new business.
*  And the new business is going to get us to the next place.
*  Which leads us to where Netflix is today, where you bring a lot of global content in.
*  You have all sorts of different types of things.
*  In the job you have now, you are probably best positioned to shape what kind of culture
*  people are consuming.
*  What have you noticed about shifting tastes in America?
*  I think we're entering into a new era now where content and great stories can come from
*  almost anywhere in the world.
*  And they can very conveniently sit on the shelf.
*  I'm doing air quotes right now.
*  You can go to Netflix to your favorite show and you will discover an incredible story
*  from Korea, or an incredible story from Italy, or an incredible story from Spain that you
*  would otherwise have no access to and maybe no awareness of before.
*  But that it's this kind of storytelling that's very close to the kind of storytelling that
*  you like.
*  So the creator of Squid Game, he pitched that show as a movie for 10 years.
*  He'd almost completely given up on it.
*  And our team in Korea had the foresight to advise him that this is a great story, but
*  it's a much bigger world.
*  Have you ever thought about going out and trying to break down that world a little more
*  and giving us a little more exposition?
*  And he went off and wrote those scripts and made Squid Game.
*  And Squid Game became the most watched show in the history of Netflix around the world,
*  including in the United States.
*  Did that surprise you at the time?
*  It blew my mind.
*  I knew it was great.
*  I knew it would do great in Korea, but I had no idea it would be the most watched show
*  on television, maybe in the history of television.
*  But when Scott Frank wrote Queen's Gambit, that was a script that he could not sell as
*  a film for the longest time.
*  And it was an enormous success on Netflix around the world.
*  And it was just one decision away from still sitting on a shelf, gathering dust.
*  So you're giving these wonderful examples of the kinds of shows that Netflix has been
*  able to bring to people.
*  These are prestige shows.
*  I am thinking of this, though, in terms of this broader question of how we consume culture
*  today.
*  I'm thinking about my own experience on Netflix.
*  So my husband likes horror, and his Netflix account looks very different to mine.
*  In fact, we keep it very, very separate.
*  His is Lulu Don't Touch, and mine is Lulu Romcom.
*  These are your profile names?
*  These are our profile names.
*  He doesn't want me to muddy his horror algorithm.
*  And when you look at them both, he doesn't get rom-coms and I don't get horror.
*  And it feels like the cultural curation is more a science than an art.
*  That thing that used to be the connection where someone might tell you about something,
*  now it's managed in a way that can allow for these serendipitous things like the surprise
*  of Squid Game, but often gives you more of what you already want.
*  I guess I'm just asking, has streaming been good for culture?
*  Oh, I think it's been great for culture.
*  Not only great for culture in a strange way, I think it's been great to make the world
*  a safer place.
*  Oh, tell me why.
*  I think you're exposed to cultures around the world in a way that makes you more understanding
*  and empathetic.
*  I don't know if you've seen the movie, like A Separation.
*  It's a story of a couple getting divorced in Iran.
*  And it's like, you realize when you watch it is how much we have in common with each
*  other around the world.
*  And I think it's just like all storytelling makes the world a smaller, safer place.
*  But doesn't it atomize you too?
*  This idea of I'm having my own unique experience, myself, my choices, that I get fed more of
*  the same.
*  And this idea of communal culture and communal spaces gets sort of pushed away.
*  No, I think it's happening around when you see something like Baby Reindeer.
*  There was a time when something like Baby Reindeer would not even be seen in the United
*  States.
*  And if it did, it'd be seen on PBS once.
*  We should say, as we're speaking, Baby Reindeer is the number one show on Netflix.
*  It's about a stalker.
*  It has some dark themes of sexual assault.
*  And it's been a hit.
*  And Britney created and stars the person who's telling their own story about what happened
*  to them.
*  It's very, very big in the UK.
*  And in that way that Netflix does this, it gets picked up in the algorithm and starts
*  getting more and more presented.
*  Because when something gets that big in one country, it's likely there's a lot of audience
*  for it outside of that country.
*  And it's been an enormous hit around the world.
*  And the way that you just described it, I may never watch.
*  But I think when you sit down and say, this is somebody who is being stalked by a woman
*  who, and the situation is becoming more and more dangerous, and yet he's oddly likes
*  it enough that he doesn't want to stop it.
*  And he has to try to figure out what is it about him that makes him not want to stop
*  this incredibly dangerous situation.
*  And it impacts over these incredible episodes of this story that people devour.
*  And I don't think it's because it's dark and I don't think it's because it's weird.
*  I think it's because it's a really incredible human story.
*  Just to come back to something you said here, are international audiences pushing American
*  audiences to broaden their horizons?
*  That's an interesting feedback loop.
*  Yeah, I think it's, I mean, what it's pushing is, is that you don't have to adapt your storytelling
*  to America to work.
*  If your movie, if your film works, if your TV series works in the home country, it's
*  got to be very authentic.
*  And I think what international audiences pick up on is that authenticity.
*  So I do think when you try to engineer something to travel, it really appeals to no one.
*  I can't think of anything that we've done that has been engineered to travel that actually
*  did travel.
*  I'm thinking in particular of, you know, Hollywood studios trying to make global hits, right,
*  that will play in China, that will play in the United States, that will be popular in
*  Argentina.
*  That's hard.
*  And I do think that globalization of American film has disconnected American film from audiences.
*  I think that the love affair with film is lessened because of it.
*  So we're talking about prestige shows, global hits, but there's also been a lot of discussion
*  about what's been dubbed folding your laundry shows, right?
*  That isn't difficult to watch.
*  It's light.
*  It's fun.
*  It's not expensive to make.
*  And, you know, you've got a lot of examples of that.
*  Selling Sunset, Jinnon Georgia, Alone, the survivalist show.
*  Do you feel like you've cornered the market on that?
*  And is that like a title that you want to own?
*  If there's one quote that I could take back, it would have been in 2012, I said, we're
*  going to become HBO before HBO could become us.
*  What I was trying to say is, you know, at that time, HBO was, I think, the gold standard
*  of original programming.
*  What I should have said back then is we want to be HBO and CBS and BBC and all those different
*  networks around the world that entertain people and not narrow it to just HBO.
*  Because I do think that prestige lead programming plays a very important role in culture, but
*  it's very small.
*  It's a boutique business.
*  And we're currently programming for about 650 million people around the world.
*  We have to have a very broad variety of things that people watch and love.
*  So I think we are, again, very consumer centric.
*  So we take a consumer view of quality.
*  The people who love Jinnon Georgia will tell you, Jinnon Georgia is great.
*  So to me, that's quality television.
*  And if that's what you want to watch, we want to make the best version of that.
*  I want to ask you about the movie side of things, because we've been talking about
*  the series.
*  You have a new head of film, Dan Lin, and that suggests to me that you're tweaking
*  strategy.
*  Whenever somebody new comes in, they have an idea of what they want to do differently
*  and they have a different charge.
*  And a criticism of Netflix from some corners is that you make too much stuff that isn't
*  as good as it could be, specifically in movies.
*  So I guess the question is, are you trying to make better movies now?
*  Is that the mandate?
*  So I will back up and say that I don't agree with the premise that quantity and quality
*  are somehow in conflict with each other.
*  We've had eight Best Picture nominees in the last five years on Netflix.
*  So I do think we've been making, like we were talking about earlier, about the breadth of
*  things.
*  I think our programming and our movie programming has been great, but it's just not all for
*  you.
*  It's not meant to be all for you.
*  I know, but you also have an Irish wish, for example.
*  And I was looking at your summer slate, the movies are all pretty mid-tier.
*  Well, look, I think, like I said, I think the way that we all talk about films culturally,
*  they tend to wrap around either things that were number one at the box office or won the
*  Oscar for Best Picture and almost nothing in between.
*  And I do think that people's tastes are incredibly broad and diverse.
*  Irish wish is great.
*  If you love a rom-com, you'd like it?
*  I'm giving you a face.
*  I saw the face.
*  My point is, is that I am going by the numbers that people, how many people watch it, how
*  many people watch the whole thing.
*  People generally turn off things they don't like in this on-demand world.
*  Us rom-com lovers are very committed to watch things to the bitter end.
*  But again, I think that Irish wish is at the kind of high end of the hallmark scale.
*  Not at the kind of mid-tier of the Fox searchlight scale.
*  I don't want to get tied up on Irish wish, but I do want to understand a little bit of
*  what is going to change now, if anything, because you have made films like The Gray
*  Man.
*  It had a budget of 200 million.
*  Red Notice was the same.
*  They weren't critical successes.
*  So I guess, how are you thinking about how to make movies at Netflix?
*  Look, I would just say that we've never at any point wanted to make bad movies at Netflix.
*  We do acknowledge that it's a creative endeavor and some things don't go as planned.
*  I would tell you though that I'm very pleased with the mix of how things have come out.
*  I'm very pleased that we generally have films in the hunt for the Oscar and we have films
*  that people just really like and are just entertaining.
*  And to your point, Red Notice is one of the most successful films we've ever had on Netflix
*  in terms of the audience.
*  I guess what I'm asking is, are you going to spend that kind of money going forward?
*  I think some of that early big budgets things were mostly around the fact that we had to
*  pay a little bit of a pioneer tax as we entered into that film space where we're competing
*  with movies at the box office.
*  So we probably in those early days of the big budgets, things were bigger budgets than
*  they needed to be.
*  Those big giant scale movies, when they deliver, there's nothing better.
*  And when they miss, man, it's a sting.
*  But I would tell you that what I push our creative teams across the board to do is push
*  on the ambition, push for the audience, not just to make things bigger, but to make them
*  better always.
*  I just want to take a step back here from talk about strategy because it wasn't always
*  certain that Netflix was going to be where it is now.
*  In 2022, your stock plunged 70% after you lost subscribers for the first time since
*  2011.
*  Can you take me to that moment as a leader?
*  What do you do when something like that happens?
*  You'd had this exponential growth and then all of a sudden it was a difficult moment.
*  What is the calibration for you?
*  On any given day, we can lose or gain 200,000 subscribers, which is what that was, which
*  was the first time we went negative.
*  We went negative by 200,000 subscribers.
*  And if the quarter had ended a few weeks later, that wouldn't have been the case.
*  This is probably the benefit of being around for a long time.
*  We had times that were much tougher than that in terms of where we were heading with the
*  business in the earliest days before we were a public company even.
*  And in fact, when you look back at everything, I think you look back at any chart that's
*  straight up and to the right and you think nothing ever went wrong.
*  That's what it looks like when you look back.
*  But in the moment, those little tiny dips in hills and valleys were emotionally very
*  rocking to a company and to a culture.
*  Well what you did is you threw out some of the company's longstanding core principles,
*  chief among them not having advertisers.
*  You introduced an ad-supported subscription tier.
*  And so I'm just wondering as someone who had been with Netflix for as long as you had,
*  did it feel like that was a real turn betraying the identity of the company?
*  I mean, you had to make a tough choice.
*  It really wasn't that we were core principles against advertising.
*  It's just advertising was our counter position to television.
*  The way that no late fees was our counter position to video stores in our DVD days.
*  What do people don't like about TV?
*  Watching the ads and waiting a week for the next episode.
*  We realized though in this world of unlimited choice, what we didn't do is give a choice
*  to people who didn't mind advertising at all and wanted a lower price.
*  So for us, we thought that it was actually market expanding to give more choice to folks
*  if they wanted a lower price and they didn't mind ads.
*  So you got to evolve.
*  You got to evolve.
*  I want to ask you a little bit more about you as a leader.
*  Hollywood celebrities and leaders have always been politically active.
*  And you also have been no exception.
*  In 2020, you supported Black Lives Matter.
*  During the invasion of Ukraine, you pulled Netflix out of Russia.
*  It seems though that corporate activism is on its way out.
*  So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that.
*  Yeah, look, I don't think it's because of...
*  When you think about diversity, diversity should be all things, including diversity
*  of thought, which makes political activism of companies very difficult because people
*  have different opinions and different ideas and different thoughts.
*  And you're representing a lot of different constituencies.
*  So I think companies should be very, very careful about how they insert themselves into
*  these discussions.
*  Sometimes when it's just a matter of pretty pure black and white right and wrong, I think
*  of anything we've ever done.
*  It's impossible to do business in Russia without being in business with that government.
*  So for me, that was kind of a no brainer decision.
*  I didn't view it as political.
*  I viewed it as quite impractical to do anything but.
*  I mean, you've seen other companies in Hollywood, Disney, among others, but we're seeing Google
*  now sort of crack down on internal activism within their company.
*  You say it's a difficult balancing act.
*  And so as a company that tries to be all things to all people, how do you navigate that?
*  Yeah, I think people have very different sensibilities about things depending on where they are in
*  the world and different opinions of these things.
*  And I do think that it's one of those things where it's very hard to say that our view
*  would represent the views of all of our members and all of our employees.
*  I think that would be a very high bar to clear.
*  But that is the clear.
*  What is the bar I would like it to clear if we do that as a company?
*  And I do think, by the way, just people look for, I don't know why that happened over the
*  last couple of years, where people looked to corporate leaders to do those things.
*  They didn't used to.
*  I want to look ahead to the future because obviously what Netflix decides to do will
*  impact the way that we all consume culture.
*  Do you see Netflix now sort of middle aged?
*  I mean, you're no longer the upstart business that needs to constantly be proving itself
*  and now you're a more mature business.
*  Middle age might be the wrong word, I guess.
*  Middle age might be too old.
*  Sorry about that.
*  Speaking for myself here.
*  Speaking as someone like myself who is, I mean, yeah, if I think I'm going to live to
*  120, I'm middle aged.
*  But I think the business is maturing, of course, and I think it's taking on different characteristics.
*  And again, those things that you didn't do before, we weren't adamantly against advertising.
*  But when you start thinking about it as actually growing the addressable market for Netflix,
*  that's a great thing to do advertising.
*  Just do it well and make sure that it works well both for the members and for advertisers.
*  So who is your competitor now?
*  Look, I think we compete for screen time.
*  That's the easiest way to do it.
*  Almost all watching on Netflix is on a big screen on the television.
*  And we're in the US, we're about 10% of screen time on connected televisions.
*  Outside of the US, we're as little as 3%.
*  A ton of room to grow.
*  What we compete with is everything else that happens on that screen.
*  Social media, including YouTube, other streaming apps, and gaming, which takes up a lot of screen time.
*  Yeah, I mean, YouTube is actually bigger than you.
*  It's mostly free.
*  Free is super popular.
*  Free is super popular and you're not free.
*  How do you compete with free?
*  Yeah, look, I think you've got to be worth paying for all the time.
*  And we have to be better at them all the time.
*  At the programming, at the choosing of it, at driving the conversation around the world of it,
*  which drives the kind of must-see-ness of the things that we're doing.
*  So it's still a lot of work to do there.
*  Yeah, I mean, one thing that YouTube's had for a while that you're just starting to break into is live TV.
*  Yeah.
*  Earlier this year, WWE announced it was bringing Raw, the weekly live pro wrestling show to Netflix.
*  You've just had live roasts, comedy specials.
*  Talk me through the move into live entertainment.
*  What is that doing for you?
*  It's really incredible, the conversation that gets driven around the world around a big live event.
*  You know, in a world of on-demand and total control, the novelty of a big live event,
*  if it's the Super Bowl or the Tom Brady roast, is people get very excited that they're all watching it at the same time.
*  And what we saw with the Tom Brady roast was it was driving so much conversation around the world
*  that the audience kept growing and growing and growing minute on minute that people kept coming to it.
*  And I just look at that and say, well, there's some real value in people gathering around the TV at the same time of doing that.
*  It's a novel. It's not the way people watch most things,
*  but it's something we don't want to not be a part of because it's happening on that television screen and that people get very excited about it.
*  It's making me laugh a little because you're like reinventing the live special.
*  Yeah, live has been around for a long time, it turns out. We started that way, as you recall.
*  But I do think it's funny, the novelty of it, because I do remember, you know, as a kid,
*  when Roots was on every night for the streets were empty and people were in there.
*  Remember the early days of TV, I Love Lucy, when they would go to a commercial break,
*  the water pressure would go down because everyone went to the bathroom at the same time.
*  So we don't want to not be part of all of those things that you could we'd look to that happen on that screen.
*  I just want to look ahead in our last few minutes.
*  I am just wondering, what are you most worried about?
*  Mostly, I think a lot about our own internal execution.
*  So I worry a lot about, you know, you get big, you move fast and you miss some big turn
*  because there was some internal miss where you took your eye off the ball.
*  So I really try to think about that all the time is how do we, you know, how do you it's a very different company
*  with 270 million subscribers around the world than it was when, you know, when I joined with 175,000 subscribers getting DVDs in the US.
*  So how you evolve the company, how you don't get too nostalgic, how you don't be too romantic about the past
*  because the future is so exciting.
*  And I do think that movies and games and television and standup comedy, all these things are real art forms.
*  Otherwise, it's just killing an hour.
*  And then I'd be very worried about TikTok.
*  This is not just killing an hour.
*  This is entertaining, enlightening, expanding, seeding conversation, all those things.
*  Ted Sarandos, we are going to speak again.
*  Yes, yes.
*  But I really, really thank you for your time.
*  This has been really interesting.
*  Thank you, Luluf.
*  After the break, I called Ted back to talk about a part of the future that people in Hollywood have more mixed feelings about, AI.
*  There's not a scenario, I don't believe, that an AI program is going to write a better screenplay than a great writer.
*  Or going to replace a great performance, or we won't be able to tell the difference.
*  AI is not going to take your job.
*  The person who uses AI well might take your job.
*  Hello.
*  Hello.
*  This is the interview.
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro.
*  So as you know, the premise for this is we call you back a few days later to sort of talk over maybe things that I've been thinking about, maybe things that you've been thinking about.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm wondering if you had any thoughts from our previous conversation.
*  The thing that stuck with me most was our discussion about film.
*  Because there's so many ways it captures everything we're trying to do.
*  And I feel like our discussion about Irish Wish is a great example of how hard it is.
*  Because we all have these great contradictions even inside of ourselves.
*  So I love the crown and I love is it cake?
*  And I love them both equally, which doesn't make any sense to both.
*  So when I think about that and think about all of our people, what are we trying to do?
*  We're trying to make movies that are great.
*  We define quality from the perspective of the audience.
*  So if the audience loves the movie, it's great.
*  That's quality.
*  And for me, it is Irish Wish maybe didn't scratch the itch for you, but 65 million people watch that movie.
*  That's an enormous hit and people love it.
*  Critics and reviews, it's a great thing.
*  You want to please everybody.
*  But sometimes the movies that we make are not made for critics.
*  So it's kind of a no brainer.
*  Some movies might get a bad review because it's not really made for that demographic of a film critic.
*  But for the audience, they love it.
*  Well, this dovetails very nicely in what I was thinking about after our conversation.
*  Because when we spoke, I was sort of pressing you on this question of whether your strategy, which is everything for everyone,
*  affects the quality of your programming.
*  And you argued, as you just argued, that you can have quality and quantity and you make a good case.
*  So it left me wondering this.
*  Discernment is part of any entertainment business.
*  So what's not right for Netflix?
*  Great question.
*  Great question.
*  I mean, I don't think that there's a clean answer because the best version of something may work really well for Netflix.
*  That, you know, but just hasn't worked to date.
*  There's some obvious ones like we today we don't do like breaking news and that kind of thing because I think there's a lot of other outlets for it.
*  People aren't looking to us for that.
*  And to the extent that On Demand and the distribution channel and the recommendation channel brings a lot of value to the storytelling.
*  That's perfectly in our sweet spot.
*  I guess I'm thinking of a Barbie, an Oppenheimer.
*  I mean, are there things that just don't feel like they're in your wheelhouse right now?
*  I think both of those movies would be great for Netflix.
*  They definitely would have enjoyed just as big an audience on Netflix.
*  And so I don't think there's any reason to believe that certain kind of movies do or don't work.
*  There's no reason to believe that the size of the screen or that the movie itself for all people is better in any size of screen.
*  My son's editor is 28 years old and he watched Lords of Arabia on his phone.
*  Oh no. Oh, that's sacrilege.
*  I'm going to shift a little bit because there was something else that I was thinking about.
*  I'd love to know from your vantage point how you think about the possible creative tradeoffs and consequences of using AI.
*  I think that AI is a natural kind of advancement of things that are happening in the creative space today anyway.
*  Think about volume stages did not displace on location shooting.
*  I actually think about things like AI as being, I don't think of them as a creative tool in the threatening sense.
*  I think of them as a creator's tool in an enabling sense.
*  Ways that filmmakers, writers, directors, editors will use AI as a tool to do their jobs better and to do things more efficiently and more effectively.
*  And even in the best case, to put things on screen that would be impossible to do.
*  So I think this is a creator's tool. Nobody's designed to replace creators with AI.
*  It's meant to be a creator's tool to enhance the ability to tell stories better than ever.
*  Which I think that's the possibility of it.
*  And if we get caught up in all the possible downsides of it and we just get stuck, I don't think that's going to help anything.
*  It's very difficult to stop the advancement of new technology.
*  And in almost every case, new technology in entertainment has been fought tooth and nail.
*  And at the end of the day, improves the business.
*  Think about this gigantic leap from hand-drawn animation to computer-generated animation.
*  And look how many more people animation employs today than it used to.
*  That business has gotten bigger and better because of these advancements in technology.
*  Remember how everybody fought home video?
*  And for several couple of decades, the studios wouldn't license movies to television.
*  So every advancement in technology and entertainment has been fought and ultimately has turned out to grow the business.
*  And I don't know that this will be any different.
*  I guess the difference might be that all those things were tools that were used to, you know, open up the creative space.
*  Whereas what a lot of people feel is that AI might actually supplant the creators.
*  I have more faith in humans than that. I really do.
*  I think that if you go back, there's a great documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now.
*  It's a beautiful movie. It's really one of my favorite documentaries.
*  But in that movie, I don't know what year it came out now.
*  And Francis Ford Coppola is predicting that some kid in the Midwest is going to make the next great movie because cameras are going to be so cheap.
*  And it is true that tools have never been more accessible.
*  And telling a great story could be as simple as taking your phone out and shooting it and uploading it to YouTube.
*  It happens all the time.
*  But I do think, like, if you think about that as a thing to be afraid of, what do you think about that as an opportunity for how do I do this?
*  There's not a scenario, I don't believe, that an AI program is going to write a better screenplay than a great writer.
*  Or going to replace a great performance. Or we won't be able to tell the difference.
*  AI is not going to take your job. The person who uses AI well might take your job.
*  Before we go, we've been talking about all the ways the industry is changing and Netflix is growing.
*  I'm wondering, is it possible for Netflix to get too big?
*  You know, it's a very broad space. So like you said, we're, look how long we've been at this and look how I think I'm very proud of what the teams do.
*  And we're 10% of what happens on a connected television today.
*  But when I think about how people, how we divide time between video games, social media, user-generated content, all the other studios, all the other television broadcasts, all the sporting events.
*  So you've got so many things you're competing for that the chance to be dominant is almost, is very difficult.
*  And it's not the goal, the goal is to be the best.
*  That's Ted Sarandos. This conversation was produced by Wyatt Orm.
