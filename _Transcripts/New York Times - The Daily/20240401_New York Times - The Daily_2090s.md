# Ronna McDaniel, TV News and the Trump Problem
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gLlInIehx8)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  Today, the saga of Ronald McDaniel and NBC and what it reveals about the state of television
*  news headed into the 2024 presidential race. Jim Rutenberg, a Times writer at large, is
*  our guest. It's Monday, April 1st.
*  Jim, NBC News just went through a very public, a very searing drama over the past week that
*  we wanted you to make sense of in your unique capacity as a longtime media and political
*  reporter at the Times. This is your sweet spot. You were, I believe, born to dissect
*  this story for us.
*  Oh, brother.
*  Well, on the one hand, this is a very small moment for a major network like NBC. They
*  hire as a contributor, not an anchor, not a correspondent, as a contributor, Ronald
*  McDaniel, the former RNC chairwoman. It blows up in a mini scandal at the network. But to
*  me, it represents a much larger issue that's been there since that moment Donald J. Trump
*  took his shiny gold escalator down to announce his presidential run in 2015. This struggle
*  by the news media to figure out, especially on television, how do we capture him, cover
*  him for all of his lies, all the challenges he poses to democratic norms, yet not alienate
*  some 74, 75 million American voters who still follow him, still believe in him, and still
*  want to hear his reality reflected in the news that they're listening to.
*  Right. Which is about as gnarly a conundrum as anyone has ever dealt with in the news
*  media.
*  Well, it's proven so far unsolvable.
*  Well, let's use the story of what actually happened with Ronald McDaniel and NBC to illustrate
*  your point. And I think that means describing precisely what happened in this situation.
*  The story starts out so simply. It's such a basic thing that television networks do.
*  As elections get underway, they want people who will reflect the two parties. They want
*  talking heads. They want insiders. They want them on their payroll so they can rely on
*  them whenever they need them. And they want them to be high level so they can speak with
*  great knowledge about the two major candidates.
*  Right. And rather than needing to beg these people to come on their show at six o'clock
*  when they might be busy and it's not their full time job, they go off and they basically
*  put them on retainer for a bunch of money.
*  Yeah. And in this case, here's this perfect scenario because quite recently, Ronald McDaniel,
*  the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee through the Trump era, most of it,
*  is now out on the market. She's actually recently been forced out of the party and all the networks
*  are interested because here's the consummate insider from Trump world ready to get snatched
*  up under contract for the next election and can really represent this movement that they've
*  been trying to capture. So MBC's key news executives move pretty aggressively, pretty
*  swiftly and they sign her up for a $300,000 a year contributors contract.
*  Nice money if you can get it.
*  Not a millions of dollars that they pay their anchors, but a very nice contract. I'll take
*  it. In the eyes of MBC execs, she was perfect because she can be on Meet the Press as a
*  panelist. She can help as they figure out some of their coverage. They have 24 hours
*  of data, Phil. And here's an official from the RNC.
*  You can almost imagine the question that would be asked to her. It's 10 p.m. on election
*  night. Ronald, what are the Trump people thinking right now? They're looking at the same numbers
*  you are.
*  That was good. But that's exactly it. And we all know it, right? This is television
*  in our current era. So last Friday, MBC makes what should be a routine announcement, but
*  one they're very proud of that they've hired Ronna McDaniel. And in a statement, they say
*  it couldn't be a more important moment to have a voice like Ronna's on the team. So
*  all is good, right? Except for there's a fly in the ointment because it turns out that
*  Ronna McDaniel has been slated to appear on Meet the Press, not as a paid MBC contributor,
*  but as the former recently ousted RNC chair with the Meet the Press host, Kristen Welker,
*  who's preparing to have a real tough interview with Ronna McDaniel. Because of course, Ronna
*  McDaniel was chair of the party and at Trump's side as he tried to refuse his election laws.
*  So this was supposed to be a showdown interview.
*  From MBC News in Washington, the longest running show in television history. This is Meet the
*  Press with Kristen Welker.
*  And here all of a sudden, Kristen Welker is thrown for a loop.
*  In full disclosure to our viewers, this interview was scheduled weeks before it was announced
*  that McDaniel had become a paid MBC News contributor.
*  Because now she's actually interviewing a member of the family who's on the same payroll.
*  Right, right. Suddenly she's interviewing a colleague.
*  This will be a news interview. And I was not involved in her hiring.
*  So what happens during the interview?
*  So Welker is prepared for a tough interview and that's exactly what she does.
*  Can you say as you sit here today, did Joe Biden win the election fair and square?
*  He won. He's the legitimate president. Fair and square. He won. It's certified. It's done.
*  She presses her on the key question that a lot of Republicans get asked these days. Do
*  you accept Joe Biden was the winner of the election?
*  I do think Kristen, let me just say something.
*  Why has it taken you until now to be able to say that?
*  I'm going to push back a little.
*  McDaniel gets defensive at times.
*  I do think it's fair to say there were problems in 2020. And to say that does not mean he's
*  not the legitimate president.
*  But Ronna, when you say that, it suggests that there was something wrong with the election.
*  And you know that the election was the most heavily scrutinized.
*  It's a really combative interview.
*  I want to turn now to your actions in the aftermath of the 2020 election.
*  And Welker actually really does go deeply into McDaniel's record in those weeks before
*  January 6th.
*  On November 17th, you and Donald Trump were recorded pushing two Republican Michigan election
*  officials not to certify the results of the election.
*  For instance, she presses McDaniel on McDaniel's role in an attempt to convince a couple county
*  commissioner level canvassers in Michigan to not certify Biden's victory.
*  Our call that night was to say, are you okay? Vote your conscience, not pushing them to
*  do anything.
*  McDaniel says, look, I was just telling them to vote their conscience.
*  They should do whatever they think is right.
*  But you said, do not sign it.
*  If you can go home tonight, do not sign it.
*  How can people read that as anything other than a pressure campaign?
*  And Welker's not going to just let her off the hook.
*  Welker presses her on Trump's own comments about January 6th and Trump's efforts recently
*  to gloss over some of the violence and to say that those who have been arrested, he'll
*  free them.
*  Do you support that?
*  I want to be very clear.
*  The violence that happened on January 6th is unacceptable.
*  And this is a frankly fascinating moment because you can hear McDaniel starting to, if not
*  quite reverse some of her positions, though in some cases she does that, at least really
*  soften her language.
*  It's almost as if she's switching uniforms from the RNC one to an NBC one or almost like
*  breaking from a role she was playing.
*  Ronna, why not speak out earlier?
*  Why just speak out about that now?
*  When you're the RNC chair, you kind of take one for the whole team, right?
*  Now I get to be a little bit more myself, right?
*  She says, hey, you know what?
*  Sometimes as RNC chair, you just have to take it for the team sometimes.
*  Right.
*  What she's really saying is I did things as chairwoman of the Republican National Committee
*  that now that I no longer have that job, I can candidly say I wished I hadn't done, which
*  is very honest, but it's also another way of saying I'm two faced or, you know, I was
*  playing a part.
*  Ronna McDaniel, thank you very much for having me here this morning.
*  Then something extraordinary happens, and I have to say, I've never seen a moment like
*  this in decades of watching television news and covering television news.
*  Welcome back. The panel is here.
*  Chuck Todd, NBC News chief political analyst.
*  Welker brings her regular panel on, including Chuck Todd, now the senior NBC political analyst.
*  Chuck, let's dive right in.
*  What were your takeaways?
*  And he launches right into what he calls...
*  Look, let me deal with the elephant in the room.
*  The elephant being this hiring of McDaniel.
*  I think our bosses owe you an apology for putting you in this situation.
*  And he proceeds on NBC's air to lace into management for, as he describes it, putting
*  Welker in this crazy, awkward position.
*  Because I don't know what to believe.
*  She is now a paid contributor by NBC News.
*  I have no idea whether any answer she gave to you was because she didn't want to mess
*  up her contract.
*  And Todd is very hung up on this idea that when she was speaking for the party, she would
*  say one thing.
*  And now that she's on the payroll at NBC, she's saying another thing.
*  She has credibility issues that she still has to deal with.
*  Is she speaking for herself or is she speaking on behalf of who's paying her?
*  Todd is basically saying, how are we supposed to know which one to believe?
*  Right.
*  What can we believe?
*  It is important for this network and for always to have a wide aperture, having
*  ideological diversity on this panel is something I prided myself on.
*  We take you and I...
*  And what he's effectively saying is that his bosses should have never hired her in
*  this capacity.
*  I understand the motivation, but this execution, I think, was poor.
*  Someone said to me last night, we live in complicated times.
*  Thank you guys for being here.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Now, let's just note here, this isn't just any player at NBC.
*  Chuck Todd is obviously a major news name at the network.
*  And him doing this appears to just open the floodgates across the entire NBC news brand,
*  especially on its sister cable network, MSNBC.
*  And where I said I'd never seen anything like what I saw on Meet the Press that
*  morning, I'd never seen anything like this either, because now the entire MSNBC
*  lineup is in open rebellion.
*  I mean, from the minute that the sun comes up.
*  There is Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.
*  We weren't asked our opinion of the hiring, but if we were, we would have strongly
*  objected to it for several reasons.
*  They're on fire over this.
*  We believe NBC News should seek out conservative Republican voices, but it should
*  be conservative Republicans, not a person who used her position of power to be an
*  anti-democracy election denier.
*  But it rolls out across the entire schedule.
*  Because Rodham McDaniel has been a major peddler of the big lie.
*  Joy Reid.
*  The fact that Ms.
*  McDaniel is on the payroll at NBC News, to me, that is inexplicable.
*  I mean, you wouldn't hire a mobster to work at a DA's office.
*  Rachel Maddow devotes an entire half hour.
*  It's not about just being associated with Donald Trump and his time in the Republican
*  Party. It's not even about lying or not lying.
*  It's about our system of government.
*  Thumbing her noses at her bosses and basically accusing them of abetting a traitorous figure
*  in American history.
*  I mean, just extraordinary stuff.
*  It's television history.
*  And let's face it, we journalists, our bosses know we can be seen as crybabies and we're
*  paid complainers.
*  We're convicts.
*  That's what we're paid to do.
*  But in this case, the NBC executives cannot ignore this because in the outcry, there's
*  a very clear point that they're all making.
*  Rodham McDaniel is not just a voice from the other side.
*  She was a fundamental part of Trump's efforts to denigrate the president.
*  This is not inviting the other side.
*  This is someone who's on the wrong side of history, of these moments that we've covered
*  and are still covering.
*  Right.
*  And I think it's fair to say that at this point, everyone understands that Rodham McDaniel's
*  time at NBC News is going to be very short lived.
*  Yeah, basically, after all this, the executives at NBC have to face facts.
*  It's over.
*  And on Tuesday night, they release a statement saying that they're going to be the next
*  president of the United States.
*  And on Tuesday night, they release a statement to the staff saying as much.
*  They don't cite the questions about red lines or what Rodham McDaniel represented or didn't
*  represent. They just say, we need to have a unified newsroom.
*  We want cohesion.
*  This isn't working.
*  I think in the end, she was a paid contributor for four days.
*  Yeah, one of the shortest tenures in television news history.
*  And look, in one respect, by their standards, this is kind of a pretty small contract.
*  A few hundred thousand dollars they may have to pay out.
*  But it was way more costly because they hired her.
*  They brought her on board because they wanted to appeal to these tens of millions of
*  Americans who still love Donald J.
*  Trump. And what happens now is that this entire thing is blown up in their face.
*  And those very same people now see a network that in their view, in the view of
*  Republicans across the country, this network will not accept any Republican.
*  So it becomes more about that.
*  And Fox News, NBC's longtime rival, goes wall to wall with this.
*  Now, NBC News just caved to the breathless demands from their far left, frankly,
*  emotionally unhinged host.
*  I mean, I had it on my desk all day.
*  And every minute I looked at that screen, it was pounding on these liberals at
*  NBC News, driving this Republican out.
*  It's the shortest tenure in TV history, I think.
*  But why? Well, because she supports Donald Trump, period.
*  So in a way, this leaves NBC worse off with that Trump Republican audience they had
*  wanted to court than maybe even they were before.
*  It's like a boomerang with a grenade on it.
*  Yeah, like it completely explodes in their face.
*  And that's why, to me, the whole episode is so representative of this eight year
*  conundrum for the news media, especially on television.
*  They still haven't been able to crack the code for how to handle the Trump
*  movement, the Trump candidacy and what it has wrought on the American political
*  system and American journalism.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Jim, put into context this painful episode at NBC into that larger conundrum
*  you just diagnosed that the media has faced when it comes to Trump.
*  Well, Michael, it's been there from the very beginning, from the very beginning
*  of his political rise.
*  The media was on this kind of seesaw.
*  You know, they go back and forth over how to cover him.
*  Sometimes they want to cover him quite aggressively because he's such a
*  challenging candidate.
*  He was very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
*  bursting so many norms.
*  But at other times there was this instinct to understand his appeal for the same
*  reason.
*  He's such an unusual candidate.
*  So there was a great desire to really understand his voters and frankly, to
*  speak to his voters because they're part of the audience.
*  And we all lived it, right?
*  But just let me take you back anyway, because everything's fresh again with
*  perspective.
*  And so if you go back, you know, let's look at when he first ran the networks,
*  if you recall, saw him as almost like a novelty candidate.
*  He was going to spice up what was expected to be a boring campaign between
*  the usual suspects.
*  And he was at ratings magnet and the networks, they just couldn't get enough
*  of it.
*  And they allowed him at times to really shatter their own norms.
*  Welcome back to Meet the Press, sir.
*  Good morning, Chuck.
*  Good morning.
*  Let me start.
*  He was able to just call into the studio and riff with the likes of the
*  George Stephanopoulos and Chuck Todd.
*  It can be true.
*  What does it have to do with him?
*  He can't talk about me because nobody respects women more than Donald Trump.
*  And CNN gave him a lot of unmitigated airtime.
*  If you recall, during the campaign, they would run the press conferences.
*  It's the largest winery on the East Coast.
*  I own it 100%.
*  And let him promote his Trump steaks and his Trump wine.
*  Trump steaks.
*  Where are the steaks?
*  Do we have steaks?
*  I mean, it got that crazy.
*  But again, the ratings were huge.
*  And then he wins.
*  And because they had previously given him all that airtime, they've in retrospect
*  sort of given him a political gift.
*  And more than that, now have a journalistic imperative to really address him in a
*  different way, to cover him as they would have covered any other candidate, which
*  let's face it, they weren't doing initially.
*  So there's sort of this extra motivation to make up for lost ground and maybe for
*  some journalistic omissions.
*  Right.
*  Kind of correct for the lack of a rigorous journalistic filter in the campaign.
*  Exactly.
*  And the big thing that this will be remembered for us, we're going to call a lie a lie.
*  I don't want to sugarcoat this because facts matter.
*  And the fact is, President Trump lies.
*  Trump lies.
*  We're going to say it's a lie.
*  I think we can't just meant surround it because they are lies.
*  And so we need to call them what they are.
*  And I.
*  We're no longer going to use euphemisms or, you know, looser language.
*  We're going to call it for what it is.
*  Trump lies and tweets.
*  He spreads false information at rallies.
*  He lies when he doesn't need to.
*  You know, he lies when the truth is more than enough for him.
*  CNN was running chyrons that would fact check Trump and call lies lies on the screen
*  while Trump is talking.
*  They were challenging Trump to his face.
*  One of the statements that you made in the tail end of the campaign in midterms that
*  is, well, if you don't mind, Mr.
*  President, that this caravan was an invasion.
*  In these crazy press conferences.
*  There are hundreds of miles away, there are hundreds and hundreds of miles away.
*  That's not an invasion.
*  Honestly, I think you should let me run the country.
*  You run CNN.
*  And if you did it well, your ratings would be much better.
*  If I may ask one other question, Mr.
*  President, if I may ask one other question, are you worried?
*  That's enough.
*  That's enough.
*  And Trump is giving it right back.
*  I'll tell you what, CNN should be ashamed of itself, having you working for them.
*  You are a rude, terrible person.
*  You shouldn't be working for CNN.
*  Very combative.
*  So this was this incredibly fraught moment for the American press.
*  You've got tens of millions of Trump supporters seeing what's really basic
*  fact checking these look like attacks to Trump supporters.
*  Trump in turn is calling the press, the reporters are enemies of the people.
*  So it's a terrible dynamic.
*  And when January 6th happens, it's so obviously out of control.
*  And what the traditional press that follows traditional journalistic rules has
*  to do is make it clear that the claims that Trump is making about a stolen
*  election are just so abjectly false that they don't warrant a single minute of
*  real consideration once the reporting has been done to show how false they are.
*  And I think that American journalism really emerged from that feeling strongly
*  about its own values and its own place in society.
*  But then, you know, there are still tens of millions of Trump voters and they
*  don't feel so good about the coverage.
*  And they don't agree that January 6th was an insurrection.
*  And so we enter yet another period where the press is going to have to
*  now maybe rethink some things.
*  In what way?
*  Well, there's a kind of quiet period after January 6th.
*  Trump is off of social media.
*  The smoke is literally dissipating from the air in Washington and news
*  executives are kind of standing there on the proverbial battlefield, taking
*  a new sort of look at their situation.
*  And they're seeing that in this clear light, they've got some new problems.
*  Perhaps none more important for their entire business models than that
*  their ratings are quickly crashing.
*  And part of that diminishment is that a huge part of the country that Trump
*  loving part of the audience is really now severed from their coverage.
*  They see the press as actually in some cases being complicit in stealing an
*  election and so these news executives, again, especially on television, which
*  is so ratings dependent, they've got a problem.
*  So after presumably learning all these lessons about journalism and how to
*  confront power, there's a first subtle and then much less subtle rethinking.
*  Maybe we need to pull back from that approach and maybe we need to take some
*  new lessons and switch it up a little bit and reverse some of what we did.
*  And one of the best examples of this is none other than CNN.
*  It had come under new management, was being led by a guy named Chris Licht, a
*  veteran of cable news, but also Stephen Colbert's late night show, been his last
*  job and his new job under this new management is we're going to recalibrate
*  a little bit.
*  So Chris Licht proceeds to try to bring the network back to the center.
*  And how does he do that?
*  Well, we see some key personalities who sort of represented the Trump combat
*  era start losing air time and some of them lose their jobs.
*  There's talk of, we want more Republicans on the air.
*  There was a famous magazine article about Chris Licht's balancing act here.
*  And Chris Licht says to a reporter, Tim Alberta of the Atlantic magazine, look, a
*  lot in the media, including at his own network, quote unquote, put on a jersey.
*  Took a side.
*  They took a side.
*  And he says, I think we understand that Jersey cannot go back on because he says
*  in the end of the day, by the way, it didn't even work.
*  We didn't change anyone's mind.
*  He's saying that confrontational approach that defined the four years Trump was in
*  office, that was a reaction to the feeling that TV news had failed to properly treat
*  Trump with sufficient skepticism, that that actually was a failure both of
*  journalism and of the TV news business.
*  Is that what he's saying?
*  Yeah.
*  On the business side, it's easier call, right?
*  You want a bigger audience.
*  You want a bigger audience and you're not getting the bigger audience, but he's
*  making a journalistic argument as well.
*  That if the job is to convey the truth and take it to the people so that they, and
*  they take that into account as they make their own voting decisions and formulate
*  their own opinions about American politics.
*  If tens of millions of people who do believe that election was stolen are completely
*  tuning you out because now they see you as a political combatant, you're not
*  achieving your ultimate goal as a journalist.
*  And what does Licks don't put a Jersey back on approach look like on CNN for its
*  viewers?
*  Wow.
*  It did look good.
*  People might remember this, but the most glaring example.
*  Please welcome the front runner for the Republican nomination for
*  president, Donald Trump.
*  Was when he held a town hall meeting featuring Donald J.
*  Trump, now candidate Trump before an audience packed with Trump's fans.
*  When you look at what happened during that election, unless you're a very stupid
*  person, you see what happens.
*  A lot of the people.
*  Trump let loose a string of falsehoods.
*  Most people understand what happened.
*  That was a rigged election.
*  The audience, this pro-Trump audience was cheering him on.
*  Are you ready?
*  Can I talk?
*  Yeah.
*  What's the answer?
*  Can you do mine?
*  I would like for you to answer the question.
*  It's very simple to answer.
*  Why ask that?
*  It's very simple to you.
*  You're a nasty person.
*  I'll tell you.
*  And jeering the CNN anchor hosting this, Caitlin Collins, on CNN's own air, it was
*  it was a disaster.
*  Right.
*  It felt like a callback to the unlearned lessons of 2016.
*  Yeah.
*  And in this case, CNN staff was up in arms.
*  Big shakeup in the cable news industry as CNN makes another change at the top.
*  Chris Licht is officially out at CNN after a chaotic run as chairman and
*  CEO.
*  And Chris Licht didn't survive it.
*  The chief executive's departure comes as he faced criticism in recent weeks
*  after the network hosted a town hall with Donald Trump and the network's
*  ratings started to drop.
*  But I want to say that the CNN leadership still, even after that, as they brought
*  new leadership in, said this is still the path we're going to go on.
*  Maybe that didn't work out, but we're still here.
*  This is still what we have to do.
*  Right.
*  And this idea is very much in the water of TV news.
*  That this is the right overall direction.
*  Yeah.
*  This is by no means isolated to CNN.
*  This is throughout the traditional news business.
*  These conversations are happening everywhere, but CNN was living it at that point.
*  And this of course is how we get to NBC deciding to hire Ruana McDaniel.
*  Right.
*  Cause they're picking up right where that conversation leaves off.
*  They're having the same conversation.
*  But for NBC, you could argue this tension between journalistic values and audience.
*  It's even more pressing because even though MSNBC is a niche cable network, NBC news
*  is part of an old fashioned broadcast network.
*  It's on television stations throughout the country.
*  And in fact, those networks, they still have 630 newscasts.
*  And believe it or not, millions of people still watch those every night.
*  Maybe not as many as they used to, but there are still some six or seven million
*  people tuning in tonightly news.
*  That's important.
*  Right.
*  We should say that kind of number is sometimes double or triple that of the cable news
*  primetime shows that get all the attention.
*  On their best nights.
*  So this is, this is big business still.
*  And that business is based on broad.
*  It's called broadcast for a reason.
*  That's based on broad audiences.
*  So NBC had a business imperative and they argue they had a journalistic imperative.
*  So given all of that, Jim, I think the big messy question here is when it comes to NBC,
*  did they make a tactical error around hiring the wrong Republican, which blew up, or did
*  they make an even larger error in thinking that the way you handle Trump and his supporters
*  is to work this hard to reach them when they might not even be reachable.
*  The best way to answer that question is to tell you what they're saying right now.
*  NBC management, but management saying is, yes, this was a tactical error.
*  This was clearly the wrong Republican.
*  We get it.
*  But they're saying we are going to, and they said this in their statement, announcing
*  that they were severing ties with McDaniel.
*  They said, we're going to redouble our efforts to represent a broad spectrum of the
*  American votership.
*  And that's what they meant was that we're going to still try to reach these Trump
*  voters with people who can relate to them and they can relate to.
*  But the question is, how do you even do that when so many of the supporters believe a
*  lie? How is NBC?
*  How is CNN?
*  How are any of these TV networks, if they have decided that this is their mission, how
*  are they supposed to speak to people who believe something fundamentally untrue as a
*  core part of their political identity?
*  That's the catch-22.
*  How do you get that Trump movement person who's also an insider when the litmus test
*  to be an insider in the Trump movement is to believe in the denialism or at least say
*  you do. So that's a real journalistic problem.
*  And the thing that we haven't really touched here is what are these networks doing day
*  in and day out? They're not producing reported pieces, which I where I think it's a
*  little easier. You just report the news.
*  You go out into the world, talk to people, and then you present it to the world as a
*  nuanced portrait of the country.
*  Right. This thing is true. This thing is false.
*  Again, in many cases, pretty straightforward.
*  But their bread and butter is talking heads.
*  It's live. It's not edited.
*  It's not that much reported.
*  So their whole business model, especially again on cable, which has 24 hours to fill,
*  is talking heads. And if you want the perspective from the Trump movement.
*  Journalistically, especially when it comes to denialism, but when it comes to some other
*  major subjects in American life, you're walking into a place where they're going to say
*  things that aren't true.
*  It don't pass your journalistic standards, the most basic standards of journalism.
*  Right. So you're saying if TV sticks with this model, the kind of low cost, lots of
*  talk approach to news, then they are going to have to solve the riddle of who to bring
*  on, who represents Trump's America if they want that audience.
*  And now they've got this red line that they've established that that person can't be
*  someone who denies the 2020 election reality.
*  But like you just said, that's the litmus test for being in Trump's orbit.
*  So this doesn't really look like a conundrum.
*  This looks like a bit of a crisis for TV news because it may end up meaning that they
*  can't hire that person that they need for this model, which means that perhaps a
*  network like NBC does need to wave goodbye to a big segment of these viewers and these
*  eyeballs who support Trump.
*  I mean, on the one hand, they are not ready to do that and they would never concede that
*  that's something they're ready to do.
*  The problem is, barring some kind of change in their news model, there's no solution to
*  this. But why bar changes to their news model, I guess is the question.
*  Because over the years, it's gotten more and more expensive to produce news, the news
*  that I'm talking about, like recorded packages and what we refer to as reporting.
*  Just go out and report the news.
*  Don't gab about it.
*  Just what's going on?
*  What's true?
*  What's false?
*  That's actually very expensive in television and they don't have the kind of money they
*  used to have. So the talking heads is their way to do programming at a level where they
*  can afford it. They do some packages.
*  60 minutes still does incredible work.
*  NBC does packages, but the lion's share of what they do is what we're talking about.
*  And that's not going to change because the economics aren't there.
*  So then a final option, of course, to borrow something Chris Licht said, is that a
*  network like NBC perhaps doesn't put a jersey on, but accepts the reality that a lot of
*  the world sees them wearing a jersey.
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, nobody wants to be seen as wearing a jersey in our business.
*  No one wants to be wearing a jersey in our business, but maybe what they really have
*  to accept is that we're just sticking to the true facts.
*  And that may look like we're wearing a jersey, but we're not.
*  And that may at times look like it's lining up more with the Democrats, but we're not.
*  If Trump is lying about a stolen election, that's not siding against him.
*  That's siding for the truth.
*  And that's what we're doing.
*  Easier said than done.
*  And I don't think any of these concepts are new.
*  I think there have been attempts to do that, but it's the world they're in and it's the
*  only option they really have.
*  We're going to tell you the truth, even if it means that we're going to lose a big part
*  of the country.
*  Well, Jim, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Don't do it!
*  Don't do it!
*  Don't do it!
*  Over the weekend, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem
*  in some of the largest domestic demonstrations against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
*  Netanyahu since Israel invaded Gaza in the fall.
*  Some of the protesters called on Netanyahu to reach a ceasefire deal that would free
*  the hostages taken by Hamas on October 7.
*  Others called for early elections that would remove Netanyahu from office.
*  During a news conference on Sunday, Netanyahu rejected calls for early elections, saying
*  they would paralyze his government at a crucial moment in the war.
