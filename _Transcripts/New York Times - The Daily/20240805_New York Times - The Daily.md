# She Used to Be Friends With JD Vance
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBT1cMhjdcE)
*  Sophia, can I ask you to read this email from JD Vance, starting with the date?
*  Okay.
*  June 29th, 2016.
*  Hey, Sophs.
*  Here is an excerpt from my book.
*  I send this to you not just to brag, but because I'm sure if you read it, you'll notice reference
*  to an extremely progressive lesbian.
*  I'm sure most readers will have no idea who it refers to, but you will.
*  I recognize now that this may not accurately reflect how you think of yourself, and for
*  that I'm really sorry.
*  I hope you're not offended.
*  Love you, JD.
*  And can you read your reply to that email?
*  Hey, buddy.
*  First of all, congratulations.
*  Second, thank you for reaching out and being sweet.
*  Third, it'd take a lot more to offend me than that.
*  How do you think I survived growing up in a similar place as you, gasp even going to
*  public school as a half-Mexican, non-evangelical tomboy?
*  While we see and care about many of the same problems, I know we often come to different
*  conclusions about how to best address them.
*  But what I value in you is your genuineness, curiosity, kindness, and desire to make a
*  difference.
*  And I consider you a great friend.
*  Love, Sophia.
*  How does it make you feel to read those exchanges now?
*  This relationship we had of mutual respect across the political divide has completely
*  vanished.
*  And I think it's sad for me personally, but I think it's also sad for the country.
*  Why sad for you personally?
*  It's heartbreaking to see somebody you respected and cared about turn on you and your neighbors,
*  especially in the context of knowing that's not who he was.
*  That's disappointing to see anyone do, obviously.
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  As JD Vance has dramatically transformed himself from a vocal Trump critic into a Trump-style
*  candidate and now into Trump's running mate, few people have witnessed that change from
*  up than Vance's friend from law school, Sophia Nelson.
*  Over the past week, Nelson has decided to speak out against Vance, a decision that began
*  when she gave the Times a trove of personal correspondence with Vance from their years-long
*  friendship.
*  Today, I speak with Nelson about what exactly she's doing, why she decided to do it, and
*  what she's learned about who JD Vance really is.
*  It's Monday, August 5th.
*  So, I want to better understand the story of what happened to your relationship with
*  JD Vance and what ultimately led you over the past few weeks to share a lot of your
*  personal emails and messages that you exchanged with Vance with the New York Times.
*  I want to start with the story of your friendship.
*  When did you first meet JD Vance?
*  JD and I met in the fall of 2010 during orientation at Yale Law School.
*  We were both assigned to the same small group, which is 16 individuals.
*  And so we took all of our first semester courses together, and we were encouraged by the university
*  to bond with that small group.
*  They did so much as pay for us to essentially socialize together.
*  So we spent a great deal of time together in that first semester, and we bonded over
*  being from the Midwest, coming from working-class communities, going to public school K-12,
*  which is not the norm at Yale Law School.
*  Right.
*  There's a lot of people who go to very fancy private schools.
*  Most people at Yale Law School are coastal elites, and so JD and I are not those things.
*  JD grew up in Middletown, Ohio.
*  I grew up in Wayland, Michigan.
*  And the collapse of the auto industry in 2007, 2008 devastated my hometown.
*  And obviously, the opioid epidemic that came after that has similarly wreaked havoc.
*  And we bonded over that.
*  I think we both, you know, we're a little shocked by the level of wealth and nepotism
*  present at these elite universities.
*  I remember he was deeply hurt by a comment that one of our professors made that people
*  who went to state schools tended to perform less well in the Yale Law School environment.
*  Because he had gone to a state school.
*  Right.
*  He had gone to Ohio State.
*  And my reaction was, JD, this man is so out of touch.
*  He won't listen to anything he has to say.
*  Obviously, there's no monopoly on intelligence by the Ivy Leagues.
*  Do you remember what he said in response when you tried to console him?
*  I think he was hell-bent on proving them wrong, which was totally within his right.
*  And I think he was very successful at that.
*  What was his personality in this place?
*  Just give us a sense of him.
*  I mean, the JD that I became friends with was sarcastic, incredibly curious, motivated.
*  And he loved talking with everyone he could get his hands on about political philosophy
*  and the political issues of our time.
*  And I loved doing the same thing.
*  I thought JD and I shared a curiosity and a commitment to talking across difference
*  and a desire to solve real problems.
*  My parents and my friends from home are so surprised that, oh, this person that you've
*  connected with is on the opposite end of the political spectrum from you.
*  And I was like, yeah, but culturally, we're very similar.
*  And how would you describe his political views at the time?
*  Where was he then on the ideological continuum?
*  I mean, he was a bit of an iconoclast, right?
*  He wasn't necessarily beholden to a specific ideology at the time.
*  I thought he was somewhat creative in his thinking.
*  He was a voracious reader.
*  He was a conservative who was disillusioned with the culture wars and thought that they
*  were destructive and a distraction.
*  It's interesting that you said he's disillusioned with the culture wars.
*  And just to make sure I understand that, he just doesn't think there's much point in
*  having long battles about questions of sexuality or identity.
*  That just didn't feel useful to him.
*  That was my belief at the time.
*  And he certainly had a diverse group of friends.
*  I think he was skeptical of the identity politics of the left.
*  He just didn't understand why that needed to be a main topic of conversation.
*  Because why can't we just get to know a person for who they are?
*  And Sophia, how did you identify at the time during this period of law school?
*  He called you a progressive lesbian in his book, which I take it from his wording is
*  not quite accurate.
*  Yeah, I certainly identified as a progressive and still do.
*  However, lesbian was not the word that I would have used to describe myself at the
*  time nor do I use that word now.
*  And I have a trans identity and a queer identity.
*  Labels are not that important to me and I wasn't offended when he called me a lesbian
*  and I wouldn't be offended if someone called me a lesbian today.
*  As long as people are well intentioned, the language that they use is not going to set
*  me off.
*  Well, given that, I'm curious how he felt about you and your identity in this period.
*  Was that ever tense or in any way awkward?
*  Did his politics ever become in conflict with who you were?
*  Absolutely not.
*  You know, my partner at the time was a woman and we were invited to their wedding and we
*  went together.
*  To the wedding of JD Vance and his now wife.
*  Yes.
*  And when we spoke, even after law school, he would ask me how she was doing.
*  He showed interest in, you know, cared about my relationship and my wellbeing and I cared
*  about his.
*  And, you know, Usha was also in our small group.
*  His wife.
*  Yes.
*  And I don't think it even crossed their mind to care if someone was gay or trans or you
*  just get to know people for who they are.
*  And I had gender affirming surgery in 2012 while I was in law school.
*  My partner at the time emailed my closest friends, letting them know that that's what
*  I was doing and that, you know, when I came back to school, it would be really nice if,
*  you know, they supported me in my recovery.
*  And that was very sweet of her to do that.
*  And I remember him bringing me baked goods and we had a brief conversation that was essentially
*  like, I don't really know what top surgery is or why you did that, but, you know, whatever
*  you need to do to be happy, like I support you essentially.
*  And it meant a lot to me because, you know, I obviously had a lot of, or maybe it's not
*  obvious, but I had a lot of queer friends in law school and I didn't need to do a lot
*  of explaining about why I was getting surgery to them.
*  And JD wasn't asking me to explain either.
*  I don't need anyone to understand, you know, why I needed to get surgery or exactly the
*  complexity of my identities if they can treat me with respect and kindness.
*  So you and JD Vance both graduate from Yale Law School.
*  You both leave New Haven.
*  You become this public defender in Detroit.
*  He goes off to a law firm.
*  Did you think that you would stay close and keep in touch?
*  Yes, I did.
*  He challenged me intellectually and I felt like we both benefited from discussing current
*  events and ideas, knowing that we wouldn't usually agree.
*  I really thought JD helped me think carefully about the issues that I was seeing in my work.
*  And I was hopeful that I was doing the same for him.
*  You were making each other smarter and sharper.
*  I want to talk about that because I've now looked at this correspondence that you shared
*  with The Times that occurs after law school.
*  And you two very much become adult pen pals, right?
*  You're kind of processing everything in the world.
*  Some of the most divisive subjects of our time, you talk about race, policing, affirmative
*  action, and as makes sense given what we've talked about here, you come at them from different
*  perspectives but you're both trying to find a lot of common ground and you often do.
*  And I'm curious, what do you remember most from those exchanges?
*  What stands out to you from them?
*  It gave me hope because at the time our politics was starting to shift nationally away from
*  any desire to build consensus.
*  His thoughtfulness and our relationship gave me hope that that wasn't a lost cause.
*  Do you mind if I engage with some of the specific things he said in those emails?
*  Because I think it will help listeners get a feel for what he's saying and better understand
*  your reactions to them.
*  Yes.
*  Let me start with the post Michael Brown exchanges that you guys are having.
*  Yes.
*  He writes to you that he thinks it's important that there be greater accountability for police
*  officers.
*  And he writes, quote, I love the body camera movement and anything that puts cops back
*  in the mindset of service and protection instead of control and coercion.
*  And he goes on to say, I hate the police.
*  Given the number of negative experiences I've had in the past few years, I can't imagine
*  what a black guy goes through.
*  And then he talks to you about the subject of that horrible mass shooting in Charleston.
*  And he expresses bewilderment that anyone would ever try to disentangle the presence
*  flag over the South Carolina State House from what happened in that shooting.
*  And he talks to you about reparations for black Americans.
*  And he says, quote, I will say this, whatever practical or moral problems I have with compensating
*  the ancestors of slaves or compensating, quote, black people as a giant collective, I have
*  at least been convinced of the virtue of compensating modern victims who suffered from redlining
*  or denial of federal benefits or something similar.
*  It makes sense to me, he tells you, that black veterans who never got their GI bill benefits
*  are owed something.
*  I mean, these are very moderate, highly nuanced, compassionate viewpoints.
*  Completely.
*  I remember responding specifically to the reparations discussion because I had sent
*  him Ta-Nehisi Coates' piece in the Atlantic.
*  And that was what launched this conversation.
*  I responded something long lines of, I think that's really big.
*  If you, conservative JD Vance, now see that the government has taken action to, in modern
*  times, widen the wealth gap between white and black Americans through policy and that
*  the government needs to take action to remedy that.
*  And he was like, well, it shouldn't be.
*  I want to talk specifically about Donald Trump because one thing that really stands out in
*  your emails with JD Vance is how much you two agree on Donald Trump as he emerges onto
*  the political scene.
*  This is 2015, 2016.
*  How did he represent his feelings about Trump in that period?
*  The public record on this is extensive and it's no different from what he said to me
*  personally, which is a recognition that Trump was flinging the flames of racism.
*  And he was very concerned about the effect of that rhetoric on people's sense of feeling
*  included in their country and their own personal safety.
*  That came up and, you know, I live in Detroit, Metro Detroit houses the largest Muslim population
*  in the United States.
*  And one of my friends at the time told me that some of the women in her life that wear
*  hijab were feeling as harassed and scared around Trump's rhetoric, doing basic things
*  like going to the grocery store as they had felt in the wake of 9-11.
*  And you told him that?
*  I did.
*  And he responded with empathy and concern.
*  Right.
*  In his emails to you, he's pretty unambiguous in his disgust for Trump in this period.
*  I mean, he writes to you that Trump is a disaster.
*  He actually says a effing disaster.
*  He calls him a bad man and quote, a morally reprehensible human being.
*  What did you think about that?
*  I thought it reflected his core values.
*  While we differed on tax policy and how big or small government should be, we agreed that
*  nobody should be vilified and dehumanized and that talking about Americans or non-Americans
*  in callous and cruel terms was amoral, right?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  I mean, I don't know Donald Trump, right?
*  I'm sure he has things I could find to love about him if I was his family member or friend.
*  But the moral injury that his rhetoric has wrecked on this country is devastating.
*  And JD and I agreed on that at the time.
*  I mean, we shared a belief that what Donald Trump was trying to do was morally reprehensible
*  and dangerous.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So after Trump was elected, was there a point where you noticed that the kinds of conversations
*  that you had been having with JD Vance and the JD Vance you were starting to see out
*  in the world were diverging?
*  It wasn't until 2020.
*  His tone on Twitter started changing.
*  How so?
*  He started name calling.
*  He started adopting Donald Trump's style of speak.
*  And it's just not at all reflective of the person I had gotten to know.
*  And it was concerning.
*  Do you remember specifically the names he called?
*  Well, I certainly remember the childless cat lady comments.
*  ...childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've
*  made.
*  And so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too.
*  And the idea that people who don't have children don't have a meaningful stake in the country.
*  When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power.
*  You shouldn't have the same voting rights as people with children.
*  If you don't have as much of an investment in the future of this country, maybe you shouldn't
*  get nearly the same voice.
*  And then he started making really cruel comments about abortion.
*  Yeah, I mean, I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.
*  He came out opposing abortion in cases of rape and incest.
*  And when we talked about abortion in law school, JD was deeply uncomfortable with the concept
*  of abortion.
*  What he relayed to me is what his grandmother had taught him, which is that you can never
*  know what situation a woman is in when she's making that difficult decision.
*  And it's not the government's business, essentially.
*  And I think he was really struggling with whether he agreed with his grandmother or
*  not.
*  But his extreme opinions started developing in 2020.
*  And when he came out in support of a ban on gender affirming care in 2021 that was introduced
*  in Arkansas, I reached out to him directly.
*  When someone is trying to strip you of your political and civil rights, and you have their
*  cell phone number, at least I felt like I needed to text him about it, and I did.
*  And what did you say to him?
*  I asked him if he supported these laws.
*  These are bans on gender affirming care for children, specifically the Arkansas bill.
*  Yes.
*  And we went back and forth.
*  And he acknowledged that it was awkward, but then explained to me that he thought it was
*  experimentation and that I had been brainwashed by Jeff Bezos.
*  And I mean, it was just the tenor of the conversation was completely anathema to the tenor of our
*  previous conversations.
*  Right.
*  And I've read this text exchange.
*  And whereas almost all of your previous messages are two generous people working through tough
*  stuff, right?
*  This one feels like that dynamic is kind of unraveling.
*  And you say to him at one point in this exchange, quote, the political voice you have become
*  seems so, so far from the man I got to know in law school.
*  And JD Vance replies to you, I will always love you.
*  But I really do think the left's cultural progressivism is making it harder for normal
*  people to live their lives.
*  And that back and forth feels like it marks a change in your relationship.
*  It was incredibly different.
*  And it was incredibly painful and hurtful.
*  This division of Americans that he has embraced of normal people and everyone else.
*  I am a normal person.
*  Queer people are normal Americans.
*  I don't whatever.
*  I don't divide the world between normal and abnormal people.
*  I don't think that helps anyone.
*  And in a lot of ways, I think I lead a much more average life than he does.
*  I am not a millionaire.
*  I lead a private existence.
*  And specifically the term normal really scared me because he has set up a war between, quote,
*  normal people and those who are trying to attack them.
*  You know, I shared some pretty personal stuff with him about my experience as a trans kid.
*  Because I know what it's like to sit and cry as a kid and think, I have to fix myself.
*  There's no way that I can be this person and be loved and have a job and be accepted and
*  be OK.
*  And that is a devastating experience.
*  And I was so hopeful that it would be easier for future generations.
*  And what I was seeing JD engage in is something that was even scarier than what I grew up
*  with.
*  And so I felt personally betrayed, but also very fearful.
*  And the hope that I was talking about before that our correspondence gave me sunk.
*  Could you believe that you were having that conversation?
*  I believe that the man that I used to know was gone.
*  So of course, what happens next is that Vance is catapulted into his political career.
*  He makes peace with Trump, apologizes to Trump, embraces Trump, runs for Senate in Ohio.
*  Yeah, and I obviously followed what was happening in the Ohio race.
*  And I chose not to say anything at that time.
*  My classmate Josh McLaurin leaked a message where JD had privately referred to Donald
*  Trump as America's Hitler.
*  And obviously I had similar things in my possession.
*  But I didn't feel compelled to act at that time, which maybe was a lack of moral courage
*  on my part.
*  Or lingering affection?
*  Probably that too, yeah.
*  I think it's still hard for me because I have a lot of fond memories about him and his wife.
*  And I still care about him on some level.
*  And I didn't want to betray him.
*  And I think maybe I still held on some hope.
*  Okay, so once he's doing this to get elected and maybe once he's in office, we'll see some
*  moderation.
*  But that obviously hasn't happened.
*  If anything, he's gone farther to the right.
*  And so tonight, Mr. Chairman, I stand here humbled and I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
*  to say I officially accept your nomination to be vice president of the United States
*  of America.
*  And every single day for the next four years when I walk into that White House to help
*  President Trump, I will be doing it for you, for your family, for your future and for this
*  great country.
*  Thank you.
*  God bless all of you and God bless our great country.
*  I want to talk about what it means for Vance to become Trump's running mate.
*  Because in talking to you about the emails you guys exchanged in those years after law
*  school, it's hard not to recognize the ways in which being Trump's running mate means
*  that he's aligning himself with positions that are very much at odds with what he said
*  to you in some of those emails, right?
*  I mean, Trump is someone who tolerates zero questioning of the police.
*  Trump is someone who says that the Confederate flag is a proud symbol of the US.
*  That's so different from the way JD Vance talked to you about the Confederate flag in
*  Charleston, so different from what he said to you about hating the police and being skeptical
*  of them.
*  And it goes on and on, the divergences.
*  And so it's once Vance becomes Trump's running mate that you do start to entertain the idea
*  that these correspondents should become public.
*  Right.
*  People started reaching out to me saying that reporters were calling them, this was before
*  he was announced, and that they had shared my name with reporters as someone who might
*  have some information.
*  And I kind of took the approach of, well, if a reporter calls me, I'll cross that bridge
*  when I come to it.
*  And eventually a reporter did call me.
*  My colleague Stephanie Saul.
*  Correct.
*  And I had a great deal of back and forth with Stephanie.
*  I talked with my partner.
*  I talked with my parents.
*  And then I called a close friend from elementary school who's an independent voter, someone
*  I have an immense amount of respect for.
*  A single mom living in rural America trying to do her best.
*  And I wanted her opinion.
*  And what did she say?
*  She said that she votes for people based on their character and that she thinks that this
*  was important information.
*  But she also understood why I was really hesitant to share it.
*  Ultimately, that she thought that was important information was really crucial in my decision.
*  I think the importance of the correspondence and why I made them public is that JD has
*  tried to explain why he changed his mind on Donald Trump.
*  But I think what the American people deserve to know is that he has changed his position
*  on every conceivable issue that affects everyday Americans.
*  And the timing of those changes line up with his attempt to rise in the MAGA movement.
*  So they're indicative of someone who's willing to turn their back on their core values in
*  order to amass money and power.
*  And I think that reflects a lack of integrity that isn't something that people want in their leaders.
*  It's one thing to evolve your opinion on certain issues when you get new information.
*  It's a completely separate thing to transform your personality and change your position
*  on every conceivable issue in order to advance your career.
*  And so it's the integrity, it's the being a political chameleon that I think people
*  deserve to know.
*  You have clearly concluded that JD Vance's transformation was not organic.
*  You see it as a story of ambition overtaking conviction.
*  But I want to talk about a different possibility or I guess a different interpretation of what's
*  happened here and arguably a more generous way of seeing what has happened to Vance.
*  And it's that people really do change and his beliefs have genuinely evolved because
*  of changes around him, because of forces that are present now that weren't.
*  When I try to make sense of how Vance himself describes his transformation, what I hear
*  him saying, and I wonder if you hear him saying it too, is that liberal policies, top-down
*  liberal approaches to issues like how to handle race, how to handle diversity, how Americans
*  should talk about sexuality and gender, that those have become dogmatic and that he doesn't
*  think they've given Americans a space to think for themselves.
*  And that is how he is processing these changes.
*  And I wonder if you've given him the benefit of the doubt and tried to think about whether
*  that is the explanation.
*  I don't live in JD Vance's head so I can't definitively say what his motivations are.
*  I have certainly changed my mind about a number of things and I hope we all evolve and change
*  our minds.
*  It shows evolution, maturity.
*  Changing your mind with new information is a good thing.
*  But there's a difference between evolving and transforming on every conceivable issue
*  and again the way you talk about people.
*  I think the content of the emails is important, but also the nature of them.
*  The kindness, the mutual respect is completely gone from the way he speaks publicly.
*  And both of those things are important because the way we talk about people, especially the
*  way our leaders talk about people, has real impact on communities.
*  It gives everyday Americans and emboldens them to treat their neighbors with cruelty.
*  It diminishes our ability to have respectful conversations across difference.
*  And so it is very hard for me to imagine that you could transform on again every conceivable
*  political issue and also the way you talk about people different from you.
*  I have a final question for you.
*  What would you say to JD Vance if you felt you could talk to him right now?
*  If you could get past everything that's just happened and you could just the two of you
*  sit down for a coffee or a beer?
*  It's a really hard question.
*  I would ask him why he's so angry at everyday people who are different from him.
*  What about how I live my life makes it hard for normal people?
*  What did I do?
*  I truly don't know.
*  Well, Sophia, thank you so much for your time.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  In response to Sophia's decision to publicly share their correspondence, a spokesman for
*  JD Vance issued a statement.
*  Quote, it's unfortunate that this individual chose to leak decades old private conversations
*  between friends to the New York Times.
*  The statement said.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris met with three potential running mates to test
*  their personal chemistry, a sign that her search for a number two has entered its final phase.
*  Harris met with Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Pennsylvania
*  Governor Josh Shapiro at her home in Washington, D.C.
*  She's expected to announce her choice by tomorrow.
*  And Israel is bracing for a major retaliatory attack after its assassination last week of
*  high level leaders from both Hamas and Hezbollah.
*  At least four major airlines have suspended flights into and out of Israel for fear of
*  an aerial attack from Iran or Lebanon, the countries where the assassinations occurred.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Novitski, Alex Stern and Lindsay Garrison, with help from
*  Diana Nguyen and Rob Zipko.
*  It was edited by Ben Calhoun, with help from Paige Coward and Patricia Willis, contains
*  original music by Dan Powell and Rowan Numisto, and was engineered by Alyssa Moxley.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansferk of Wonderland.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  See you tomorrow.
