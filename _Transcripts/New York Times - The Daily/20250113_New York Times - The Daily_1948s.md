# Big Tech’s Big Bet on Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=4.34s)]
*  Big tech's biggest names are throwing their weight behind Donald Trump in the biggest [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=13.68s)]
*  possible way, first as candidate and now as president-elect. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=18.96s)]
*  Today, what one tech billionaire's journey from top-tier Democratic donor to Trump advisor [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=24.28s)]
*  reveals about the growing maugification of Silicon Valley. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=33.56s)]
*  It's Monday, January 13th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=45.2s)]
*  Aaron, welcome back. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=53.28s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=57.2s)]
*  You have been covering startups and Silicon Valley for a long time. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  And you know as well as anyone that by reputation, Silicon Valley is seen as a liberal bastion, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  a place where progressive thinking is nursed and promoted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=74.2s)]
*  But over the past year, especially during the presidential campaign, it really did feel [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=78.8s)]
*  like Silicon Valley's conservative self began to emerge. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=84.89999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  And it's true that Silicon Valley has historically been very liberal and there were plenty of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=92.0s)]
*  very well-known investors and founders who backed President Biden's campaign and then [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  Vice President Harris. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=102.92s)]
*  The thing that was different this time around was that some of the most prominent and influential [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=104.96s)]
*  people in the tech industry came out in support of Donald Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=111.24s)]
*  And this includes big-name venture capitalists like David Sacks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=115.8s)]
*  This includes Elon Musk. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=119.44s)]
*  And this includes a lot of other people that are very famous in the tech industry, but [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=121.24s)]
*  maybe not household names across the country. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=125.0s)]
*  And that has a little bit of a trickle-down effect where in the past, it may have been [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  taboo or absolutely impossible to say that you supported Trump or even that you're a [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=134.48s)]
*  Republican. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  Now, it's kind of a lot more common. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  You encounter it a lot more frequently and that's a huge change. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=143.56s)]
*  And so once Trump won the election, we've seen the industry go even further than merely [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  expressing support for him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=153.98s)]
*  They're making changes to their policies and their personnel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=156.28s)]
*  Over the past week, Metta, which is Facebook's parent company, said it is pulling back on [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=160.34s)]
*  fact-checking and policing disinformation on its platforms. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=165.06s)]
*  The company is also changing its board of directors. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=168.82s)]
*  They added Dana White, who is the CEO of USC and a big ally of Trump's to its board. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=172.02s)]
*  So these are all... [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=178.08s)]
*  We did a whole episode about him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=179.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=180.08s)]
*  So these are all moves that align with the incoming president and his base of support. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=181.08s)]
*  And Mark Zuckerberg even came out and said directly that he was doing this in response [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=186.9s)]
*  to what he saw as a cultural tipping point that the election represented. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=191.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=196.12s)]
*  Roughly translated, he's saying, we are doing this because of Trump's victory. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=197.12s)]
*  More or less. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=201.9s)]
*  And the question that that raises right away is, is this opportunism, is this big tech [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=203.22s)]
*  and Silicon Valley doing what a lot of profitable industries do when there's a new president, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=210.56s)]
*  which is seek friendly relationships with the new boss? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=216.24s)]
*  Or is this something deeper? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=221.3s)]
*  Is this the case of big tech's true political identity emerging from behind what may have [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=223.62s)]
*  been a cloak of liberalism? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=229.74s)]
*  It's kind of both in a way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=233.62s)]
*  It's partly a result of big tech becoming such a big and powerful industry. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  They're maturing. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=240.34s)]
*  They're growing up. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=241.34s)]
*  Just like any other industry that needs to get in good with regulators and push back [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  against regulation that they think will hinder their growth. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=247.68s)]
*  But at the same time, I think it's also kind of a cultural sea change for the tech industry. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  And it's being pushed forward by some of these really loud and influential voices that have [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=257.52s)]
*  just been kind of fed up with the direction that our broader culture, but also specifically [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=262.44s)]
*  tech culture, has been moving for the last 15 years. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=267.18s)]
*  And the tech leader who maybe embodies this transformation the most is a venture capital [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=271.52s)]
*  investor named Mark Andreessen. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=276.5s)]
*  Well tell us about Mark Andreessen and his shift. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=279.14s)]
*  Yeah, so he's really a titan of Silicon Valley. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=282.41999999999996s)]
*  He is the founder of a venture capital firm called Andreessen Horowitz that manages $44 [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=286.18s)]
*  billion. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  He has invested in some of the most prominent and successful startups to come out of Silicon [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=293.12s)]
*  Valley, you know, Pinterest, Slack, Airbnb, Coinbase. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=299.56s)]
*  He's on the board of Facebook. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  But more than that, he's kind of just like a VC thought leader who states his opinions [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=306.12s)]
*  very passionately and the industry really follows and is influenced by what he says. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=310.8s)]
*  He's also called himself a quote unquote normie Democrat for most of his life. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=317.8s)]
*  He supported all the way going back to Bill Clinton. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=323.06s)]
*  He supported Gore, Kerry, Obama, Hillary Clinton. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=326.32s)]
*  And so it was, you know, a little bit of a surprise when in 2024 he came out in support [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=330.82s)]
*  of Trump pretty loudly, donated money to the campaign. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=335.98s)]
*  And now that Trump's about to take office, he's been kind of a key advisor in the transition. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=340.12s)]
*  He's been spending a lot of time at Mar-a-Lago. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=346.42s)]
*  He's been recommending people from the tech industry to work for the new administration. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=349.02s)]
*  So how does Andreessen go from reliable normie Democrat to supporter and now advisor to Donald Trump? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=354.42s)]
*  For Andreessen, it starts with this concept that he calls the deal. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=363.16s)]
*  Mark Andreessen, welcome to Honestly. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=367.6s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=370.68s)]
*  I'm really happy to have you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=371.68s)]
*  And he's talked about this on a number of podcasts, including Barry Weiss's and Joe Rogan's. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  And what's the deal? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=377.42s)]
*  The deal was somebody like me basically could start a company. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  You can invent a new technology, in this case, you know, web browsers and all the other things that Netscape did. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=383.92s)]
*  Everybody would think that that was great. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=388.92s)]
*  The deal is that you could be a successful business person and you get celebrated for [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=389.92s)]
*  your innovations or your business success. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=397.70000000000005s)]
*  You get celebrated for making lots of money. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  And then at the end, you give it all away and you are further celebrated for that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=403.88s)]
*  That washes away all of your sins. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=409.48s)]
*  You know, the idea sort of is you will thank us. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=412.4s)]
*  You get invited to all the great parties. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=414.96s)]
*  You get invited to Davos. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=416.79999999999995s)]
*  You get invited to Aspen. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=417.88s)]
*  You get to come in and sit with the New York Times editorial board. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  And you will mostly leave us alone and let us innovate. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  And that's the arc. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  And it's all great and wonderful. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=427.71999999999997s)]
*  This is kind of the philosophy that his whole career has operated by. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=432.41999999999996s)]
*  He found success at a really young age. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=439.56s)]
*  He was the co-founder of this iconic early Internet company called Netscape. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=442.12s)]
*  He made a lot of money and went on to be a very successful venture capital investor after [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=447.56s)]
*  that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=453.32s)]
*  He was thinking like, this is great. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=454.32s)]
*  I'm doing great things for the world and the world is going to thank me for it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=455.76s)]
*  His political views kind of reflected that as well. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=460.24s)]
*  He was a big fan of Obama. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=463.52s)]
*  He even wrote an op-ed about his choice to support him. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=465.32s)]
*  Part of it was that he personally liked Obama. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=469.44s)]
*  He called him smart, normal, curious, not radical, post-boomer. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=471.76s)]
*  He was a fan. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=477.84s)]
*  But, you know, in his view, the deal kind of started to break down toward the end of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=478.84s)]
*  the Obama years. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=484.64s)]
*  There's no doubt the sharing economy is disrupting traditional businesses. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=485.64s)]
*  A little context that's kind of helpful for understanding this. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=489.68s)]
*  In the middle of the 2010s, tech as an industry was going from this kind of quirky niche thing [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=493.28s)]
*  that was happening to an extremely powerful and bigger than ever part of our lives and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=499.47999999999996s)]
*  our economy. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=504.55999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's just hard to compete with the ease of online shopping. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=505.55999999999995s)]
*  I don't even have to leave my cubicle to find great deals all over the Internet. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  It is a much different experience than actually going to a store. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  Amazon is disrupting retail. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=515.36s)]
*  Let's look at Airbnb for one. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=517.24s)]
*  Startups are disrupting taxis and hotels. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=519.72s)]
*  Taxi drivers angry and frustrated that Uber and Lyft drivers are taking their business [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=522.48s)]
*  while escaping the expensive regulations taxis face. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  There are these major changes happening and the tech industry is kind of ascendant. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=532.6800000000001s)]
*  But when that happens, you know, it brings a lot of criticism too. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=536.9200000000001s)]
*  More and more these large companies and their power is a threat to democracy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=540.6s)]
*  And the tech industry was not used to being criticized about privacy, about labor practices. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  They really didn't like it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=551.88s)]
*  And so one moment that really encapsulates that for him is something that happened in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=553.0s)]
*  2015 with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, when they announced that they were going [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=559.0s)]
*  to donate most of their net worth to charity. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=565.32s)]
*  So they did this thing where they announced and committed that 99% of their ownership [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=568.08s)]
*  in Facebook was going to go to philanthropic causes. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=571.32s)]
*  This is, you know, following the classic deal trajectory, right? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=574.84s)]
*  And they just got hammered with criticism and attacks on that. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=579.44s)]
*  But instead of getting the praise and adoration that they expected, they actually got a lot [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=583.08s)]
*  of criticism for the structure that they chose to give the money away in, the way that they [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=588.1600000000001s)]
*  were doing it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  People were kind of picking it apart. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=594.5200000000001s)]
*  And the line of argument was literally, oh, they're just slimy rich people and they're [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=595.6s)]
*  only doing it for the tax break, which is like a basic mathematical problem, which is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=598.5200000000001s)]
*  you don't give away 99% of your money for a tax break. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=604.1600000000001s)]
*  To Andreessen and his telling, this really kind of encapsulated for him the beginning [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=607.52s)]
*  of his shift in perspective on basically everything. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=612.92s)]
*  Basically, what I experienced was they, the people in charge of all this, basically broke [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=618.3199999999999s)]
*  the deal. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=626.8s)]
*  So basically every single thing I just said is, you know, for the last decade has been [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=628.0799999999999s)]
*  now held to be presumptively evil. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=631.36s)]
*  Black people are held to be this evil class. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=634.72s)]
*  Anybody who's rich is evil. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=636.76s)]
*  Philanthropy was being redefined as evil. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like, okay, every single part of that deal no longer works. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=641.1600000000001s)]
*  And so it just, you know, for me, it then raised the question of like, okay, if none [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=643.48s)]
*  of that is true, then what world am I living in? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=646.0s)]
*  What role do I play? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=647.9200000000001s)]
*  So in his mind, the deal had been honored for much of the history of Silicon Valley [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=652.9200000000001s)]
*  own very successful career until suddenly people start to, as you said, pick apart, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=659.64s)]
*  question, challenge everything about the people who are at the center of the deal, these entrepreneurs, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  these founders, people like Mark Zuckerberg, and suddenly they can only do wrong. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=674.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=680.36s)]
*  He has kind of described this as a little bit of a journey of him asking himself, like, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=681.68s)]
*  what's happening here? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=688.88s)]
*  And that was really compounded by the election of Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=690.2399999999999s)]
*  He talked about how it really took him by surprise. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=695.4s)]
*  And he realized he didn't understand what was happening in the country. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=698.4s)]
*  And he needed to go on his own kind of political awakening and figure out what was driving [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=701.12s)]
*  this. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=707.76s)]
*  And what does that awakening look like? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=708.84s)]
*  And what does he find? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=711.04s)]
*  Well, you know, after the 2016 election, the tech companies came under a lot of scrutiny [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=712.04s)]
*  from both sides. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=718.2s)]
*  And so kind of while he's doing this inquiry, he's trying to kind of learn about what's [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=719.84s)]
*  actually going on in America. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=723.72s)]
*  We have these allegations made by US intelligence that Russia had basically hijacked platforms [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=725.76s)]
*  like Facebook and use them to meddle in the US election. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=733.12s)]
*  So Andreessen has a front row seat to this. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=737.04s)]
*  He's on Facebook's board. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=739.44s)]
*  I went to Hillary's first post-election loss speech, which she gave at Stanford. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=741.04s)]
*  And the Russiagate stuff is in full, full-blown display. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=745.52s)]
*  And Hillary gets up there and she says, Trump is only president today because Vladimir Putin [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=749.64s)]
*  hacked Facebook and made him the president. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=752.84s)]
*  And I'm sitting in the audience and I'm on the Facebook board and I'm like, that's not [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=755.84s)]
*  true. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=758.68s)]
*  I know for an absolute fact that that's not true. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=759.68s)]
*  He felt like it didn't add up and that people were just scapegoating the tech companies. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=765.72s)]
*  And so that got me thinking. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=770.0400000000001s)]
*  And then the Russiagate stuff unspooled. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=771.44s)]
*  And I was like, it was just this litany of, you know, basically excuses and complaints, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=772.96s)]
*  right, with no sense of like personal responsibility at all. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=776.6s)]
*  Ultimately, you know, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia did interfere by using [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=780.7600000000001s)]
*  social media platforms. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=786.36s)]
*  And Facebook set up an oversight board to start monitoring this stuff. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=788.1600000000001s)]
*  And they're trying to run a business. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=792.2s)]
*  They're trying to get to the next quarter. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=793.2s)]
*  They're trying to get the employee base and everybody copacetic. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=794.76s)]
*  They're trying not to get just completely destroyed by the politicians. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=797.8s)]
*  Andreessen is still a little bit concerned about the direction that things are going. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=800.96s)]
*  He views it as a slippery slope that, you know, tracking things like hate speech, moderating [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=804.92s)]
*  things is a road to censorship. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=811.4s)]
*  And so he kind of concludes that the oversight is going a little bit too far. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=814.28s)]
*  And then Joe Biden gets elected, which in his mind accelerates all the problems that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=818.6s)]
*  he saw already unfolding in the tech industry. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=823.28s)]
*  How so? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=826.6s)]
*  Well, especially during the pandemic, the Biden administration put a lot of pressure [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=827.6s)]
*  on Facebook to suppress things like the lab leak theory of how COVID started. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=831.12s)]
*  At one point, Biden accused the social media platforms of killing people by allowing disinformation [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=837.12s)]
*  on the vaccines to flourish. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=843.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  And I remember Facebook in particular took that very personally and they were upset about [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=850.48s)]
*  And just to add a little bit of context, Democrats have historically had a very tight relationship [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=851.76s)]
*  with the tech industry and Joe Biden did not. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=857.28s)]
*  And among the first things that Biden does is he appoints two people that the tech industry [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=861.08s)]
*  really does not like to key regulatory roles. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=865.72s)]
*  That's Lena Kahn as the head of FTC, Gary Gensler at the SEC. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=869.36s)]
*  And they're going after big tech for antitrust. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=874.76s)]
*  That hurts mergers and acquisitions and the ability of some of Andreessen's portfolio [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=878.86s)]
*  companies to get bought. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=883.86s)]
*  Gary Gensler is going after the crypto industry and that hurts a lot of the companies that [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=886.62s)]
*  Andreessen Horowitz has invested in. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=891.8000000000001s)]
*  They're one of the biggest crypto investors. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=894.38s)]
*  And so the Biden administration really takes this kind of antagonistic view toward tech. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=896.38s)]
*  And a lot of people in the tech industry bristled at that. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=902.82s)]
*  So at first, he's watching with some alarm as tech companies, primarily from the left, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=906.2s)]
*  are being pushed toward a form of what he regards as censorship. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=911.48s)]
*  And then he's watching as a new administration comes in that, based on its appointments, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=916.46s)]
*  seems outright hostile to big tech's business interests. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=921.8000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=927.1600000000001s)]
*  And this all sort of culminates in this meeting that happened last May. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=928.32s)]
*  Andreessen and a lot of other tech people met with Biden's people to talk about AI. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=934.6s)]
*  And he basically comes away with the view that the Democrats are not just trying to [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=940.44s)]
*  control speech, but they're trying to control Silicon Valley. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=945.66s)]
*  They're trying to control technology. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=948.72s)]
*  We had meetings in DC in May where we talked to them about this and the meetings were absolutely [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=950.72s)]
*  horrifying. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=956.28s)]
*  According to Andreessen, Biden's people basically came in and took a very antagonistic view [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=957.48s)]
*  of AI and how to regulate it. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=965.3199999999999s)]
*  They said, look, AI is a technology basically that the government is going to completely [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=968.48s)]
*  control. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=971.0s)]
*  This is not going to be a startup thing. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=972.74s)]
*  They basically said AI is going to be a game of two or three big companies working closely [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=974.16s)]
*  with the government. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=978.3s)]
*  They essentially said AI is going to be controlled by the government. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=979.3s)]
*  Don't fund AI startups. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=982.56s)]
*  This is his characterization. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=984.5s)]
*  Other people who were there, including Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, disputes that characterization, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=986.56s)]
*  says maybe it's a little exaggerated. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=993.8399999999999s)]
*  And then I said, I don't understand how you're going to lock this down so much because like [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=995.9s)]
*  the math for AI is like out there and it's being taught everywhere. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=998.9s)]
*  The overall takeaway from Andreessen was that this is going to be a hostile fight between [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1002.7199999999999s)]
*  government regulators who want to clamp down on the technology that he and the companies [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1010.5999999999999s)]
*  that he invests in want to build. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1015.36s)]
*  You have this like incredibly radicalized set of policies with this young staff that [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1017.7600000000001s)]
*  just is like out for blood on all these different fronts. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1022.44s)]
*  And so this is when he basically concludes that Biden is anti-tech. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1031.3600000000001s)]
*  He views the administration and by extension Democrats as radical on tech innovation and [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1039.84s)]
*  tech progress, which is kind of his life's work. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1047.3999999999999s)]
*  So all of this together really primes him to be courted by the other side. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1051.12s)]
*  When you leave a meeting like that, what do you do? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1059.24s)]
*  You go and burst Donald Trump. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1063.92s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1069.28s)]
*  Aaron, talk about this courtship from the other side, because so far what you're describing [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1084.52s)]
*  from Marc Andreessen is really a deepening frustration with the left, with the Biden [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1089.36s)]
*  administration rather than any kind of deep kinship with Donald Trump. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1095.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1100.48s)]
*  And on July 5th, he posted this manifesto, which is something that he does from time [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1101.48s)]
*  to time. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1109.0s)]
*  He's got some really famous ones, including software is eating the world and it's time [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1110.0s)]
*  to build. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1112.96s)]
*  He posts one that is called the little tech agenda. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1114.24s)]
*  He basically concludes that big tech companies have lobbyists that are kind of looking out [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1117.5600000000002s)]
*  for them, but no one's sticking up for what he calls little tech. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1122.56s)]
*  And that includes all the startups and the venture firms that he's working with. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1126.72s)]
*  And he basically says, Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm is going to support [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1131.24s)]
*  any candidate that supports the little tech agenda. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1136.56s)]
*  And so that's kind of like opening the door for like, hey, you know, any presidential [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1140.44s)]
*  candidate, any congressional candidate that wants to, you know, kind of win our vote and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1145.04s)]
*  our support. Like, tell us what you got. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1150.6599999999999s)]
*  And they tried to meet with both Biden and Trump. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1153.4199999999998s)]
*  They never ended up meeting with Biden, but Trump invited them to dinner. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1156.34s)]
*  So we met with him at his Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey, which is like breathtaking, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1163.34s)]
*  absolutely beautiful. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1167.22s)]
*  Mark Andreessen and his partner, Ben Horowitz, end up at Trump's golf club in New Jersey, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1168.8999999999999s)]
*  Bedminster. Yeah, I mean, he's just he's an incredible host. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1174.82s)]
*  You know, he runs his own private worlds. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1177.34s)]
*  And they're super impressed by Trump. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1179.82s)]
*  So what do you guys want to eat? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1182.9s)]
*  And I just for some reason, I was just like, I know exactly what to say. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1183.94s)]
*  And I'm like, meat, I want meat. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1186.38s)]
*  It was glorious. Andreessen talks about how Trump only ordered meat and how he wine and [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1188.54s)]
*  dine them. It's also one of the really interesting kind of watching him at work, which is [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1193.86s)]
*  he treats everybody the same and he talks to everybody. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1197.46s)]
*  He will happily talk to distinguished visitors about, like, you know, who the vice president [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1199.78s)]
*  should be and then he'll ask the caddy. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1203.18s)]
*  They talk about how Trump talks to everyone. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1204.78s)]
*  You know, he's really kind of in the mix. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1208.0600000000002s)]
*  His thing with us basically was like, look, I just want America to win. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1210.94s)]
*  He's telling them kind of exactly what they want to hear. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1213.78s)]
*  You know, you guys are in tech. I don't know much about tech, but I don't need to because [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1217.6200000000001s)]
*  you guys know a lot about it. You guys should go build tech companies. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1220.46s)]
*  The American tech companies should win. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1223.02s)]
*  He wants America to win and he wants tech to win. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1224.74s)]
*  We should beat China. We should export. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1227.94s)]
*  We should make the products the world wants. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1229.8200000000002s)]
*  Our economy should be growing a lot faster. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1231.8200000000002s)]
*  We should be creating a lot more jobs. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1233.78s)]
*  You know, everybody in America who wants a good job should have one. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1235.74s)]
*  And that will be the result of American companies succeeding. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1238.18s)]
*  He wants to do what he can to help tech companies thrive. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1241.5800000000002s)]
*  And he wants government to get out of the way. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1247.26s)]
*  And he wants American innovation to be exported all around the world. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1249.22s)]
*  And so, you know, and most of the discussion was just around that. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1253.9s)]
*  And so they were really taken with Trump and his message to them. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1256.22s)]
*  Right. It sounds like what he's telling Andreessen. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1260.8600000000001s)]
*  And it sounds like Andreessen wants to hear it is that Trump is prepared to [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1263.1s)]
*  restore the deal, as Andreessen would call it. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1267.7s)]
*  You do your thing. I'm here to cheer you on and celebrate and help. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1272.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1276.26s)]
*  So what ends up happening after this dinner at Bedminster? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1279.1s)]
*  Shortly after that, Andreessen and Horowitz post a podcast announcing that [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1283.5s)]
*  they are endorsing Trump for president. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1289.22s)]
*  They went into a lot of the stuff that we've been talking about, you know, the [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1292.74s)]
*  pressure to moderate content online, the regulation, the fact that Trump is eager [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1296.02s)]
*  to see the tech industry innovate and build and do all the things they want to [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1301.02s)]
*  do. And there was one other reason. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1304.78s)]
*  I think it's hard for any man to see somebody get shot in the head, bleeding, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1307.46s)]
*  not knowing how badly he's been injured. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1312.0600000000002s)]
*  They really talked about how impressed they were by the fact that he, you know, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1313.66s)]
*  raised his fist after the assassination attempt. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1318.42s)]
*  And put your fist up in the air and say, fight, fight, fight. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1321.5s)]
*  Like how cool they thought that was. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1323.94s)]
*  We don't see physical bravery like that. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1325.8200000000002s)]
*  Like all of these things combined result in their endorsement. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1327.78s)]
*  And that's really the start of when a lot of people who were maybe privately [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1331.66s)]
*  supporting Trump in Silicon Valley really started to come out of the woodwork and [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1336.3400000000001s)]
*  say so publicly. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1341.0600000000002s)]
*  So Andreessen creates something of a permission structure for others in the [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1342.5800000000002s)]
*  valley to say, I too support Trump. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1346.38s)]
*  Absolutely. Andreessen and Elon Musk and a few other leaders combined. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1349.98s)]
*  I mean, Elon's endorsement was obviously really influential, but within the tech [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1355.02s)]
*  industry, specifically venture capital and startups, you know, Marc Andreessen, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1359.94s)]
*  his opinion really carries a lot of weight. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1365.22s)]
*  And I think that did open the door for a lot of people to come out as Trump [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1367.26s)]
*  supporters as well. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1371.82s)]
*  In thinking about the story that you have told here and the journey that Marc [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1374.26s)]
*  Andreessen has gone on, it's pretty clear that there are two major elements here. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1376.94s)]
*  One is that in his mind, the Democratic Party failed him and failed tech, both [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1379.66s)]
*  culturally and financially. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1384.94s)]
*  And the second component is that Trump in his mind meets the tech industry where [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1387.5400000000002s)]
*  it is both culturally and financially. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1393.8600000000001s)]
*  And in that sense, it's just not all that complicated. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1396.3400000000001s)]
*  But what stands out to me at least is that this ends up being the story of the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1398.7s)]
*  Democratic Party seeming to forfeit what had been a very long and seemingly [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1405.9s)]
*  fruitful relationship with these innovators and leaders of tech. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1412.0600000000002s)]
*  And when we think about the result of the 2024 election, I think quite [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1417.8200000000002s)]
*  naturally, you know, we think about the fact that the vote went to Trump and [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1421.8600000000001s)]
*  that once again, he made all these gains in various constituencies. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1427.26s)]
*  I hadn't really thought of it as an election in which he had also made gains in [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1430.94s)]
*  the constituency of Silicon Valley, but that is clearly one of the places that he [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1436.42s)]
*  made very unexpected inroads. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1442.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1445.78s)]
*  And there is a little bit of, I think, maybe soul searching in Silicon Valley now [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  thinking about like which party some people belong to. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1453.1s)]
*  I mean, the frustration with the Biden administration wasn't just limited to [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1456.46s)]
*  people who were Trump curious or who have supported Trump. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1460.82s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people were frustrated with the antitrust policies or with some [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1463.98s)]
*  of the crypto stuff that was happening. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1469.38s)]
*  So yeah, there is a little bit of an opportunity, I think, for a reset in [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1472.1000000000001s)]
*  Silicon Valley, and we're seeing that happen just as some of the loudest and [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1476.46s)]
*  most influential voices in tech who support Trump are really on this victory [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1480.94s)]
*  lap. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1485.86s)]
*  Well, now that we understand the depth of Silicon Valley support for Trump and now [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1486.86s)]
*  that Trump is about to take office, how much sway do we think people like Mark [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1490.9399999999998s)]
*  Andreessen, because they were out early and publicly for Trump, will have over [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1495.62s)]
*  him as president? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1500.3s)]
*  Because so far it feels like it's the tech industry in some of its policy [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1501.26s)]
*  announcements and its donations to Trump's inauguration that have been making [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1505.86s)]
*  the concessions to Trump rather than Trump necessarily making any concessions [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1510.3s)]
*  to Silicon Valley. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1513.78s)]
*  I mean, the tech industry right now is jockeying for a lot of influence in the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1516.82s)]
*  future Trump administration. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1521.26s)]
*  With Andreessen specifically, two Andreessen Horowitz partners have already [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1523.58s)]
*  been appointed to join the administration, and lots of tech workers are trying to [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1527.62s)]
*  get involved in DOGE, which is the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1531.4199999999998s)]
*  Its goal is to reduce government spending. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1535.02s)]
*  You see a new post on social media every day of some prominent tech person heading [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1537.2199999999998s)]
*  over to Mar-a-Lago to meet and try and get on one of these advisory boards or [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1541.6999999999998s)]
*  involved in the transition team. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1545.34s)]
*  There is a lot of crossover. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1547.34s)]
*  It kind of reminds me of the Obama administration a little bit when you had [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1549.5s)]
*  all these people from Apple, Airbnb, Facebook, kind of a rotating door in and [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1554.1s)]
*  out of that administration. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1559.1399999999999s)]
*  That's now happening in the Trump transition. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1560.62s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1563.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's been fascinating to see. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1563.34s)]
*  It's different people, obviously, from different sides of the aisle. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1565.3s)]
*  But yeah, there's a lot of enthusiasm among certain groups in the tech industry [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1569.54s)]
*  to seize this opportunity and potentially get to influence what they see [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1575.14s)]
*  as a whole new regulatory regime. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1581.94s)]
*  You know, it strikes me, Erin, that Andreessen's animating premise here, and [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1585.3400000000001s)]
*  really the heart of his political evolution, is his belief that this deal [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1590.7800000000002s)]
*  he articulated makes sense, still makes sense. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1596.42s)]
*  But the reality, I think, for many is that the deal he wants to bring back, the one [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1599.8200000000002s)]
*  he felt Biden walked away from, the one he thinks Trump will honor, was from a [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1604.58s)]
*  different era, right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1608.98s)]
*  When tech was small, it was the underdog. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1610.1799999999998s)]
*  You could argue it needed a long leash to grow and thrive. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1612.34s)]
*  But that's not the story of tech now. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1615.62s)]
*  It is huge and hugely powerful. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1617.34s)]
*  It affects all of us. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1620.06s)]
*  In many cases, for good, in many for bad. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1621.1s)]
*  Take kids' social media or the anti-competitive behavior of tech giants that's [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1623.86s)]
*  laid out in federal antitrust lawsuits, or take the risks of artificial [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1629.02s)]
*  intelligence or crypto. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1632.62s)]
*  We watch the biggest crypto exchange explode and billions of dollars just [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1633.98s)]
*  disappear. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  And therefore, many would argue, tech does require some kind of meaningful [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1638.78s)]
*  government oversight. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1644.7s)]
*  And so what he's asking for seems to be a world where the government's approach [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1646.18s)]
*  to tech, the deal, no longer really matches what tech is today. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1651.58s)]
*  And yet what he seems to want from Trump, and people like Andreessen seem to want [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1658.94s)]
*  from this administration, is a world where the terms of this deal don't change, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1662.98s)]
*  even though the industry quite obviously has. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1668.54s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1672.54s)]
*  The tech industry has amassed so much power and influence over the last 10, 20 [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1673.74s)]
*  years, and they love that power. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1678.82s)]
*  But there's a lot of accountability, responsibility that comes along with that. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1682.14s)]
*  And there's been some trust lost along the way. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1687.06s)]
*  So none of this regulatory stuff, none of this criticism has come out of nowhere. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1690.6999999999998s)]
*  There are plenty of people that believe that big tech power is stifling [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1696.1799999999998s)]
*  innovation. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1699.54s)]
*  That's why we need antitrust enforcement. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1700.1799999999998s)]
*  There's strong case to be made that a lot of these emerging technologies like AI [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1702.1799999999998s)]
*  and crypto can cause real harms, and that's why they need to be regulated. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1707.2199999999998s)]
*  But right now, that is not the vibe that is coursing around Silicon Valley. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1711.34s)]
*  The vibe is that this is a time to put our foot on the gas. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1717.62s)]
*  One thing that Andreessen said that really struck me, he had a quote that it felt like [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1723.22s)]
*  a boot off the throat for the tech industry the day that Trump was elected. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1727.06s)]
*  Wow, that's vivid. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1731.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1733.3s)]
*  And so that sentiment, while a little dramatic, is kind of shared amongst the Trump [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1733.94s)]
*  supporting techies. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1738.94s)]
*  You know, just to be clear, like nothing has happened yet, and Trump is [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1740.06s)]
*  unpredictable. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1742.58s)]
*  So who knows how this is actually going to shake out. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1743.3s)]
*  But that's the sentiment in this world that for years they supported Democrats and [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1746.9s)]
*  what they got in return was criticism and attacks. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1751.74s)]
*  That's the view. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1754.8200000000002s)]
*  They were vilified. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1755.38s)]
*  And regulated. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1756.8200000000002s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1757.9s)]
*  And now they feel like they're going to get what they want, which is a lack of [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1758.98s)]
*  regulation, a lack of criticism, and in their minds, free rein to innovate at [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1762.7800000000002s)]
*  will. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1768.22s)]
*  Well, Erin, thank you very much. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1768.5s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1777.54s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1778.62s)]
*  On Friday, Silicon Valley's alienation from Biden and growing fondness for Trump [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1782.7s)]
*  continued to be on vivid display. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1788.9s)]
*  At a news conference, Biden denounced the decision by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to end [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1792.18s)]
*  the company's system of fact checking, calling it, quote, really shameful. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1797.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, Zuckerberg traveled to Mar-a-Lago for his second in-person meeting with Trump [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1804.14s)]
*  since the election. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1811.42s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1814.7s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1822.78s)]
*  Over the weekend, the death toll from the wildfires across greater Los Angeles reached [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1825.9s)]
*  24 people with many more still missing. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1831.3799999999999s)]
*  As winds briefly calmed, firefighters made some progress in fighting two of the biggest [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1835.58s)]
*  fires. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1841.94s)]
*  As of Sunday night, they have contained 11 percent of the Palisades fire and 27 percent [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1842.94s)]
*  of the Eaton fire. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1849.62s)]
*  But forecasters expect another round of strong winds to return today and tomorrow, which [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1851.46s)]
*  may only intensify and spread the fires and force the planes that are fighting them from [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1858.58s)]
*  the sky to be grounded. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZKS8sF8_Ic&t=1864.94s)]
