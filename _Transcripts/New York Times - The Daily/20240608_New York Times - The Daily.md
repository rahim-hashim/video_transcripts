# 'The Interview': The Darker Side of Julia Louis-Dreyfus
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXrMU4JCGHU)
*  From the New York Times, this is the interview.
*  I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro.
*  At some point in almost every performance she gives, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has this look.
*  If you've watched Seinfeld, the New Adventures of Old Christine or Veep, you definitely know
*  it.
*  It's that perfect mix of irritation and defiance.
*  Like she's saying, try me.
*  That spikiness has always felt revelatory to me, especially three decades ago, when
*  Julia was first putting these kinds of women on our screens.
*  In recent years, she's been moving in new, more introspective directions, but still pushing
*  against conventional wisdom about women.
*  That's especially true on her wonderful hit podcast, Wiser Than Me, where she interviews
*  older female celebrities.
*  She's also doing more movies, including two independent films with the writer and director
*  Nicole Hallifsoner about the struggles of middle age.
*  And she's got a recurring role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
*  Her newest movie is called Tuesday.
*  It's directed by Dinah O. Pusich.
*  And in it, she plays a mother whose teenage daughter has a terminal illness.
*  It's a surreal, dark fairy tale.
*  One of the main characters is a CGI parrot who represents death.
*  And as she told me, she was nervous about taking it on.
*  Clearly, even in her 60s, Julia is not done challenging herself and those of us watching her.
*  Here's my conversation with Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
*  Hi, Lulu. How are you?
*  I'm great. How are you?
*  I'm good.
*  I have a lot of questions about the new movie, but it's a pretty heavy film.
*  So I just want to warm up a little with some other questions before we get into that.
*  Sure.
*  Am I right that you're in a new Marvel film at the moment?
*  It must be a very different kind of set to be on.
*  Yeah, it really is.
*  What's it like when you're actually on set?
*  Is it as sort of manic as it might seem?
*  No, it's not manic at all.
*  It's very well organized.
*  It's very methodical.
*  And I don't mean that in a negative way.
*  Particularly on this film, they're very much focused on, frankly, the human story, believe
*  it or not.
*  I think they're trying to sort of go back to their roots, as it were, for real.
*  And so there's a lot of focus on that.
*  They're trying to stay away from as much, I guess you call it CGI or whatever, as possible
*  so that the stunts are like everywhere.
*  And in fact, I had to do a couple, which I loved.
*  What stunts have you been doing and what's that been like?
*  Because you don't normally do movies with stunts.
*  Well, I've been in movies with stunts, but not in really once I've performed.
*  And this and by the way, I'm making this out to sound like I'm like flying through the
*  air like, you know, Captain America or whatever, but I'm not.
*  I'm so it's just a very, very, very, very brief stunt.
*  It's practically nothing.
*  So I don't want to. You're not doing a Tom Cruise like flying over a canyon.
*  No, I'm not on the motorcycle jumping off a cliff.
*  But even the little bit that I did do took a few days of rehearsal and it's gobs of fun.
*  In fact, the only thing I don't like is being away from home.
*  But other than that, it's really been a very happy experience.
*  I'm not kidding. It's wild to witness it.
*  For example, I just say one other quick thing on set.
*  Now, one of the two editors is on set and is doing a rough edit as we're shooting.
*  And the reason for this is so that it's ultimately if you have the budget to do that, you
*  have to have a certain budget to be able to do that.
*  But ultimately, I think it's a financial savings because then in the moment on the day,
*  they it's like putting pieces of a puzzle together to get these things right.
*  And if you realize you need that angle of this hand coming in from that direction, you
*  can get it on the day as opposed to trying to reshoot it or realizing in the edit room
*  six weeks later. So it's a wild amount of detail and attention.
*  Do you have complicated feelings about what the superhero franchises have done to
*  films in general?
*  Because you when you've chosen to do films lately, they've been sort of smaller films,
*  there have been more intimate films.
*  And then you have these massive franchises that have taken over in so many ways.
*  So I'm just wondering how you look at that.
*  I look at it gratefully.
*  I mean, I don't.
*  Look, there's no guarantee that just because a movie is in a franchise, it's going to
*  work. There's scores of examples of exactly that.
*  And even in the Marvel universe, they've had some clunkers.
*  So I'm not sure that the size of a franchise is the problem with the entertainment
*  business. I do believe that the corporations eating up corporations, eating up
*  corporations may be more of the problem, but not the franchise itself, if that makes
*  sense.
*  You mean the consolidation in the industry with less competition and therefore?
*  Yeah. And lots of cooks and lots of people with opinions.
*  And so the idea of a new idea or an independent idea or an outside the box idea is
*  harder to sell, to make, it seems.
*  Well, I guess that dovetails really nicely.
*  Let's talk about Tuesday, your new film, because that is exactly sort of the opposite.
*  It is a small film.
*  You play the mother of a terminally ill teenager.
*  But this is also a fantasy film in that death is portrayed by a talking parrot.
*  Why did you want to do this film?
*  Well, I read the script and I was immediately intrigued by it because it was so unusual.
*  And the themes of the film captivated my imagination.
*  And that is to say, loss and grief and motherhood and denial and death and dying.
*  All of that is interesting to me.
*  And I feel that this way of exploring these themes, using magical realism to tell the
*  story. I'm not going to lie.
*  I was nervous about it because it's very strange.
*  And I met Dinah a couple of times and we talked a great length because I wanted to really
*  get a sense of her and could I give my heart to her and trust her?
*  Because if this didn't work, if this really fell flat, if this bird that's in the movie,
*  who's played brilliantly by Arun say Kenya, if that doesn't work, we've got a real problem.
*  And so I needed to talk to her very seriously about her intention and her vision.
*  And I fell in love with her and the story and took this leap of faith, which it was.
*  Yeah. I mean, in preparation for this and after watching the film, we had a lot of
*  discussions about the parrot and how to describe the parrot and what the parrot is.
*  It's an unusual device in this movie.
*  And not to get sort of all college English seminar on you, but no, God, I won't be able
*  to answer. But how do you when you were coming to this and you were having these
*  discussions, what did you sort of see its meaning to be in the film?
*  I saw for me personally, and it doesn't mean this is for everyone because you can
*  interpret this any way you like.
*  But for me, he was my death doula.
*  He was my guide for me, my character.
*  That's a really great analogy because in the film, he leads you through these various
*  stages of dealing with the death of your daughter.
*  And I have to say, as a mother myself, it was pretty hard to watch.
*  Yeah. I mean, even talking about it as I can feel it, it's hard to even talk about.
*  Yeah. You said that you were interested in exploring these ideas.
*  Can you tell me why?
*  Sure. Well, they're fundamental.
*  It's funny how we're all going to die and everyone we know is going to die.
*  We're all going to die.
*  And yet we do not waste any time really thinking about that.
*  And I probably shouldn't use the word waste, but we don't think about it a lot.
*  And that's maybe it's a good thing, but it is amazing because we all have that in
*  common. And it's not something you go through life considering a lot.
*  I've lost people very close to me in my life, and those losses are hard to reconcile.
*  Still are. I've given birth to two children and I don't want to be misunderstood, but
*  there is something about giving birth and the awesomeness of that.
*  And then when my father died and I was with him when he died, I was in a very difficult
*  situation. And I was in a very difficult situation.
*  And when my father died and I was with him when he died, there is a similar thing, the
*  waiting. And I was struck by how similar that was in certain ways to waiting for a
*  baby to come. And it has a mystery to it that is undeniable, as does the birth of a
*  baby. I myself had cancer now many years ago, but even so, the idea of that sort of
*  coming to knock on your door was like alarming, shall we say, which is the understatement
*  of the century. But did it give you a different relationship with your own mortality?
*  I mean, you described it as something knocking on your door.
*  It did. Not that I thought I'm leaving, that I'm going to die from this then. I wouldn't
*  allow myself to think it, but it was right here chirping in my ear. And I don't have
*  a sense, an arrogant sense of my immortality anymore. I don't the way you do when you're
*  I don't feel like that anymore. I feel a little more present and I feel a little more grateful.
*  Yeah, I know from other cancer survivors that it can fundamentally change your idea of how
*  to live your life.
*  Totally. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  In a good way.
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I have so much to celebrate and I feel an enormous sense of gratitude.
*  In this film, you have this scene where you say to your daughter, I don't know who I am
*  without you, what the world is without you in it. And I have to say it's a devastating
*  line because I think any parent just knows how unimaginable it is to experience the loss
*  of a child. How did you, while you were making this film, experience that yourself? I mean,
*  what were you tapping into?
*  Stuff I didn't want to tap into. So I, you know, I don't want to sound too actory.
*  Please sound actory.
*  No, I don't like that. But I was on location, we shot this in London. So I was not with my family.
*  And those few days that we shot the pivotal scenes in the movie, I had to call home a lot. I really
*  was a tad unhinged. It was a hard place to go in my mind. And even though it's pretend,
*  and I recognize that, and I'm not in any way implying that it's not pretend, you do have to
*  flirt emotionally with stuff in a very real way to give authenticity to a performance.
*  And it was a hard thing to do. It was a hard thing to do. It was a hard thing to recover from
*  after. That's why I had to call home a lot. That was a hard time. Let's just put it that way. It was
*  hard. So I'm going to shift out of the movie just for a moment because it is painful, I think.
*  Wait, before you do, can I ask you a quick question? Of course. I love your name. Is your
*  real name Lulu or is that a nickname? So my real name is Lourdes because I'm Hispanic, Lourdes.
*  But I've always been Lulu since I was born. It's a very common nickname. I'm Cuban. And so I've
*  always been Lulu. And so that's who I am. Well, lucky you Lulu. I love it. Thank you.
*  One of the messages, of course, in the film is not only that death is necessary,
*  but that it can be beautiful, that it actually isn't something necessarily to be afraid of.
*  And I recently heard an episode of your podcast, Wiser Than Me, where you interviewed Patti Smith
*  and you talked about the different ways that you've processed the death of people in your
*  own life. Have the conversations you've been having on your podcast helped you process
*  the sort of many ways, the surprising ways in which people just deal with the hard things in
*  their life? Yeah, it's really one of the many impetuses to making this pot. If that, what is
*  the plural of impetus, but whatever. Empathie. It's one of the empathie. That sounds wrong.
*  Let's use it. To having these conversations on the podcast, because all of these women that I'm
*  talking to have really lived very full, long lives. And that, of course, means they've
*  experienced loss. And I'm really interested to talk to them about how they move beyond it,
*  or with it, or into it, or what they're, I mean, I'm just loving to have those conversations.
*  And I want to hear from these women who have experienced an enormous amount of life.
*  Yeah, I mean, I find what's comforting about them, and sometimes a little depressing, is that
*  how many of the same themes, right? Sexism, prejudice, self-doubt, they have experienced
*  themselves. And I'm wondering, what is your takeaway from hearing these women having gone
*  through so many of the things that we're still going through now? There's a sense, with most of
*  them, not everybody, but there's a sense of, okay, I'm done with that bullshit. I don't know if we
*  can swear on your podcast. You can swear. But anyway, I'm done with that. I'm done with self-doubt.
*  I'm done with shame. I'm done with feeling weird about being ambitious. You know, the list is long.
*  We all know what it is. I think, for me, the takeaway is, oh, we can be done with that sooner
*  than we thought. We don't have to take 60, 70 fucking years to come to that conclusion.
*  What have you applied? What are you done with? Well, I'm done with,
*  I'm working on being done with self-doubt. I'm working on being done with shame. And
*  I'm working really hard on finding joy. Finding joy.
*  I like the way you paused and really kind of thought about your wording, because you said,
*  thought about your wording, because you said, I'm done with, and then you said,
*  I'm working on being done with. Well, I haven't accomplished all of this yet. I mean, I'm still,
*  old habits die hard. And I have a stronger sense of strength now than I did when I was
*  30 or 25. But I feel like there's still room to grow.
*  I want to just note one more thing about your podcast, which is that your mom appears on the
*  podcast. And you've talked about going to therapy with her when you were 60 and she was 87. Okay,
*  talk me through why she agreed to this, because I've laid my differences with my mom, who's 85,
*  sort of aside. I figure she's that age and she isn't going to change. But maybe I'm thinking
*  about this wrong. I went to therapy with my mother because she said something to me.
*  It might've been my dad's birthday, my dad who had passed. And she was remembering that it was
*  his birthday. And she said something about, I'm sure you're thinking about your dad. And I know
*  there was stuff there that I wish we'd been able to deal with or talk about when you were younger,
*  because my parents were divorced. Wish we had had a chance to do that. And I said, oh, well,
*  mom, what's keeping us? Why don't we do it? And so off we went and we did it. And it was very,
*  very helpful. It's not like everything becomes perfect, but that's not possible under any
*  circumstances. But it was an opportunity to communicate in maybe a more honest way and in
*  a safe way that was helpful to both of us. And I have no regrets about it. So if you're thinking
*  about it with your mom, and if you think your mother would be into it, I encourage you to do it
*  because you might not have the opportunity in 10 years. And you might think, oh, if only.
*  Did it heal things, unresolved things? Did you see her differently after that?
*  Yes.
*  I know I'm asking you a lot of personal questions.
*  I assume you're going to charge me after this.
*  I am.
*  But it's because you've been very open on your podcast.
*  I know. Huge mistake.
*  Do you feel that?
*  Well, I know it's weird because I don't know. I've never done anything like this. I think
*  it sort of surprises me a little bit. I'm incredibly private, point of fact. I mean,
*  I really am. So it is sort of a strange thing. But I also don't think that I've,
*  I don't have any regrets about what I've shared on the podcast, but it is new territory for me. But
*  I don't know. It's also good. I think it engenders a way of thinking about
*  communication that might be good.
*  All right. Let's get out of the heavy stuff. I want to ask you about being funny.
*  So you've had these 10 pole roles, Seinfeld, the New Adventures of Old Christine Veep.
*  Would you do another long running TV series? Are you open to that now?
*  Yes, I am. I am.
*  What is it about that kind of episodic thing where you
*  really develop a character over years that you like?
*  God, it's so much fun. You know, if you get the right group of people together,
*  it's like holy water. It's so magnificent. It's like a team sport. It's team play.
*  And it just doesn't get better than that. It's a lot. It's a treadmill, though, I will say.
*  I mean, it is absolutely a treadmill. And it's an enormous amount of work to keep doing that and
*  keep up what is hopefully a level of excellence over a long period of time. So there are built in
*  challenges. So maybe a limited series might be a little more doable right now because to get locked
*  into an eight year run on something might be a little daunting. But people aren't doing that
*  anymore anyway. Everything is much shorter lived, it seems, entertainment wise.
*  Thinking about Seinfeld and just how things are made now, could Seinfeld be made now?
*  Probably not. I mean, what the hell's happening in network television anymore? I mean,
*  when Seinfeld was made, it was really unlike anything that was on at the time. It was a very
*  different style of comedy and style of storytelling and a different premise. It was just a bunch of
*  losers hanging out. I mean, it wasn't like a family or even a workplace comedy. I'm not suggesting
*  the other is bad. I'm just saying it was very different. So I would say one main reason it
*  wouldn't be made now is because it's hard to get anything different recognized. And particularly
*  nowadays, everyone's sort of running scared, it seems. Although I will say, actually, I say this,
*  and then I will also say that at A24 where this movie was made, they are not scared of different.
*  Are you worried about where Hollywood's at right now?
*  Little bit. I am a little bit. I hope, I mean, people need to be entertained. People like to be
*  entertained. So it's not like I feel it's not going to disappear, but it's going through a
*  transition. I don't know how it's going to end up. So one of the things that I was thinking,
*  though, when I was looking at your characters on these long running series, Selena Meyer on V,
*  Belaine on Seinfeld, even Zora, the character on Tuesday, they're often not very likable people.
*  Is it fun to play people that act in unsympathetic ways?
*  It is. I love that. Why? Because it's so interesting. I don't know. I like an anti-hero.
*  And also, isn't that what people... Nothing is pure. Nobody's pure. Everyone makes horrible
*  mistakes and fails. And I think that's more interesting. And I think conflict is more
*  interesting. And I think it's funnier. When you say it's funnier, obviously conflict
*  is a great source of comedy. But I guess what I'm asking you is that, is there an
*  unlikable part of you that you bring? And I'm just wondering if... I can't believe I just asked you
*  that. Yeah. Wouldn't it be funny if as you said that, horns came up out of my head and my tongue
*  rolled out and it was like a spiked tongue? Am I... Yes, I am unlikable. Not that you're
*  unlikable. I think you're lovely. What I'm saying is, for example, I think that... And I am quite
*  proud of this. I'm a pretty prickly person. So I guess that's what I'm asking. Is it because maybe
*  you think you're too nice in real life that you've drawn to these characters? Or maybe that's part of
*  you too, that you're a sort of maybe difficult person and you are drawn to them because that
*  kind of exemplifies something about yourself? Well, I don't think I'm a difficult person.
*  I wonder what other people would say. I am an opinionated person and I have strong opinions
*  and strong instincts. And I think you're awful, Lulu.
*  Thank you, Julia. You're a prickly bitch is what you are. No, but anyway, I really do...
*  I am not like these people I play, but I am interested, I guess, in some aspect of myself
*  that like, for example, with Selena Meyer, she was essentially two years old and thought that the
*  world revolved around her and any mistakes she made was simply not her own. It was somebody else's.
*  And that's a fun ego thing to tap into, to not consider anyone else around you other than
*  yourself. And what does that mean? What does that mean when somebody does that? It means they,
*  obviously, they haven't been well nurtured. That goes without saying. But it's also an incredibly
*  funny place to start with a character. You know, talking about Veep, it does
*  make me wonder about how hard it is nowadays to be funny about politics. And you are very political.
*  You even hosted the DNC in 2020. One of the things that people say that they like about Trump is that
*  he's funny. And maybe they mean that he's entertaining in a shocking, irreverent way.
*  I'm looking at your face. You clearly don't think that he's funny. No. But one thing that
*  people do say on the other side about the Democratic Party is that it's become too puritanical.
*  Your former co-star Jerry Seinfeld recently made news for talking about political correctness in
*  comedy. And so I'm just wondering, as a famous comedian yourself, what you think about that.
*  I think that if you look back on comedy and drama both, let's say, 30 years ago,
*  through the lens of today, you might find bits and pieces that don't age well.
*  And I think to have antenna about sensitivities is not a bad thing. And it doesn't mean that
*  all comedy goes out the window as a result. When I hear people starting to complain about political
*  correctness, and I understand why people might push back on it, but to me that's a red flag,
*  because sometimes it means something else. I believe being aware of certain sensitivities
*  is not a bad thing. I don't know how else to say it.
*  Are there things that no longer feel funny to you that once did,
*  or things that are funny now that you didn't notice before?
*  Uh, oh, that's a good question. We're going to have to revisit that question,
*  because I don't know quite how to answer it.
*  Well, we are going to speak again.
*  You know, in our next session, doctor, we'll discuss it then, because I'm not sure. I have
*  to think about that. I want to be thoughtful about it.
*  After the break, I called Julia back to get her answer to that last question.
*  And we also talk about taking big swings in comedy.
*  There's enormous risk. Look, you're going to fail. You're going to fail.
*  And in order to be very funny, you have to take huge risks.
*  And sometimes those risks really pay off. And sometimes they truly do not.
*  And
*  Hi, this is Lulu. Well, hello, Lulu.
*  Where are you? What are you doing? I'm in Georgia right now. I'm shooting the Marvel movie here.
*  We talked about the Marvel movie. So you're actually down there doing your thing.
*  I am indeed. Yeah.
*  So I was wondering if you'd been thinking about anything from our previous conversation.
*  Yeah, I wanted to make sure that I answered this whole idea of political correctness correctly.
*  And I can't really remember what I just said. So I sort of wanted to go back to that and be
*  sort of very clear about where I stand. My feeling about all of it is, is that political
*  correctness, I mean, insofar as it equates to tolerance is obviously fantastic.
*  And of course, I reserve the right to boo anyone who says anything that offends me while also,
*  you know, respecting their right to free speech, right? But the bigger problem and the,
*  I think the true threat to art and the creation of art is the consolidation of money
*  and power and all this sidling of studios and outlets and streamers and distributors.
*  I don't think it's good for the creative voice. So that's what I want to say in terms of
*  the threat to art.
*  Yeah, I mean, I was also thinking more about what you said and having brought up Jerry Seinfeld and
*  his comments about comedy. And my intention wasn't to put you on the spot, but more to understand
*  how you think about risk taking and comedy. There's enormous risk. Look, you're going to fail.
*  You're going to fail. In order to be very funny, you have to take huge risks.
*  And sometimes those risks really pay off. And sometimes they truly do not.
*  And you have failed miserably. But that's the joy and the tragedy of doing anything funny.
*  You said though that last time it wasn't a bad thing to have sensitivity in comedy. Do you think
*  it makes comedy better that people are now more tuned to how some of their comments might be
*  received? I don't know. I can't judge that if it's better or not. I just know that the lens
*  through which we create art today, and I'm not going to just specify it to comedy. I think it's
*  also drama. It's a different lens. It really is. And I think even classically wonderful,
*  indisputably great films from the past are riddled with attitudes that today would not be
*  acceptable. So I think it's just good to be vigilant. Even I was thinking about this,
*  I thought, well, I mean, pretend this show, your show, the interview was being made 40 years ago.
*  I would posit that diversity would not be something you would be considering in terms of
*  the guests that you would bring to the show. Okay? So that's interesting, isn't it? I mean,
*  things have shifted. And in that case, I would say things have shifted very much for the good.
*  And also actually, Lulu, probably you wouldn't be the host.
*  I think Julia, you're probably right.
*  So I think we have to sort of keep working to make it better, warts and all.
*  So what I was thinking about our previous conversation was a moment where I asked you
*  about unlikability. And I was thinking that I used the wrong word. What I was trying to get at
*  was how I've always admired, and this is the word that I would use now, the sharp edges that you
*  bring to your characters. Does that description ring a little bit more true to you?
*  Yeah, I don't play good girls. I don't play girls that behave a way that a good girl should behave.
*  Or if they do, they do it with bitterness and anxiety. So I've played a lot of characters
*  who push back on the position that they're in, that are not content with their place in the world.
*  And I would say that women are having their rights taken away. And women are not content.
*  And I play women like that.
*  Do you think you're still trying to prove yourself?
*  Always, yeah.
*  Really?
*  Oh yeah. Like on Tuesday in this movie coming out, I'm certain nobody would have considered me for
*  that role 20 years ago or something. And that's probably because they just thought of me only as
*  a ha-ha funny person.
*  We left our last call on a question you wanted to think some more about. So have you had any
*  thoughts about how your sense of humor has changed or not over the years?
*  Oh, sorry, I forgot to think about it.
*  I didn't do my homework. Oh my God, Lulu. I'm so sorry. Please, please let me pass.
*  I don't know. I think my working sense of humor, that is to say what I bring to my performance,
*  I think that that's probably gotten better. I've been in the presence of so many people from whom
*  through osmosis and watching them work, I have learned things about physical comedy, about
*  the nuance of comedy, about the smallness of comedy. But there's always room to learn more.
*  And for me, that is an incredibly joyful adventure. That's my like last minute
*  procrastinating cliff notey answer.
