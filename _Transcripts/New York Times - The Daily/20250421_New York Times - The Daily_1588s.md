# Is the Era of Student Loan Forgiveness Officially Over?
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=4.18s)]
*  Across the country, millions of Americans with unpaid student loans are discovering [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=11.86s)]
*  that years of patience and forgiveness from the U.S. government have officially come to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=16.8s)]
*  an end. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=22.82s)]
*  Today, Stacey Cowley on what's behind the change of heart, its financial consequences [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=24.42s)]
*  for borrowers, and the larger reckoning that it could finally trigger about how Americans [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=30.82s)]
*  pay for higher education. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=37.08s)]
*  It's Monday, April 21st. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=45.82s)]
*  Well, Stacey, it's nice to have you back. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=48.82s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=55.34s)]
*  I think this is the third time that we have had a version of this conversation with you. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=56.34s)]
*  Fourth, I think. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=61.54s)]
*  Oh, excuse me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=62.54s)]
*  There's a lot of developments along the way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=63.54s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=64.54s)]
*  I mean, we keep coming to you to talk about this subject because you're the authority [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  on it and because it keeps changing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=69.06s)]
*  And at this point, it's genuinely confusing and it's extremely important to tens of millions [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  of people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=76.06s)]
*  I'm preemptively grateful. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=77.78s)]
*  Well, thank you for your interest. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=79.5s)]
*  So where exactly are we right now in this long winding saga of America's student loans? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=81.98s)]
*  So we're at a real turning point on this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=91.76s)]
*  After this nearly five-year period when most people weren't making payments and weren't [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=95.04s)]
*  required to do so and weren't having any negative consequences if they didn't, the government [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=98.94s)]
*  really dropped the hammer in the last few months. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=103.30000000000001s)]
*  They've said, we are done with timeouts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=105.58s)]
*  We're done with pauses. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=107.38s)]
*  You need to start paying again. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=108.7s)]
*  That's a very big change. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  And they instructed their loan servicers to start reporting delinquencies to the credit [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=112.42s)]
*  bureaus again, which hasn't happened for five years now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=116.06s)]
*  So that immediately resulted in four million people found delinquencies reported on their [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=119.62s)]
*  credit reports. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=125.38s)]
*  And these are serious delinquencies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=126.38s)]
*  People saw their credit scores plunge. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=127.62s)]
*  That can have immediate impacts on your ability to rent an apartment, to get a mortgage, to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=129.22s)]
*  get a loan for a car. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=133.5s)]
*  So this can be pretty catastrophic when this happens to you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=136.02s)]
*  And we've had four million people who are now in that delinquency. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=140.1s)]
*  The estimates are that we're going to have as many as nine million by the end of this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=143.9s)]
*  year and that many of those people could end up in default. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=146.94s)]
*  That's what happens when you don't pay for at least nine months. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=150.68s)]
*  And that sets off a whole nother series of very bad financial consequences. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=153.58s)]
*  And if we do end up with nine million people defaulting, that would be a record number. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=157.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=162.22s)]
*  So you also mean we have nine million Americans who are basically in the worst kind of financial [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=163.94s)]
*  bind you can be in. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=168.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=169.78s)]
*  And even beyond that, the repayment really hasn't gone as planned. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=170.78s)]
*  Right now, of the roughly 38 million borrowers who have payments too and are supposed to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=175.98s)]
*  be making payments. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=181.26s)]
*  Such a staggering number. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=182.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's a big number. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=183.26s)]
*  So of those 38 million, right now only about a third are making payments. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=184.26s)]
*  I think it's important to have you remind us briefly how we got here, because a lot [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=188.9s)]
*  of factors went into how we arrived in this moment. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=199.02s)]
*  So this federal student loan payment system has always been kind of rocky. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=200.02s)]
*  It has never really worked particularly smoothly for the last decade and a half. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=203.62s)]
*  But what happened when the pandemic started back in March 2020 was the government immediately [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=207.62s)]
*  called an emergency timeout in response to kind of the economic conditions at the time. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=212.34s)]
*  They said, all right, we're going to take this burden away from people. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=217.34s)]
*  You don't have to make these payments. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=219.88000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=221.34s)]
*  Huge deal and kind of understandable because it was the federal government that shut our [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=222.34s)]
*  economy down. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=225.78s)]
*  And so the thinking was we're going to not force a lot of people who are out of work [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  or making a lot less than usual to have this burden on top of that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=233.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=237.46s)]
*  There were record unemployment numbers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=238.46s)]
*  And one thing about this is not only was the government the one that shut things down, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=240.58s)]
*  they are also the creditor for all of these student loans. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=244.94s)]
*  It was a very unusual market and that they don't have to go to banks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=247.18s)]
*  They don't have to go to private lenders. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=249.82s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=250.82s)]
*  They were providing the loans. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=251.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=252.82s)]
*  So it was very easy for them to say, OK, we're just going to turn it off. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=253.82s)]
*  And that was always intended to be a temporary measure, but it kept getting extended. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=256.02s)]
*  First by President Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=260.26s)]
*  So Trump extended it several times. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=262.26s)]
*  Then President Biden took office and he extended it several times. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=264.3s)]
*  And it just kept going and going and going. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=268.26s)]
*  And so for how long were I think tens of millions, right, of folks who had lots of student loan [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=269.78000000000003s)]
*  debt permitted to not make repayments? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=276.54s)]
*  So it officially stretched for about four years until September 2023. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=280.3s)]
*  But then President Biden added an additional thing to this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=285.18s)]
*  He said, for the next year, all right, you're supposed to be making payments. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=287.82s)]
*  We're going to try to collect, but we're not going to report you to the credit bureaus [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=291.86s)]
*  if you don't. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=295.1s)]
*  I'm going to guess a lot of people took advantage of that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=296.1s)]
*  There wasn't a lot of negative consequences if you just didn't start paying. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=297.98s)]
*  So a lot of people didn't. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=301.3s)]
*  And adding to that was the confusion around what was going to happen to this debt. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=303.26s)]
*  I mean, President Biden was pursuing the plan of mass debt cancellation, up to 20,000 per borrower. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=306.86s)]
*  The Supreme Court then overturned that and all of these people who thought their debts [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=312.46s)]
*  might go away entirely got that disappointment. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=315.98s)]
*  And then President Biden moved on to his plan B, which was introducing a new repayment plan [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=319.42s)]
*  called SAVE that was much more generous than any past payment plan. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=324.34000000000003s)]
*  How much more generous? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=328.7s)]
*  Well, it was an income driven payment plan, meaning that your payments would be directly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=329.7s)]
*  tied to how much you were making. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=333.14s)]
*  It was deliberately an attempt to keep things affordable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=334.46s)]
*  And on past payment plans, that's typically been limited to about 10% of your discretionary [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=337.26s)]
*  income. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=341.74s)]
*  President Biden's plan cut that in half for people with only undergraduate loans. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=342.74s)]
*  So suddenly people whose payments were 10% of their income were cut down to 5%. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=346.4s)]
*  That's a huge change. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=351.53999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=352.53999999999996s)]
*  There's just a lot of amnesty kind of built into the messaging and the system. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=353.53999999999996s)]
*  But of course, Trump and his allies on the campaign trail, and I watched this closely, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=356.7s)]
*  were making the argument, wait a minute, why is student debt being treated with all this [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=361.9s)]
*  forgiveness? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=367.09999999999997s)]
*  Nothing like that happens to auto debt or mortgage debt. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=368.62s)]
*  So why college debt? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=371.94s)]
*  And to Trump, out of office at this point, it felt like a Democratic president handing [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=374.3s)]
*  out gifts to Democratic kind of people. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  There's a real political divide around here. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=382.53999999999996s)]
*  The reality of the demographics don't always bear it out. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=385.78s)]
*  A lot of the people who do have debt, it is a lot of people who are working class and [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=388.78s)]
*  a lot of people have amounts from things like trade schools and professional schools that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=394.3s)]
*  they haven't been able to pay off. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=398.08s)]
*  So plenty of people in the Trump coalition have student debt. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=399.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  But it was definitely clear that Trump had a very different vision for this than President [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=403.21999999999997s)]
*  Biden did. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=406.78s)]
*  And that if he were to come back to office, that a lot of what Biden had built was going [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=408.14s)]
*  to go away. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=412.06s)]
*  So let's fast forward to the part where Trump does come back to office. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=413.22s)]
*  What exactly does he do? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=416.58s)]
*  What does he change? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=419.3s)]
*  What does he take away? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=420.74s)]
*  And what remains? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=421.74s)]
*  So even before Trump comes back to power, the plan that Biden introduced, the save plan, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=423.66s)]
*  got caught up in court. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=429.3s)]
*  A group of Republican-led states challenged it, said to succeeded the president's authority, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=430.54s)]
*  and that has been prevailing in court, which left about 8 million borrowers who had signed [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=435.18s)]
*  up for this plan kind of in limbo, waiting to see what was going to happen with these [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=440.22s)]
*  court cases. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=444.18s)]
*  So once Trump returns to office, it becomes clear that the plan is doomed. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=445.54s)]
*  Save is doomed. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=449.82s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=450.82s)]
*  Either the courts are going to kill it or the president and his administration are going [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=451.82s)]
*  to kill it, but it's going to go away. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=454.5s)]
*  Which is pretty whipsaw-ish. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=456.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=457.9s)]
*  And those 8 million borrowers are all still just on pause right now. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=458.9s)]
*  But for all these other tens of millions of borrowers, the message is you need to be paying. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=463.26s)]
*  Biden had set it up so that payments were going to resume right after the election, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=468.58s)]
*  kind of no matter what happened. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=472.34s)]
*  That meant that Trump gets elected, he's coming into office just as this years of not really [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=474.1s)]
*  having to pay ends and as the government gets serious about collecting on these debts. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=480.46s)]
*  However, people have been warning for years that getting people to start paying again [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=486.34s)]
*  after years of not paying was going to be really tricky. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=490.94s)]
*  It was going to require a lot of resources and a lot of attention. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=493.94s)]
*  That is not what is happening. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=497.78s)]
*  The student loan servicers who are supposed to be collecting these debts are pretty hammered [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=499.61999999999995s)]
*  and overwhelmed and they have been struggling to get guidance from the education department. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=503.94s)]
*  Because Trump is trying to shut it down. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=510.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=513.02s)]
*  And one of the things borrowers are now confronting is not only do you have to start paying this [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=514.02s)]
*  bill again, but you also have to navigate what's the best way to pay it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=518.9s)]
*  And that's been one of the areas where borrowers have been running into challenges. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=524.08s)]
*  They have been trying to get themselves back into repayment and there is currently an enormous [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=527.4000000000001s)]
*  backlog at the education department. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  A lot of people have already left either by being fired or retiring or just deciding to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=534.08s)]
*  opt out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  So that agency is currently very hollowed out. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=540.5s)]
*  One of the offices that has really been decimated over there is an office that handles student [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=543.46s)]
*  loan borrower complaints. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=547.9200000000001s)]
*  One of the people who was fired last month from that office said in court filings that [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=549.58s)]
*  she left behind a backlog of 16,000 complaints. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=553.26s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=556.26s)]
*  That are piled up and unaddressed. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=557.62s)]
*  The education department also has more than a million borrowers who have applied for income [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=559.42s)]
*  driven payment and are stuck in limbo. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=564.34s)]
*  They're waiting for their applications to be processed. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=566.72s)]
*  There's a huge backlog often stretching for months. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=569.02s)]
*  So those people are also kind of stuck right now. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=571.96s)]
*  This is where the doge job cut rubber meets the road. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=574.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=579.3s)]
*  So exactly the moment when you would ideally want to be staffing up and putting more resources [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=580.3s)]
*  into the system to help people navigate this return to repayment, we've instead done the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=584.64s)]
*  opposite. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=588.8599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to assume that you have spoken to some borrowers who when they've been told [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=589.8599999999999s)]
*  now they have to start repaying are trying to do that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=594.3s)]
*  And I wonder what the math looks like in their financial life all of a sudden. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=598.8s)]
*  It's a real struggle for a lot of people. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=603.02s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me about this. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=605.38s)]
*  Oh, no problem. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=607.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=608.9399999999999s)]
*  I've been quite. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=609.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=610.94s)]
*  I spoke to a health care worker down in Florida who's been trying to get enrolled in the income [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=611.94s)]
*  driven repayment. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=618.36s)]
*  I do work two jobs because I'm kind of trying to prepare for that student loan payment. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=619.36s)]
*  She did the math on the government's own calculator and worked out that her payments would be [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=626.46s)]
*  about four hundred ninety dollars a month. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=630.5400000000001s)]
*  She said that would be a stretch, but she could make that work. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=632.9200000000001s)]
*  When I get a bill in January, that was for like nine hundred and twenty four dollars. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=635.86s)]
*  However, when she got her first bill, she found that something had gone awry and she [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=641.74s)]
*  was getting a bill for the standard payment amount. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=646.54s)]
*  And I'm like, this isn't right, because this is not what it should be. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=648.7s)]
*  Like, it should be much slower. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=651.7s)]
*  Which is not a bill she can deal with. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=654.54s)]
*  I mean, I make a decent income, but still it's never enough to keep up with that. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=656.02s)]
*  So she's been calling her servicer and spending hours and hours on hold multiple days for [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=662.34s)]
*  the last few weeks trying to get this fixed. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=667.5s)]
*  Yeah, their systems are all messed up. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=669.5400000000001s)]
*  You know what's actually going on behind the scenes? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=671.98s)]
*  It's almost like you're guessing what. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=674.46s)]
*  And it just keeps going awry at every turn. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=676.64s)]
*  She got a revised bill. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=678.46s)]
*  This one was for a thousand dollars. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=679.58s)]
*  She really has not been able to figure out what the problem here is. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=681.62s)]
*  And of course, the interest rate is ridiculous. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=684.22s)]
*  It's suffocating. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=687.62s)]
*  And that's a really frequent story. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=692.46s)]
*  I've talked to dozens of people trying to sort this out. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=693.94s)]
*  It's an albatross around my neck. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=696.7800000000001s)]
*  I want it off. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=698.38s)]
*  I literally lose sleep over this. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=699.38s)]
*  I have nightmares about this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=701.3000000000001s)]
*  My payments are so insanely high. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=702.86s)]
*  People got really used to not having that payment. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=705.7s)]
*  And now with this payment kind of crashing back into their lives, people are trying to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=708.38s)]
*  make it happen. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  They know it's a debt they borrowed and one that they have to repay. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=713.3000000000001s)]
*  And they're running into challenges. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=716.02s)]
*  So I called the Department of Education and waited on hold for hours. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=717.26s)]
*  Nobody has any answers. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=722.46s)]
*  Nobody has any solutions. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=723.66s)]
*  Trying to figure out how they can reintegrate this payment into their lives. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=726.26s)]
*  And I'm going, wait a second. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=729.9s)]
*  I can't make those payments. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=731.46s)]
*  That's a lot of money. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=733.5799999999999s)]
*  And then I'll never be able to retire. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=734.5799999999999s)]
*  That's why a big scary shadow chases me in my dreams, literally. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=738.18s)]
*  How should we think about the bind that a lot of these folks are in? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=747.5s)]
*  I mean, perhaps this is an imperfect analogy, you'll let me know. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=752.1s)]
*  But this feels a bit like the moment when a lot of folks in the mid-2000s who had those [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=756.3s)]
*  adjustable rate mortgages, like had them reset and all of a sudden they owed a lot more. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=763.18s)]
*  On some level, they knew that moment would come. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=768.98s)]
*  And yet when it comes, there's still a lot of financial sting. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=772.42s)]
*  Even as I'm asking the question, I'm recognizing why it's imperfect because in the case of [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  student loans, the situation kept changing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=780.12s)]
*  The rules kept changing. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=782.9599999999999s)]
*  The expectations kept changing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=784.04s)]
*  So maybe there's a flaw to that question. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=787.04s)]
*  How should we think about this? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=789.0s)]
*  There are very strange loans. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=790.0s)]
*  There is no other consumer loan that you take out where you don't know when you take it [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=791.04s)]
*  exactly what the payment terms and options are going to be. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=795.56s)]
*  That is really weird. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  And that has really whiplashed people. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=799.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, most of the borrowers I talk to start the conversation and end the conversation [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=800.56s)]
*  by saying, I want to pay what I owe. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=804.6s)]
*  I took the loan. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=806.76s)]
*  I knew what that was going to come to. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=807.76s)]
*  I knew I'm going to have to pay it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=809.2s)]
*  But they are really frustrated by both having this hope put in front of them for a more [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=811.0s)]
*  affordable option and then having it snatched away. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=816.28s)]
*  And they're also just really frustrated by the logistics right now of trying to figure [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=819.16s)]
*  out what am I supposed to be doing here? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=823.72s)]
*  What has become very evident from this conversation and all the previous conversations we've had [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=826.72s)]
*  with you is that student loans as managed by the federal government have become this [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=832.48s)]
*  really variable, wildly unpredictable thing that changes from one president to the next. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=839.6s)]
*  And that starts to make me wonder, and I'm guessing I'm not the only one, whether the [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=848.8800000000001s)]
*  federal government, with all the political whims of our system, is the right institution [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=855.8800000000001s)]
*  to be overseeing $1 trillion in student loans. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=861.88s)]
*  That's a question that gets asked frequently. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=867.2s)]
*  And certainly the situation right now is bringing it to light again. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=869.16s)]
*  And there are people in and around Trump, people in Trump's orbit, who are asking that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=875.92s)]
*  question and who are raising the issue of, is it time for the government's role in this [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=880.08s)]
*  to change? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=884.4s)]
*  Should the government really play a profoundly different kind of role in this system than [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=885.72s)]
*  it does now? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=889.36s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=910.4s)]
*  So, Stacey, if, as you just said, there's some real questions about whether the government [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=911.92s)]
*  should play this role in student loans, I think it naturally makes sense to understand [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  how and why the federal government got into this business in the first place. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=930.16s)]
*  What's that story? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  So for that, we go back to the mid-60s. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=936.92s)]
*  Up until then, college education and certainly financing for it was something that was pretty [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=940.16s)]
*  limited. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=945.12s)]
*  I mean, you really could only get that if you were a high-performing student studying [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=946.12s)]
*  hard sciences and things like that. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=950.16s)]
*  In 1965, Congress and the president passed the Higher Education Act, and that was a landmark [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=952.9599999999999s)]
*  bill that transformed the higher education system. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=958.8399999999999s)]
*  And it was the first time that said, we're going to have a government-sponsored program [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=962.1999999999999s)]
*  where pretty much anyone can come get a loan and borrow to go to college. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=967.36s)]
*  So private banks actually made the loans, but these are really risky loans. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=971.48s)]
*  A lot of them aren't going to get paid back. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=975.24s)]
*  So the role the government played was it said to the private lenders, okay, if this loan [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=977.82s)]
*  goes bad, if it sours and the borrower doesn't pay, we will step in and pay you. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=982.44s)]
*  Because there's a public interest in sending more and more Americans to college. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=988.0s)]
*  Yes, this was very much perceived as something that was good for the United States. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=992.88s)]
*  Part of it came out of a direct counter to the Soviet Union's, the concern that we would [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=997.04s)]
*  fall behind, that there would be an education gap. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1000.9599999999999s)]
*  So the idea was that this was something that was in the taxpayers' interests to make sure [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1003.6999999999999s)]
*  that more people could pursue higher education. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1008.04s)]
*  So how did that go, the government being the backstop? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1010.88s)]
*  Rocky. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1013.8s)]
*  The program went through a lot of changes over the years. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1014.8s)]
*  The banks were making money doing this, and the government was taking on the administrative [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1018.76s)]
*  burden of running the programs and of backstopping them. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1023.04s)]
*  So they would take on the losses when the loans soured. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1026.36s)]
*  And there was certainly criticism that came up from time to time about, hey, why are we [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1029.78s)]
*  letting the banks make all the profit here while we're subsidizing all of the risk? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1034.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1038.4799999999998s)]
*  A reasonable question. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1039.4799999999998s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1040.4799999999998s)]
*  So fast forwarding a little bit, how do we arrive at a moment where the federal government [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1041.4799999999998s)]
*  decides, maybe we will take on both the risk and the reward? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1046.24s)]
*  So the moment when everything changed was in 2010. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1052.06s)]
*  As part of the Affordable Care Act, weirdly enough, so President Obama wanted to pass [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1056.36s)]
*  the Affordable Care Act, this very massive and expensive change in the health care system, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1060.82s)]
*  and the government went looking for what it calls pay-fors. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1067.32s)]
*  It went looking for ways to- Revenue generators. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1069.6799999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1072.1s)]
*  Things that they could put into the budget and say, look, we're now making money, so [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1073.1s)]
*  this is going to balance out. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1075.82s)]
*  And this was the area they zeroed in on. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1077.5s)]
*  Student loans. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1079.1399999999999s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1080.1399999999999s)]
*  Make any money from it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1081.22s)]
*  Well, that was the calculation. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1082.22s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office and other financial analysts came back and said, if [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1084.26s)]
*  you take this in-house, if you start making these loans directly and keeping the profits [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1088.6200000000001s)]
*  from them, that's going to generate tens of billions of dollars over the next decade for [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1092.3000000000002s)]
*  the government. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1097.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1098.26s)]
*  And for the first few years, that is how it starts to play out. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1099.26s)]
*  And then that starts to change for kind of two reasons. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1104.14s)]
*  The first is that the amount of money people owe starts to really surge, and that both [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1108.32s)]
*  makes it significantly harder for them to pay it off. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1113.2s)]
*  You start to see more defaults and more people struggling with this debt, and it also starts [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1116.04s)]
*  incentivizing the government to look at ways to make it more affordable. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1121.2s)]
*  So you start to see them introduce more loan forgiveness programs, more repayment options [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  that are more generous and more flexible, things where it means that the government [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1131.04s)]
*  starts to be subsidizing this program more heavily. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1134.52s)]
*  And making less money. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1136.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1138.72s)]
*  The math on this starts to change, and this moves from being an income center to the government [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1139.72s)]
*  to an area of projected losses. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1144.24s)]
*  Was there a conversation in this period about whether the government's approach to this [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1150.24s)]
*  is making college more expensive? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1157.04s)]
*  Because that seems like a clear link. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1160.24s)]
*  If the government is the provider of these loans, and it's going to forgive lots of the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1163.6s)]
*  loans as they get bigger and bigger, what incentive do colleges and universities have [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1167.6399999999999s)]
*  to put a cap on the price of going to college? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1173.4399999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1177.0s)]
*  That's been a running conversation for at least 20 plus years. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1178.0s)]
*  Even before the government pulled this all in house, there was concerns from economists [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  and policy analysts that this was driving the cost of tuition going up. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1184.9599999999998s)]
*  Again, there's no other loans that really work like this. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1189.36s)]
*  If you're borrowing for your undergraduate degree, you can borrow tens of thousands of [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1192.08s)]
*  dollars. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1196.36s)]
*  And if you're borrowing for a graduate degree, you can borrow basically an unlimited amount [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1197.36s)]
*  of money. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1201.6399999999999s)]
*  There's no test of, are you likely to be able to make enough to pay this? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1202.72s)]
*  So that's how you get to a place where when you basically hand students, and really hand [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1206.9199999999998s)]
*  the schools, a blank check, suddenly the price goes up a lot. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1212.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1216.36s)]
*  Well, for the think of argument, what would it look like for the federal government to [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1217.36s)]
*  get out of the student loan business and to return to the pre-Obama era, where it's [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1220.24s)]
*  really the private sector in charge of this? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1225.92s)]
*  And would that likely create a more predictable, less confusing, whipsawing system? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1228.76s)]
*  And, just to make this question even more complicated, might that lower the cost of [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1236.16s)]
*  tuition? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1241.32s)]
*  I think the answer to all of that is it's unclear. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1242.32s)]
*  There's a lot of different options for how you could change the system if you were going [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1245.76s)]
*  to. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1249.56s)]
*  You could simply go back to the pre-2010 system and just say, this is the banks and we're [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1250.56s)]
*  just here to backstop it. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1254.12s)]
*  So that's one possibility. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1255.24s)]
*  As for tuition, I think people think the biggest issue there would be capping the amount that [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1257.12s)]
*  people can borrow. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1261.68s)]
*  Banks potentially might say, this is the limit you can take, which currently doesn't exist. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  Banks or the government or someone coming in and putting a limit in place, because that [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1268.8799999999999s)]
*  would force the schools to respond to that. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1272.36s)]
*  Right now, a lot of what's driven tuition is that they can do it and nobody is sort [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1275.84s)]
*  of forcing the price constraint here. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1281.1999999999998s)]
*  Is it fair to ask whether what Trump is doing here by forcing the system to go back to its [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1284.6s)]
*  original state five years ago is that he is forcing us to reckon with all the things we're [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1290.32s)]
*  talking about here and to perhaps rethink the government's role? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1296.9599999999998s)]
*  Is that a healthy exercise because of the confusion, because of the tuition costs that [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1301.0s)]
*  are unconstrained by the current system? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  How many times in this conversation have you basically said the system is broken? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  Biden was trying to fix it through ad hoc amnesty and forbearance. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1314.6799999999998s)]
*  Is what Trump is trying to do here a very different version of fixing it through a kind [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1319.76s)]
*  of brute force, tough medicine? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1324.8s)]
*  It's only the fact that we are on track right now for huge numbers of delinquencies, huge [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1329.44s)]
*  numbers of defaults that creates the conditions in which you would hope people would take [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1334.72s)]
*  a close look at the system and say, what can be done better? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1339.88s)]
*  How can we fix this? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1342.88s)]
*  That said, part of why we've had this conversation so many times is that's kind of been the shape [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1344.64s)]
*  of the system for much of the last decade across multiple presidential administrations, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1350.3400000000001s)]
*  Democratic and Republican. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1355.4s)]
*  This has been for a very long time a really broken system. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1357.46s)]
*  And unless Trump does try to take it out of the government's hands or do something pretty [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1361.58s)]
*  radical, he will simply extend the brokenness without any upside. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1365.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1370.9s)]
*  And that's what we just don't know. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1371.9s)]
*  I mean, really, there's a lot of options here, but the administration has not laid out any [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1372.9s)]
*  clear policy plans whatsoever here. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1377.38s)]
*  So no one's clear on is this a moment when we're actually going to make critical changes [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1380.1000000000001s)]
*  to the system or are we just going to do what we've been doing for a long time now [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1384.66s)]
*  of limping along with this broken system and leaving borrowers to kind of fend for themselves [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1389.46s)]
*  and dealing with it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1394.02s)]
*  And if that is the case, if the system limps and borrowers are left to pay these huge bills, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1395.5600000000002s)]
*  I want to go back to something you said in the beginning about delinquency and default. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1400.6200000000001s)]
*  What does the world look like in six to nine months, a year, a year and a half, if we start [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1405.1000000000001s)]
*  to see those millions of defaults? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1410.14s)]
*  It's obviously really catastrophic for individual people and their households. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1413.9s)]
*  The effects of delinquencies and defaults really stick with you. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1417.9s)]
*  For delinquencies, it's going to mess up your credit score. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1420.9s)]
*  It's going to make it really hard for you to get loans and financing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1423.6200000000001s)]
*  It's going to make it much more expensive for you to do that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1426.92s)]
*  That often stops people from being able to afford the things they need for their daily [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1429.7800000000002s)]
*  lives, from housing to a car to things like that. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1433.3000000000002s)]
*  But it's also bad for the economy writ large. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1436.52s)]
*  If people are having to really constrain their household spending, you're not going out [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1439.18s)]
*  to dinner, you're not going out with your friends. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1442.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1444.34s)]
*  Just a wet blanket over the entire economy. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1445.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1446.7s)]
*  So that's one area of concern. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1447.7s)]
*  It also sort of does raise the broader question about the entire system, about is this worth [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1450.5s)]
*  it? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1457.22s)]
*  You do see people, teenagers, people in their early 20s, questioning the concept, saying, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1461.08s)]
*  do I want to go to college? [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1467.62s)]
*  Do I want to take on tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of debt that's going [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1469.06s)]
*  to chase me around for decades and decades? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1474.82s)]
*  And that does sort of take us back to right where we were in the 60s of deciding how much [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1478.82s)]
*  we as a society want to invest in this and how broadly available higher education really [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1483.62s)]
*  will be. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1490.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, Stacey, appreciate your time. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1491.3799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1497.3799999999999s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1498.7s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1504.7s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1511.7s)]
*  On Sunday night, The Times reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed information [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1515.22s)]
*  about forthcoming airstrikes in Yemen in yet another Signal Messaging Chat, this time with [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1522.26s)]
*  a group that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1529.22s)]
*  The latest revelation raises even more questions about Hegseth's judgment and about Trump's [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1534.7s)]
*  decision to appoint Hegseth to oversee the U.S. military. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1541.02s)]

*  I'm Michael Bavaro. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dJV7mswlKE&t=1579.8200000000002s)]
