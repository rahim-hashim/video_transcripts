# What Warren Buffett Understood About Capitalism
**New York Times - The Daily:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=4.38s)]
*  A few days ago, the most successful investor in history, Warren Buffett, said he would [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=12.88s)]
*  retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate that he built into a $1 trillion colossus. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=19.14s)]
*  Today, my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin, on his front row view of the man who both personified [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=28.56s)]
*  and critiqued American capitalism. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=36.68s)]
*  It's Wednesday, May 7th. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=43.96s)]
*  Okay, shall we? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=47.96s)]
*  I'm going to be old until my glasses. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  Mine were already on. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=55.4s)]
*  I guess I'm old. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=56.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=57.4s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=59.36s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=60.36s)]
*  You were actually in the room when Warren Buffett broke the news to the world that he [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=61.36s)]
*  was going to be retiring. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=68.44s)]
*  Can you set that scene for us? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=71.0s)]
*  It was a remarkable moment, really just the end of an era in the world of capitalism. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=73.3s)]
*  But let me just take a full step back, if I could, to explain. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=78.4s)]
*  Everyone will please take their seats. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  We're at the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, which is really known as Woodstock [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=87.04s)]
*  for capitalists. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=91.48s)]
*  Tremendous phrase. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=92.48s)]
*  This is my 60th annual meeting. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=93.48s)]
*  And it's the biggest, and I think it'll be the best yet. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=96.48s)]
*  Every year, 40-something thousand people descend on Omaha, making a pilgrimage there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=106.72s)]
*  And these are people from all over the world, all walks of life. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=113.4s)]
*  My name is Brevi Panida. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=116.2s)]
*  I was born in communist Albania. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=117.2s)]
*  My name is Jackie Han. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  I'm from China. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=120.96s)]
*  My name is Benjamin Graham Sanderson from Pasadena, California. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=122.36s)]
*  Warren, thank you for all you taught us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=125.92s)]
*  And you get people from California and New York. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=127.56s)]
*  You get people from China. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=130.16s)]
*  I'm Dorcas Tang. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=131.88s)]
*  I'm 14 years old. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=133.12s)]
*  My father brought me here for two consecutive years. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=134.76s)]
*  You get people bringing their kids so they can see it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=139.38s)]
*  You see business school students and you see grandparents. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=143.0s)]
*  It is across the board. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=147.12s)]
*  My question is for all of us, but it's probably especially for the younger people in the room. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=149.28s)]
*  The importance of... [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=155.92s)]
*  They literally sit for hours as Warren Buffett takes questions from the audience. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=157.12s)]
*  There is no other corporate annual meeting in the world where this happens. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=164.04s)]
*  What advice do you have for young investors who are looking to develop their investment philosophy? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=169.12s)]
*  They may be everything from how he invested... [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=175.52s)]
*  Last year you mentioned Coca-Cola and American Express being Berkshires. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=179.52s)]
*  Some little detail about a unit inside of Berkshire. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=183.68s)]
*  Do you know and believe in Jesus Christ and have a personal relationship with him? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=187.0s)]
*  No, I'm an agnostic. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=190.8s)]
*  ...to whether he believes in God. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=192.84s)]
*  One of the big questions repeatedly is... [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=195.08s)]
*  Does all that mean you are semi-retired or if not, please explain? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=197.04s)]
*  When are you going to retire? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=203.68s)]
*  I've been semi-retired for decades. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=205.68s)]
*  And of course, he would never say when, but we all were waiting and waiting. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  And so this year, I got there on that Saturday morning and something felt different. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=214.56s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=220.2s)]
*  And then we get to about 1254 in the afternoon and he says... [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=225.2s)]
*  With that I should say that I'm getting a section that says five minute warning exclamation point, five minute warning exclamation point. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=230.2s)]
*  So I would... [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=238.72s)]
*  I'm getting a message that we have a five minute warning. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=240.04s)]
*  And the second he said that, I knew. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=243.6s)]
*  Tomorrow we're having a board meeting of Berkshire. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=248.2s)]
*  And I'm looking in the front section. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=254.44s)]
*  All of a sudden, everyone's sort of looking at each other. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=257.03999999999996s)]
*  And literally, without any almost notice, he says... [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=259.64s)]
*  The time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=264.52s)]
*  It's about time that his successor succeeds him and that he steps away at the end of the year. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=276.68s)]
*  What was the reaction? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=282.68s)]
*  I mean, people are tearing up and everybody starts to stand and clap. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=283.92s)]
*  And the standing ovation could have gone on for I don't know how long. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=293.36s)]
*  OK, drink your Coke and calm down. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=296.72s)]
*  And it really felt like the end of an era. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=301.36s)]
*  So there are going to be listeners who hear you describing this reaction. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=306.68s)]
*  And think it's crazy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=314.92s)]
*  And think it's a little bit out there. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=315.92s)]
*  And so I think we need to talk about how it is that a CEO could inspire the kind of decades [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=318.04s)]
*  long devotion and in this moment emotion that occurred. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=325.6s)]
*  It's totally singular. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=331.64s)]
*  It's reserved for, you know, popes and musicians, the occasional actor. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=333.52s)]
*  And I want to know what you make of it and also kind of how you wrap your head around it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=342.35999999999996s)]
*  He is without question the most successful investor in America. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  He has made more money and has a better track record than just about anybody. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=354.52s)]
*  And just to put this in context, if you had invested a hundred dollars with this man in [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=361.68s)]
*  1965 when Buffett bought control of Berkshire, that would be worth two point eight million [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  dollars today. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=373.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's unfathomable. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=374.44s)]
*  A hundred dollars to two point eight million dollars. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  And so many of the people in that room went on that ride with him or wished they could. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  Or hope that someday they will. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=388.76s)]
*  That's the obvious reason that so many people look to Warren Buffett in this very unique [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=390.96s)]
*  and special way. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=397.28s)]
*  But the truth is, I've been grappling with his role for a long time and specifically [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=398.28s)]
*  on Saturday, actually after the news broke, I got a call from an editor who said, hey, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=404.24s)]
*  would you think about writing about Buffett? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  Maybe you can try to capture this idea that he is the avatar of American capitalism. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=414.24s)]
*  And I sort of sat there thinking to myself, I don't know if that's totally right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=422.16s)]
*  I don't know if he is the avatar of capitalism as we know it today. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=426.64s)]
*  Why not? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=431.6s)]
*  Because in so many ways, he actually sits outside of it. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=432.64s)]
*  He sits apart from the system that we know, the corporations that we know, the ideas around [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=436.88s)]
*  wealth that we know. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=445.84s)]
*  And in many ways, as I contemplated it, I think Warren Buffett really is today the conscience [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=448.92s)]
*  of capitalism. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=456.74s)]
*  And let me just say, I don't mean to suggest for a moment that he doesn't believe in capitalism. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=458.74s)]
*  He would tell you that he is a card carrying capitalist and I think he may even have a [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=464.4s)]
*  business card in his wallet that says that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=468.2s)]
*  Lest there be any doubt. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  What I mean is that he has a moral code and he has approached his business in a particular [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=473.52s)]
*  way that has engendered a unique level of trust, not just among his investors, but among [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=482.46s)]
*  the public, among policymakers in a way that is so very different from the way most people [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=491.36s)]
*  think about business today. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=497.1s)]
*  I want to dissect that phrase, conscience of capitalism. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=499.2s)]
*  It's a pretty loaded phrase and I want to have us talk about the two elements of it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=503.36s)]
*  The first, conscience, clearly suggests a kind of corrective influence over capitalism. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=508.76s)]
*  The other, capitalism, suggests as you just got at, a pretty open embrace of free markets. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=515.72s)]
*  So let's start with the easier of those two, which is the capitalism. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=523.44s)]
*  Few people clearly have practiced capitalism as wildly successfully as Buffett. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=528.72s)]
*  So just remind us how he does that, the model of capitalism that gives us this company, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=535.12s)]
*  Berkshire Hathaway. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=542.72s)]
*  So the fascinating thing about Buffett is he comes out of school and decides to be what's [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=543.72s)]
*  called a value investor, which means he's looking for companies that are undervalued. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=550.08s)]
*  And his initial approach is this idea that he's going to buy what he used to call cigar [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=555.08s)]
*  butts, this idea that he was going to buy cheap, almost failed companies that had one [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=560.44s)]
*  more puff in them. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=565.0400000000001s)]
*  And he had a business partner named Charlie Munger who told him, this is not the way. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  The way you're going to make real money long-term is to buy good businesses, hold them, own [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=573.68s)]
*  them and grow them. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  Cigars with many puffs in them. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=584.2399999999999s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=585.2399999999999s)]
*  And he did it remarkably. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=586.68s)]
*  And over the years, he has assembled this collection of assets that he owns. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=588.28s)]
*  Everything from Burlington Northern, the train company, to Fruit of the Loom, to Duracell, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=595.9599999999999s)]
*  the battery company, to Seas Candies. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=602.28s)]
*  He owns hundreds of these type of businesses. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=605.8399999999999s)]
*  And then on top of that, he owns stakes in some of the biggest iconic companies, Coca-Cola, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=607.8s)]
*  American Express, and he is the largest owner of Apple. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=615.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=619.92s)]
*  And this one-time textile business, Berkshire Hathaway, becomes one of the largest companies [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=620.92s)]
*  in the world. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=628.88s)]
*  And not only that, one of the largest companies in the world with the biggest cash balance [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=630.96s)]
*  sheets in the world. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=637.52s)]
*  What does that mean really? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=638.72s)]
*  So if Burlington Northern is super profitable, he can take the cash that's coming off of [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=640.36s)]
*  that and maybe he decides, I want to invest even more money in Seas Candies. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=646.6800000000001s)]
*  And so he's constantly able to sort of move the profits from one business to another. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=652.44s)]
*  And he would tell you that his greatest talent is what he would call capital allocation, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=659.16s)]
*  this idea that he is better at moving money and identifying where the next big opportunity [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=665.28s)]
*  is than just about anybody else. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=672.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=674.7199999999999s)]
*  And my sense from my reading about Buffett through the years is that this ecosystem he [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=675.7199999999999s)]
*  has allows him to do what his business partner, Charlie Munger, said was so essential, which [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=681.0s)]
*  is hold companies for a long time, nurture them. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=686.16s)]
*  And that's what having lots of money from one business and putting it in another allows [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=691.04s)]
*  him to do. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=694.92s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=697.36s)]
*  And the other thing is because his public thesis is that he's going to hold these businesses [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=698.36s)]
*  for a very long time, there are a lot of people who have been willing to sell him businesses [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=704.1999999999999s)]
*  at probably lower values than they would sell to somebody else. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=709.68s)]
*  Because they know that he's genuinely trying to take care of these businesses and he wants [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=714.44s)]
*  them to last as humanly possible. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  And he will hold on to these businesses, even businesses that are struggling far longer [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=721.3000000000001s)]
*  than just about anybody else. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's that long term thinking that makes him so admired, but also the way he approaches [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=728.86s)]
*  his life. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=737.44s)]
*  You can write it off as sort of a folksy charm, but this is a guy who's worth something on [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=740.04s)]
*  the order now of one hundred and sixty plus billion dollars with a B, who is living in [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=745.4s)]
*  the same house that he bought in 1958 for thirty one thousand dollars. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=752.04s)]
*  And up until just a couple of years ago, he would drive his own car to work and he would [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=758.04s)]
*  go to McDonald's and go through the drive through like everybody else. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=764.04s)]
*  And so in an era of billionaires and yachts and homes and cars and planes and this and [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=769.1s)]
*  that, Warren Buffett has never been that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=777.5s)]
*  You know, at one point he actually did buy a private plane. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=781.82s)]
*  What did he name his plane? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=786.2s)]
*  What did he name it? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=787.7s)]
*  The indefensible. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=788.7s)]
*  Because it's indefensible to own a private plane. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=789.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=792.58s)]
*  And so it's that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=796.1s)]
*  I think it's that ethos, that trust that's really allowed him to critique the system [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=797.3s)]
*  and to say things publicly, aloud about the business world that often go unsaid and to [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=804.9s)]
*  identify where the charlatans really are in business. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=811.66s)]
*  And that's really one of the things beyond being a great investor that's made him the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=817.26s)]
*  conscious of capitalism. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=822.66s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=835.06s)]
*  So Andrew, talk about Warren Buffett's critiques of capitalism and the things he said that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=840.06s)]
*  most CEOs leave unsaid and why those things ultimately mattered. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=845.3399999999999s)]
*  Look, he's really highlighted and pointed the finger at what he thinks of as the ills [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=853.18s)]
*  of the system. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=858.66s)]
*  So he has spoken critically of Wall Street and Wall Street banks and bankers and this [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  idea, for example, that the advice that they're offering you is necessarily good advice. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=867.62s)]
*  You do not want to ask an investment banker what he thinks the earnings are going to be [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=875.86s)]
*  in five years or something he's trying to sell. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=878.9s)]
*  He often says, you know, it's the old story. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=881.54s)]
*  Don't ask the barber whether you need a haircut. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=883.14s)]
*  You would never go to a barber and ask them whether you need a haircut because, of course, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=885.26s)]
*  they're going to tell you need a haircut. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=890.4200000000001s)]
*  Just like every banker is going to tell you, of course, you need to either go do this merger [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=892.0600000000001s)]
*  or buy this thing or do whatever. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=896.34s)]
*  Can you peel back the layers of that a little bit? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=899.1s)]
*  What exactly is it about bankers? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=900.94s)]
*  Sometimes they're probably right, right? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=904.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, bankers get it right. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=905.38s)]
*  Sometimes bankers get it right. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=907.66s)]
*  They've paid an enormous fortune typically for what they do. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=908.74s)]
*  And I think that one of the things he's just tried to point out to people is that the bankers [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=913.02s)]
*  might not really always have your best interests at heart. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=918.2199999999999s)]
*  I would say that people that are now investing in hedge funds in aggregate are going to be [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=921.6999999999999s)]
*  disappointed. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=926.42s)]
*  And he's also been a critic of hedge funds. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=927.42s)]
*  And believe me, people don't become a genius because you walk into some office and it says [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=929.14s)]
*  hedge funds on the door. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=933.5799999999999s)]
*  These are the biggest investors in the world these days who've made the most money. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=935.14s)]
*  And he would tell you, don't invest your money with a hedge fund. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=939.18s)]
*  Why not? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=942.42s)]
*  He would tell you that your returns long term will be better literally buying an index fund [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=943.42s)]
*  like the S&P 500. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=949.74s)]
*  And he would say accurately that the S&P has outperformed most hedge funds after fees. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=952.14s)]
*  So one of the things he also talks about is just how so many of these firms are all just [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=959.98s)]
*  trying to extract fees from the people who are giving them the money. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=967.14s)]
*  And it's that kind of advice and that willingness to sort of talk about what the fine print [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=971.78s)]
*  really says that I think has ingratiated him with large swaths of the public. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=977.9s)]
*  Can I just ask you a question? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=983.82s)]
*  Is his critique of the bankers, the hedge funds? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=985.14s)]
*  Is it a moral one? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=989.78s)]
*  Like what they're doing is fundamentally not right in his mind? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=991.3399999999999s)]
*  Or is it that there are just better ways to make money than to do things the way that [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=995.78s)]
*  those folks do things? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1000.62s)]
*  Or is it both? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1002.1s)]
*  I think he thinks it's a better way. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1003.9399999999999s)]
*  It's a safer way. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1005.9399999999999s)]
*  And maybe ultimately it's a more moral way. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  He's not a shortcut taker. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1010.3399999999999s)]
*  He's a long term investor. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1012.74s)]
*  He really did try to teach the American investor not to think about owning a share of stock [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1015.74s)]
*  for a month or two or 10 days or a year, but to think, okay, if I buy it now, what's this [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1023.86s)]
*  business going to be like five years from now? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1030.58s)]
*  What's going to be like 10 years from now? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1033.82s)]
*  And not your little share, but what's the whole company going to be worth? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1036.02s)]
*  As if you really are an owner. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1039.54s)]
*  As an example of just how long term a thinker he is, what's called the class A stock of [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1042.38s)]
*  Berkshire now trades, if you can believe this, at $800,000 a share, a share. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1049.0200000000002s)]
*  So most- [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1056.74s)]
*  You could spend your whole life trying to buy one share and not afford it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1057.74s)]
*  And you might say to yourself, well, what is going on here? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1060.66s)]
*  Because most companies try to keep their shares, sometimes $10 a share, 20, 30, 40, $100 a [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1062.7s)]
*  share, maybe $200. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1069.3400000000001s)]
*  And that's part of the thing. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1070.94s)]
*  He's created this stock at this price, which effectively means that if you are in it, you [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1072.98s)]
*  are in it. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1080.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1081.06s)]
*  And you're in it for a very long time. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1082.06s)]
*  By design. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1083.6200000000001s)]
*  By design. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1084.6200000000001s)]
*  The other thing, Andrew, I think of when I think of Buffett's outspokenness and his criticism [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1085.6200000000001s)]
*  of our system is what he said about what you're supposed to do with money once you've made [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1090.6000000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1095.3s)]
*  And here I'm thinking about what he said about taxes and about philanthropy. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1096.3s)]
*  So just talk to us a little bit about that. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1099.4s)]
*  He is famous for wanting higher taxes on the wealthy, including himself. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1102.0800000000002s)]
*  And he has said it over and over again that his secretary is taxed at a higher rate than [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1108.92s)]
*  he is and it's not right. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1115.16s)]
*  During the Obama years, there was actually a tax provision that was named after Warren [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1118.44s)]
*  Buffett to raise the taxes on capital gains. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1124.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm guessing it didn't go through. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1129.2s)]
*  It did not go through. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1130.2s)]
*  There's very few people in the business world who are screaming from the rooftops, tax me [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1132.0800000000002s)]
*  and tax me more. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1137.94s)]
*  Warren Buffett actually was one of those people. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1140.2s)]
*  And on philanthropy, he's pledged to give all of his money away. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1143.8000000000002s)]
*  And he's been very outspoken about it, actually created what's called the giving pledge with [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1148.76s)]
*  Bill Gates and Melinda Gates many years ago to really try to incentivize and frankly [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1153.48s)]
*  pressure billionaires to start giving away a lot more of their fortune. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1160.6s)]
*  But he's now actually come out quite publicly lamenting the idea that he's actually made [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1166.32s)]
*  so much money that he can't give it all away, that he can't give it all away fast enough. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1171.8s)]
*  And he's actually worried about who's going to give it away. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1177.52s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1181.6s)]
*  Andrew, when we're thinking about all these critiques, I think a very natural, fair and [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1182.6s)]
*  important question here is how much did Warren Buffett actually live by the code he laid out? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1188.8s)]
*  You know, I don't want to suggest to you that Warren Buffett is perfect. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1196.9199999999998s)]
*  He is not. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1201.4399999999998s)]
*  And he oftentimes says as much. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1202.4399999999998s)]
*  And there are things that he does and says that a critic from the outside could easily [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1204.6s)]
*  say feels like hypocrisy. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1209.44s)]
*  What are examples of where people do point the finger? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1212.88s)]
*  Well, look, he's long talked about taxes and how he would like to be taxed at a higher [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1215.64s)]
*  rate. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1221.1200000000001s)]
*  Berkshire, the company, the way it's structured effectively is to avoid taxes. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1222.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not illegal. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  It's not even that clever. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1230.48s)]
*  But the way he's put it together, he's able to take those profits and rather than have [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1232.46s)]
*  the profits annually taxed, he's able to keep those profits inside the company. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1237.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, he bought Goldman Sachs during the financial crisis. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1243.04s)]
*  This was a firm that was widely critiqued at the time. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1247.1799999999998s)]
*  Now, he would say it was a great value investment and he was doing it effectively to save or [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1250.12s)]
*  at least to help save the system, if you will, at the time. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1254.56s)]
*  He extracted extraordinary fees for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders as a result. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1258.12s)]
*  But he effectively was investing in businesses that he has critiqued in many ways. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1263.3s)]
*  So there are certain things that he's talked about, and I believe he genuinely believes [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1268.8s)]
*  them in the whole. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1273.1399999999999s)]
*  But there have also been times where he has done or said something that contravened by [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  his decision that he contravened by his decisions. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1279.7s)]
*  He has talked about a lot of important social issues in the country, but he was never an [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1282.22s)]
*  advocate, for example, of DEI. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1287.76s)]
*  And I would ask him about that on the stage and say, your office is not particularly diverse. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1290.74s)]
*  He would say that's almost too politically correct an idea to address, that he only wanted [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1297.66s)]
*  what he called the most talented people and he was not interested in necessarily trying [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1302.98s)]
*  to find somebody who didn't look like him for that job, for that reason. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1308.36s)]
*  Well, what do you say to the fact that he operates as a critic of capitalism? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1313.94s)]
*  But I can't think of anyone who did more to exploit the possibilities of capitalism to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1320.9s)]
*  make so, so, so, so much money. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1326.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, so much money that at a certain point you're sort of like, why are you even making [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1329.1000000000001s)]
*  even more money? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1333.42s)]
*  So let me, there's a big nuance in this, actually, with Warren Buffett, which is he is not a critic [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1334.42s)]
*  of capitalism, the concept. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1341.62s)]
*  He is its champion. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1344.4599999999998s)]
*  What he is a critic of is the ills of capitalism and the charlatans that are engaged in capitalism [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1346.26s)]
*  and those that are taking advantage of the weak in capitalism. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1354.86s)]
*  That's the role that I think he's played as a quote unquote conscience of capitalism. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1360.02s)]
*  I don't think he's here saying capitalism doesn't work or it's a problem or anything [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1365.58s)]
*  else. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1371.18s)]
*  I think he'll tell you over and over again there's no better way to do it. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1372.18s)]
*  Do you think that in the end, Buffett made capitalism any better? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1376.54s)]
*  You know, if you're asking me, did he fundamentally change policy, change regulations, for example, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1381.74s)]
*  around business, the way businesses behave on any given day, it's very hard to point [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1387.54s)]
*  to a long list. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1395.18s)]
*  But I do think it's very fair to say that he made investors, he made the public smarter. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1397.86s)]
*  And ultimately, if he actually did that, at least on the margins, he made the system better. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1405.3799999999999s)]
*  Just explain that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1413.62s)]
*  I mean, why does that make the system better? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1414.62s)]
*  I think Buffett ultimately made the world a little smarter about how the system really [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1416.9799999999998s)]
*  works. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1421.4599999999998s)]
*  And I think by the public understanding how the system really works, understanding that [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1422.9s)]
*  his secretary is paying a higher tax rate, by understanding that the hedge funds are [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1428.1000000000001s)]
*  trying to extract fees from you, by explaining that when you hear that there's an independent [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1433.3000000000002s)]
*  director on a board who's a professor, you might want to question how independent they [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1438.74s)]
*  really are because they probably need the money. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1443.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, there are these little things that he knows about, that he understands about [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1445.0600000000002s)]
*  the world of business. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1449.38s)]
*  And by educating the public about those things, you like to think that improves the system [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1450.38s)]
*  because there are fewer people to cheat. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1455.1000000000001s)]
*  I guess I want to end with the question, Andrew, that I think you're well situated to answer [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1458.8200000000002s)]
*  after spending all these years covering Buffett, which is, ultimately, what do you think motivated [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1463.94s)]
*  him through all this time? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1470.7s)]
*  I mean, he does not live large. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1472.6200000000001s)]
*  He wants to give all his money away. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1475.0600000000002s)]
*  I have a much better understanding in my mind of what motivated Jeff Bezos. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1477.62s)]
*  He wanted to build the everything store. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1481.98s)]
*  Or Elon Musk, who wants to save humanity and wants to get to Mars and wants to slash government [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1484.18s)]
*  down to size. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1491.62s)]
*  I'm much less clear in my head about what animates Buffett. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1493.6599999999999s)]
*  And I wonder if you've gotten a lot closer in your understanding. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1497.78s)]
*  I think I understand Buffett in this way, which is you're right. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1500.54s)]
*  I don't think that there's a grand vision, necessarily, to influence the world in the [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1504.6999999999998s)]
*  kinds of ways that an Elon Musk may want to influence the world. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1511.2199999999998s)]
*  I don't think there's an effort to want to impact politics, necessarily, the way some [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1515.1s)]
*  people with wealth do. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1521.86s)]
*  And the money for him, I think, is a scorecard. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1524.9799999999998s)]
*  I think that's all it is. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1528.02s)]
*  I think it's a contest of wits for him. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1529.1399999999999s)]
*  And what he wants, more than anything, I think, is actually to be this teacher about the system. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1532.86s)]
*  Think of anything he wants to be a successful role model of how a business could work on [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1540.42s)]
*  a long-term basis. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1545.5s)]
*  And I guess how capitalism could work. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1547.22s)]
*  How capitalism can work when it's done in the best of faith. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1551.78s)]
*  Well, Andrew, thank you very much. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1557.5s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1563.78s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1575.78s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1579.78s)]
*  India has conducted strikes inside of Pakistan in a major escalation in the long-running [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1584.34s)]
*  tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1590.06s)]
*  The strikes were retaliation for a massacre by armed militants that killed more than two [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1595.02s)]
*  dozen Indian civilians in the disputed territory of Kashmir. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1601.38s)]
*  Indian officials said they had struck multiple camps used by terrorists and took pains to [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1606.8600000000001s)]
*  say that no Pakistani military facilities had been targeted. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1612.78s)]
*  But Pakistan claimed that the strikes had killed civilians and that they would not go unanswered. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1617.86s)]
*  In a statement, the Pakistani government said, quote, the temporary pleasure of India will [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tgERCQNK4&t=1625.1399999999999s)]
