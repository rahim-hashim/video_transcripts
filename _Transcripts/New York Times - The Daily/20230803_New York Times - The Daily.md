# 43% vs. 43%: Why Trump and Biden Are Tied in Our New Poll
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4N82M0kLuE)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Today.
*  Now that Donald Trump has been charged in three different criminal cases, the biggest
*  question in American politics is whether it creates an opening for his Republican rivals
*  in the presidential race or disqualifies him in the eyes of general election voters.
*  My colleague, Nate Cohn, analyzes a new set of Times polls that answer those questions.
*  It's Thursday, August 3rd.
*  Hello again.
*  Hi Nate.
*  Is that what I think it just was?
*  The sounds I was hearing, was that a partner obligingly getting rid of an animal from your
*  apartment so that you could record with The Daily?
*  That is exactly right.
*  The things we ask of you all.
*  The dog was chewing on a treat and it occurred to me that there was like a hundred percent
*  chance that when you all really got down to listening to my audio, you were going to hear
*  the sound in the background or whatever.
*  I appreciate that.
*  Thank you.
*  So Nate, we wanted to talk to you because the Times just finished a series of major
*  polls about the state of the 2024 presidential race at a really important juncture when the
*  field is now fully formed and the front runner, Donald Trump, has now been indicted three
*  different times.
*  Most recently for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
*  And of course, we have learned from you to say that polls are not predictive.
*  They are snapshots in time.
*  But that said, let's start with the Times poll of Republican voters in the Republican
*  presidential primary, which feels very relevant at this very moment.
*  So top line, what did we find?
*  Top line, we found Donald Trump doing really well.
*  He had 54 percent of Republican primary voters to 17 percent for Ron DeSantis.
*  That's a 37 point lead.
*  Nate, I think the word you're looking for is crushing, not just very well.
*  I mean, that is a crushing lead.
*  It is a crushing lead.
*  It's much larger than the lead that Donald Trump ever had in the last Republican primary.
*  It's bigger than any of the leads Hillary Clinton had in 2016 or 2008.
*  It's the sort of range where Donald Trump is a overwhelming front runner, at least if
*  we have a big asterisk over all of his legal challenges.
*  Right.
*  Well, that brings me to the inevitable question.
*  How do we explain a lead that big after midterms in which candidates backed by Trump did pretty
*  And after several indictments of him in the past few months, this kind of a lead, given
*  all that, does not at all feel like an inevitability.
*  So how does the poll account for it?
*  Well, it accounts for it in one of the most straightforward and direct ways that a poll
*  can account for it.
*  According to our poll, Republicans overwhelmingly reject the notion that Donald Trump committed
*  serious federal crimes.
*  And they also believe that Donald Trump is likelier to beat Joe Biden than his rival
*  Ron DeSantis, even though, as you just mentioned in the last election, Donald Trump's candidates
*  seem to fare quite poorly while Ron DeSantis did well.
*  And never mind the fact, of course, that Donald Trump actually did lose to Joe Biden three
*  years ago.
*  Well, let's drill down to which Republicans you're referring to when you say that the
*  majority of them think Trump has done nothing wrong and that he's the strongest Republican
*  nominee to take on a Democrat.
*  The group that I'm most curious about is the Trump MAGA base, this reliable group of supporters
*  who seem to never abandon him no matter what.
*  So what does this poll find about that group of voters in this moment?
*  Well, the MAGA base doesn't account for all of Trump's support, but it is a lot of it.
*  The poll finds that the base of MAGA voters is about 37% of all Republicans.
*  And these are people who said that they had a very favorable view of Donald Trump and
*  said they strongly supported him in the Republican primary.
*  And look, that's a big group of Republicans.
*  It's more than one third of the party.
*  We talk about it a lot, but it's an enormous achievement for Trump.
*  And in our poll, none, that is zero of the respondents in this MAGA category, said that
*  Donald Trump has committed serious federal crimes.
*  Zero.
*  Zero.
*  Only 2% said that he did, quote, something wrong.
*  So this isn't a case where, you know, there are loyal Trump supporters that acknowledges
*  wrongdoing but still support him anyway because of his views on the issues or because they're
*  loyal to him.
*  They don't accept the premise that he's done something wrong here.
*  And that obviously goes a long way to explaining why they continue to support him.
*  Right, because in their mind, there's nothing, literally nothing to see here.
*  I mean, it's interesting because I think this gives us a little bit of a basis in data for
*  what we have kind of assumed of the Trump base, which is that it doesn't view an indictment,
*  any indictment, as any kind of harming factor to Trump.
*  In some ways, it may instead endear him to them.
*  Is that right?
*  It's possible.
*  We had one question that I think got at this, which is that we asked voters whether they
*  thought Republicans needed to stand with Trump in the face of these allegations or whether
*  it was OK if Republicans didn't stand by Trump.
*  Not even that they needed to be against him.
*  Just is it OK to not stand by Trump?
*  And over 90% of these MAGA voters said that Republicans need to stand by Donald Trump
*  in the face of these allegations.
*  Now I should say we finished this poll before Trump was indicted for his efforts to overturn
*  the election.
*  But there's not much reason to think this third indictment will change that view among
*  these voters.
*  And to this point, they have seen their guy is under attack and want to rally to his defense.
*  Not that they see something wrong on Trump's part and that they distance themselves from
*  him.
*  Got it.
*  So by my math, given that Trump has 54% of Republican voters supporting him, and given
*  how big the MAGA base is, there's still 17% of Republicans supporting him who aren't what
*  you would define as his MAGA base.
*  So who are these 17% and why are they with Trump, according to the poll, versus one of
*  his rivals?
*  Well, first, it's worth saying why we don't think they're part of the MAGA base.
*  That's because they either said they don't support Trump strongly when we asked them,
*  or they said they only have a somewhat favorable view of Trump.
*  So there's clearly something about him that they don't like too much.
*  In a lot of ways, they're broadly representative of all Republicans.
*  And we didn't really talk very much about the makeup of the MAGA base, but the MAGA
*  base is very populist.
*  It's blue collar.
*  It's very conservative.
*  This group of voters is more affluent.
*  It's likelier to say that they're only somewhat conservative or in some cases even call themselves
*  moderates.
*  They still have views that align with the Republican Party as a whole, but they're not
*  all in one camp.
*  And by their own account, they're open to candidates other than Donald Trump in the
*  primary campaign.
*  Now they're backing Donald Trump over the alternatives.
*  So they're not an automatic vote against him.
*  And in fact, they believe that Donald Trump is more electable than Ron DeSantis, and they
*  believe he's a stronger leader than Ron DeSantis.
*  But they do concede that Donald Trump is not as moral as Ron DeSantis.
*  So there are cracks there that hypothetically could lead them to support someone else if
*  the circumstances permitted it.
*  They are, in theory, movable.
*  And to that point, do we know how this 17% feels about this giant looming question of
*  the president's legal problems, the indictments, the trials, the potential that he might be
*  convicted before the election or at any moment, and the degree to which that's just a vast
*  liability for him?
*  So even among this group of voters who, again, they're willing to say that DeSantis may be
*  more moral than Trump, but they also reject the idea that Trump has committed serious
*  federal crimes.
*  And they also believe that Republicans ought to stand behind Trump in the face of these
*  allegations.
*  And I should note, by the way, that many of the persuadable voters who don't support Donald
*  Trump and in fact, prefer Ron DeSantis or another Republican candidate, they also think
*  that most of the voters who are open to Donald Trump don't think that he's done very much
*  wrong here.
*  And they may in fact see him as the victim.
*  Fascinating.
*  There's an information ecosystem that is in play here.
*  Most of these voters are getting their information from a conservative media landscape where
*  they're hearing that Donald Trump has been mistreated, the allegations are trumped up,
*  that no one else got charged for doing the same thing and so on.
*  And I think we should be open to the idea that if that media environment ever changed,
*  that maybe voters would become more receptive to a different message.
*  But at least in that context, the idea that Ron DeSantis can get up there and say Donald
*  Trump is a criminal is maybe it would break the ice or something, so to speak, on this
*  argument with the Republican base, but it could just as easily backfire.
*  So if you're Ron DeSantis, the number two in this race, and you and your campaign are
*  looking at this poll and we know they're looking at this poll, you have to conclude that there
*  isn't all that much math to play with, right?
*  I mean, where does he pick up voters if 37% are unpersuadable and an additional 17% are
*  deeply inclined to see Trump as not doing anything wrong and stronger?
*  So what issue, what strategy makes any sense for him based on this poll?
*  This is a weird thing to say, Michael, but I mean, I think that if you take all these
*  poll results at face value, it adds up to a comprehensive takedown of the DeSantis theory
*  of this race, the DeSantis theory of how they can win this election.
*  I don't think there's any good news for him here.
*  That doesn't mean that there's some other thing he couldn't do to get back in the game.
*  It's not in these results.
*  You know, if I were to explain the DeSantis case, I would say it's something like DeSantis
*  is the most electable.
*  He proved it last November.
*  DeSantis can actually get things done.
*  He did this huge conservative policy agenda in Florida while Trump couldn't get the wall
*  done and so on.
*  And then perhaps it's also that DeSantis owned a unique set of powerful issues that appealed
*  to Republicans like coronavirus and the fight against woke.
*  And I don't think our poll provides any reason to believe that those things are working for
*  him today.
*  Republican voters, as I mentioned earlier, they think that Donald Trump is likelier to
*  beat Joe Biden than Ron DeSantis, even though Trump lost last time and even though Trump's
*  candidates lost them in terms.
*  They think Trump is likelier to get things done than Ron DeSantis, even though Ron DeSantis
*  would seem to have a very impressive set of conservative policy accomplishments.
*  And whenever we tested the, I'll call them woke issues, like taking on woke businesses
*  or fighting the woke left in schools, they didn't fare that well.
*  It's not that Republicans disagreed and thought that Republicans shouldn't fight these fights
*  over woke.
*  They just thought that other values and other issues were more important.
*  So the idea that Ron DeSantis could overpower all of his other problems by talking about
*  this woke issue set doesn't seem to be supported here either.
*  And we didn't even talk about the coronavirus because that issue, which really brought Ron
*  DeSantis to national prominence, is in the rearview mirror at this point.
*  I'm having this image in my head of kind of Ron DeSantis' weapons as being kind of sticks
*  and stones against this kind of vast castle that is Donald Trump.
*  And they're just not effective.
*  There's nothing here for him.
*  If they want to come up with some other set of ideas, I would think that they mostly had
*  to not be in this poll.
*  If the weapon they were hoping for was in our poll, they need to go back to the armory
*  or something.
*  To finish my not that great metaphor.
*  I'm doing my best.
*  So that makes me wonder if there's a glimmer of hope in this poll, any glimmer of hope
*  for any of the other candidates who are even further down in this poll than DeSantis, your
*  Tim Scott's or your Mike Pence's, for example.
*  Is there one?
*  Well, they're pulling very low right now, Michael.
*  I mean, Tim Scott and Mike Pence are at three and two percent.
*  You know, I think that they haven't been tested on the national stage yet, you know, because
*  they haven't emerged as major players in this race.
*  Maybe if they did, it would go a lot better for them than it's gone for Ron DeSantis.
*  But given their extremely limited levels of support, the poll certainly doesn't offer
*  any cause for them to be hopeful either.
*  And, you know, I think that to your point about Fortress Trump, you know, a lot of what's
*  going on here is about Trump's strength.
*  It's not about DeSantis's weakness.
*  Certainly DeSantis's weapons aren't strong enough to bring down the castle.
*  But it's not obvious to me that the problem is the weapons as much as the fortress.
*  And Donald Trump is someone who's been at the top of the Republican Party for the better
*  part of a decade.
*  And Republican voters have rallied around him in the face of the kind of issues that
*  would ordinarily bring down a candidate.
*  So I don't see very much cause for anyone else to have hope here either.
*  And if you had to identify what this fundamental strength of Trump is and how he has found
*  a way to project it so successfully since you guys started doing this poll, what would
*  you say it is?
*  I think that the strength is his ability to dominate the Republican field and the national
*  media conversation.
*  You know, in our poll, we asked voters to tell us whether a word described Trump or
*  DeSantis better.
*  And Trump's best result on that was strong leader.
*  69% of Republicans said that described Trump best, 22% said DeSantis.
*  And I think that gets at the whole thing.
*  It's very difficult for Ron DeSantis to look like the guy who can beat Biden or can get
*  things done when Donald Trump is the one who's dominating him on the airwaves and in
*  the national conversation every day.
*  And strength and leadership are big advantages for a presidential candidate to command by
*  this kind of margin.
*  And you know, maybe there's something that could happen.
*  You know, certainly the legal allegations are a very unusual twist that we haven't seen
*  before.
*  But no candidate with this kind of a lead has gone on to lose a presidential primary
*  with this kind of advantage at this point of the primary season.
*  And in fact, Donald Trump's lead is basically twice as large as anyone who's ever gone on
*  to lose at this point in the primary.
*  So he's in a very strong position.
*  So to close out this poll, for now, it clearly dispels the wishful thinking, if we can call
*  it that, of those who within the Republican Party want to see Trump defeated.
*  There are a lot of them.
*  They're prominent, the never Trumpers who have invested both their time and their money
*  into the idea that someone can rise up and beat him.
*  And that, based on this poll, is just not looking likely unless somehow Trump is literally
*  disqualified from running through a criminal conviction before the primary is completed.
*  That's what it looks like here.
*  There's not much good news to go off of if you're hoping to defeat Donald Trump without,
*  you know, something from above coming in to shake up the race.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Nate, the Times did a second poll.
*  We just talked about the poll of Republican primary voters.
*  You all simultaneously did a poll of a potential general election in which Trump faces Joe
*  Biden.
*  And that seems quite plausible based on what you just told us about the Republican primary.
*  And because Biden doesn't have a very competitive primary, is that why you felt comfortable
*  with the second poll having just a head-to-head lineup?
*  That's exactly right.
*  And I'd add one more thing, which is that voters know these candidates really well.
*  I mean, ordinarily talking about the general election 15 months out might be a little ridiculous,
*  but we've had this election before.
*  These are not unfamiliar characters.
*  We've literally had this election before.
*  So I think it's OK to start talking about this, given how likely the matchup seems and
*  how familiar the public is with the candidates.
*  Right.
*  And just to be clear, we do not believe that any of the people in the Democratic race,
*  like your RFK juniors, are meaningful challengers to Biden at this moment.
*  We do not.
*  We had RFK at something like 13 percent.
*  Got it.
*  OK.
*  So what did this second poll, Trump v. Biden, find?
*  It found a tie.
*  Biden and Trump at 43 percent each.
*  Dead heat.
*  Dead heat.
*  Which on its face does seem like a surprise for the reason you just mentioned, Nate.
*  Biden faced Trump back in 2020 and won.
*  And you'd imagine that Trump's weaknesses, especially his legal problems, would be amplified
*  in a general election poll far and above how they would be in a primary poll.
*  So what does this tie tell us?
*  What does the poll tell us?
*  So you're right.
*  Trump is weak.
*  And that's what the poll finds.
*  While most Republicans may not think Trump committed crimes, a majority of voters do
*  think he's committed federal crimes.
*  A majority of voters also think that he was a threat to American democracy after the last
*  presidential election.
*  Majority of voters have an unfavorable view of him.
*  And he lost the last election, as you know.
*  But Joe Biden also has weaknesses.
*  A majority of voters don't have a favorable impression of Joe Biden.
*  A majority of voters think that Joe Biden has not done a good job as president.
*  And so there's a lot of voters who, when confronted with this Biden versus Trump matchup, they
*  simply seize up in polling terms, I suppose.
*  Ten percent of our respondents volunteered that they simply wouldn't vote or they would
*  vote for someone else if Donald Trump and Joe Biden were the candidates.
*  And those weren't options we listed to them.
*  Those were options they went out of their way to tell us when we presented them with
*  a presidential election matchup that looks increasingly likely.
*  What you seem to be saying is that President Biden hasn't found a way to exploit Trump's
*  weaknesses because he has his own real weaknesses as a candidate.
*  But let's really explore what those weaknesses are and how they emerge in the poll.
*  I would put his weaknesses into three buckets.
*  One is something that could be a problem for any president running for reelection, which
*  is that voters don't like the state of the economy and they don't think the country is
*  heading in the right direction.
*  An overwhelming majority of voters still think America is heading off on the wrong track.
*  And voters don't have a good impression of the economy either.
*  Even though there's a case that the economy is getting better, 49 percent of voters in
*  this poll said the economy was poor to just two percent who said it was excellent.
*  Those perceptions of the economy are much worse than they were in the summer of 2020
*  at the depth of the covid recession when businesses were closed and people were staying at home.
*  Now voters may not be right about whether the economy is better or worse than it was
*  then.
*  I'll leave that to the economists to debate.
*  What's clear is that Biden is certainly not getting credit for the improving economy yet,
*  and he may still be blamed for an economy that voters simply don't think is good at
*  all.
*  The second bucket, I think, is Biden's age.
*  In our poll, only half of Democrats think Biden should be renominated.
*  And half of those Democrats, in an open-ended question, volunteered that they thought Biden's
*  age or his mental acuity or his health were the reason why they thought someone else should
*  be nominated.
*  You presumably should be giving Biden the benefit of the doubt on all this stuff.
*  I just want to zero in on this.
*  You're saying half of Democratic voters in this general election poll, voters who in
*  theory should be quite faithful to their party's front runner, they don't think he should be
*  renominated.
*  And when you ask them an open-ended question of why and put it to them, didn't suggest
*  anything to them, didn't put anything in their mouth on this, they volunteer age.
*  I guess we should extrapolate that if Democrats feel that way, so do independents and
*  Republicans.
*  That's always a good rule of thumb.
*  If one party's base is upset at something about their party, you can only imagine what
*  the independents on the other side think about it.
*  So I think this is almost certainly a problem for Biden in some respect.
*  And I think the question that I have is, could it be the case that Biden's age is such a
*  severe drag on him, that it prevents voters from seeing him as doing an effective job,
*  even if he is by many sort of quantitative measures, like the number of pieces of legislation
*  he passes or the state of the economy, simply because he seems too feeble to believe he
*  could really be doing the job well.
*  I think that's a possibility.
*  How much of his problem is in the second bucket?
*  I don't know, but I think it's above zero.
*  Let's say that.
*  Okay, what's the third Biden weakness?
*  The third issue is a little bit different from the first two, and that's that Biden
*  is not faring well by traditional Democratic standards among Black and Hispanic voters.
*  Among all registered voters, Biden only has a 71 to 12 lead among Black voters, and he's
*  only at 41 to 38 among Hispanic voters.
*  Now, these are small subsamples.
*  Polls will have margin of errors ordinarily, and then when you drill down onto smaller
*  groups, those margin of errors get even bigger.
*  But we've seen these problems for Democrats and Joe Biden before in the midterm election.
*  Black turnout was really quite weak, and the Democratic challenge among Hispanic voters
*  has sort of been steadily increasing over time.
*  So although these are small samples, they're part of a story that I think we know is already
*  unfolding, and that is preventing Biden from maximizing his base of Democratic support
*  and getting his number up above 43.
*  Right, and I'm thinking if you're a Democrat, there's a little bit of a deja vu feeling
*  here because that long story you're describing is part of what really hurt Hillary Clinton
*  against Donald Trump in 2016, which was that Black voters didn't turn out in large numbers
*  for her.
*  Honestly, I think this is a notch worse than that.
*  What we see since 2016 isn't simply a low turnout among Black and Hispanic voters.
*  We increasingly see both Democratic turnout declining further and now Republicans beginning
*  to actually make gains.
*  So it's not just that non-white voters seem to be staying home.
*  It's that some more of the non-white voters who are turning out are supporting Donald
*  Trump and other Republican candidates.
*  And again, this is just one poll, small sample size, caveat, caveat, caveat, but that is
*  very present here again.
*  And that is holding back Biden's overall level of support in the poll.
*  Okay, so that helps us understand Biden's weakness.
*  And given that at this moment, he's tied with Trump at 43% of the electorate that was pulled
*  here, that leaves us with about 14% of the general election voters who seem up for grabs.
*  So what can you tell us about that group of people?
*  Well the main thing that characterizes this group is that they don't like either of these
*  candidates.
*  But to be honest, they're not a bad group for Democrats on paper and they're not a bad
*  group for Joe Biden on paper.
*  This is a group that's disproportionately young.
*  It's disproportionately Black and Latino.
*  It's disproportionately Democratic.
*  And maybe most importantly, it disproportionately supported Joe Biden in the last presidential
*  election.
*  Well, the fact that they supported Biden last time doesn't mean they'll support him again.
*  But it suggests that the Democrats and Joe Biden specifically ought to have an easier
*  time than Donald Trump making gains among this other 14% of the electorate.
*  So this could ultimately be a decisive group of voters in a general election matchup between
*  Trump and Biden?
*  It most certainly could be.
*  But they're not undecided in the sense that they don't know who these people are and will
*  have to make up their minds.
*  Again, these are people who are sort of recoiling at the thought of having to choose between
*  these two and maybe not even getting to the point where they can tell us the decision
*  that not only they made last time, but that they'll make again.
*  And there's also risk, of course, that they really don't vote or vote for someone else
*  and a third party candidate as an expression of that dissatisfaction.
*  Right.
*  So a general election featuring these two candidates could very much be about not just
*  who earns the affections of this 14% of voters who would break a tie, but who this 14% dislikes
*  the least.
*  Yes.
*  And right now, if the election is about who they dislike the least, it's really good for
*  Joe Biden.
*  I mean, this is a group that's very hostile towards Donald Trump, even if it doesn't love
*  Joe Biden by any stretch.
*  Now I do want to caution a little bit on how much upside there is for Joe Biden here.
*  If we take these voters and we assume that they'll vote in 2024 the same way that they
*  voted in 2020, Joe Biden's lead only grows to two points.
*  So it's not like there's some landslide around the corner once these 14% of voters make up
*  their minds.
*  Right.
*  That makes me want to touch on something you just mentioned, which is the possibility of
*  a third party candidate.
*  When you take math like a 2% lead or a tie, a decision by a third party to enter this
*  race, whether it's the Green Party or No Labels, which is thinking of putting up a candidate
*  election, that could prove extremely important with math this tight.
*  Yeah, it's not hard to imagine how a minor party candidate or a series of minor party
*  candidates could attract considerable support.
*  Back in 2016, the minor party candidates got something like 6% of the vote.
*  The voters are not as negative on Biden or Trump as they were on Clinton and Trump back
*  in 2016, but there's shades of 2016 here where the voters near the center of the electorate
*  really don't like either of these people, which was not true in 2020, where most voters
*  did have a favorable view of Joe Biden.
*  So, Nate, how are you thinking about the rest of this campaign, given the snapshot of the
*  race that we have just taken with these polls this many months before people start voting?
*  To me, the biggest takeaway is that it means that all of the events of the last few years,
*  the Stop the Steal movement, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, all these
*  criminal indictments, have not disqualified Donald Trump, at least not when he's facing
*  a Joe Biden with a 39% approval rating.
*  And this race is competitive, and at least right now, the Democrats have work cut out
*  ahead of them, and the events of the last three years haven't brought this race to an
*  early end, as some might have thought.
*  And if you're Joe Biden and you see this poll, and like DeSantis and his staff, you've
*  seen this poll, what do you do in response to it?
*  I think that if you're the Biden campaign, that your task is fairly straightforward,
*  not necessarily to pull off, but at least to identify.
*  You've got to convince voters the economy is good and hope that the news continues to
*  be good enough to potentially boost those numbers further.
*  You have to persuade voters that you're doing a decent job, and you'll probably never persuade
*  people that you're not too old to be president, but at least persuade them that you're good
*  enough to lead the country.
*  And then third, you have to remind voters of the reasons they didn't support Donald
*  Trump last time and why they continue not to like him in our poll, that a majority of
*  voters don't have a favorable view of the guy, think that he's a threat to democracy,
*  and think that he's committed serious crimes.
*  Whether Biden can execute on that easily is not the same as saying that the path is open,
*  of course, but I think that path is straightforward.
*  On the Trump side of the ledger, I think that is a little weirder to think about what Trump
*  needs to do in the same sort of terms, because the poll doesn't really suggest that he has
*  an obvious path to like 51% of the vote or something.
*  And I find it hard to believe that the people who believe he's a criminal or who believe
*  that he's a threat to democracy can be talked out of that too easily with the right words
*  on the trail.
*  But what you can do is continue to keep your path open by continuing to reinforce Biden's
*  weaknesses.
*  I think that Hunter Biden and Joe Biden are also involved in criminal conspiracies.
*  You can continue to appear as a vigorous and energetic candidate that maybe offers a strong
*  contrast to Joe Biden's age.
*  You can argue that the economy isn't good and that prices are higher and so on.
*  And that may not be a path to a majority.
*  Donald Trump has never won a majority.
*  But does it keep a path open to another narrow victory in these battleground states?
*  Maybe it does.
*  Well, Nate, as always, thank you very much.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  On Wednesday, jurors imposed a sentence of death on the gunman who killed 11 people at
*  a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, a massacre that is considered the deadliest anti-Semitic
*  attack in U.S. history.
*  The gunman, who repeatedly expressed anti-Semitism in online postings, did not dispute his guilt
*  during the trial.
*  But his lawyers argued that he should be spared the death penalty because of a history of
*  psychiatric problems and a troubled childhood, an argument that the jury rejected.
*  Today's episode was produced by Ricky Nowetzki, Stella Tan, Claire Tenesketter, and Mary Wilson.
*  It was edited by Liz O'Balin and Paige Cowan.
*  It contains original music by Mary Lozano and Alicia Baetube and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansfork of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  See you tomorrow.
