# 'Animal,' Episode 2:  Puffins
**New York Times Podcasts:** [June 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAoshwNpkCU)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Today we have something really special for you.
*  A blissful break from the news.
*  It's a new series from NYT Audio called Animal.
*  My colleague Sam Anderson from the Times Magazine traveled the world to have encounters with
*  animals.
*  Not to claim them or to tame them, but just to appreciate them.
*  Each episode is a journey to get closer to a creature that Sam loves.
*  For the next 6 weeks, we'll be running this limited series every Sunday here on the Daily
*  Feed.
*  But if you want to hear all the episodes right now, you can search for it wherever you get
*  your podcasts.
*  Today, episode 2.
*  Take a listen.
*  Walnut, stop it.
*  Hey.
*  Hey.
*  Hey.
*  Walnut.
*  No.
*  Oh, there once was a puffin, just the shape of a muffin.
*  And he lived on an island in the bright blue sea.
*  Smells like fish.
*  Yeah.
*  You smell that?
*  Yeah.
*  Where's that coming from?
*  The boat?
*  He ate little fishes that were most delicious.
*  And he had them for supper and he had them for tea.
*  But this poor little puffin, he couldn't play nothing.
*  For he hadn't anybody to play with at all.
*  It's the boat that smells like fish.
*  So he sat on his island and he cried for a while.
*  And he felt very lonely and he felt very small.
*  Then along came the fishans.
*  No doubt about what it smells like.
*  It smells like fish.
*  And they said, if he wishes, you can have us for playmates instead of for tea.
*  So they now play together in all sorts of weather and the puffin eats pancakes like
*  you and like me.
*  We're going.
*  Driving off the ferry.
*  I recently went to Iceland.
*  Foggy and rainy.
*  Yeah.
*  And I met my colleague, Caitlin Roberts.
*  It's like a movie set.
*  Yeah, it really is.
*  And not just a regular Iceland.
*  The green is so green.
*  I'm talking about extra super remote, sea spray, rocky cliffs, tiny island way off the
*  south coast of Iceland.
*  Proceed to the roof.
*  So we want to be going in.
*  Because on that island.
*  Maybe it's up here.
*  There is a single fishing village.
*  And in that fishing village, there is a house with a white door.
*  And when you knock on that door, you will be greeted by a very polite family.
*  A mom named Svava and her teenage son, Tristi.
*  And the dad, Sigi.
*  All of whom have invited you over for dinner.
*  Delicious food.
*  Thank you.
*  Very good.
*  Thank you.
*  Where are you from?
*  America.
*  I'm from the far west coast from a place called Oregon.
*  Have you been to the United States?
*  No.
*  And at first, it's going to be really awkward.
*  Because you're strangers.
*  Our daughter is going to a wedding now in Texas.
*  Texas.
*  Very American.
*  But.
*  No, I know all kinds of accents from America.
*  Over the course of the dinner.
*  I'm going to go ride the train with my horse called Buckley.
*  Buckley.
*  An Australian.
*  Do you came here to die?
*  No, I came here yesterday.
*  Things will loosen up.
*  I play guitar and vocals.
*  In general, vocals.
*  This is our sleepy music.
*  And eventually, you'll get around to the real reason you're here.
*  But puffins.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, puffins.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sam Anderson.
*  This is Animal.
*  Episode 2.
*  Puffins.
*  Why do you have some interest in puffins?
*  Good question.
*  Well, I first learned about puffins in second grade.
*  When a girl in my class stood up and read a poem about them.
*  I must have been seven years old.
*  About this lonely little puffin.
*  Stranded on an island with no friends.
*  And somehow he ends up eating pancakes that fish cooked for him.
*  I was enchanted.
*  And ever since then, I've held puffins deep in my heart.
*  These black and white seabirds with rainbow colored little beaks.
*  Who can swim and fly.
*  And carry like 20 fish in their beak at once.
*  They're amazing.
*  And then somewhere along the line.
*  I heard about this faraway island.
*  Where something unbelievable happens.
*  And I was like, what is this?
*  Where something unbelievable happens.
*  At the end of every summer, every year.
*  In the middle of the night.
*  Baby puffins start falling out of the sky.
*  And I just couldn't believe that that was real.
*  They crash onto doorsteps.
*  On top of people's cars.
*  Into storefronts.
*  Parking lots.
*  Everywhere.
*  It sounds almost biblical.
*  But it's just part of how puffins grow up in this part of the world.
*  I'm in Iceland.
*  Yeah, you're in Lesbania.
*  A baby puffin is called, and get ready because this is very adorable.
*  A puffling.
*  Or in Icelandic.
*  Luntapesja.
*  I've got to write it down.
*  The Luntapesja spends all summer deep in a burrow.
*  This muddy hole that's been tunneled into the cliffs.
*  And puffin parents only have one egg at a time.
*  So it's down there all by itself.
*  It sits there and it waits for its parents to bring big glistening beakfuls of silver floppy fish.
*  And when the baby puffin is theoretically big enough to survive on its own.
*  The parents just leave.
*  They ditch it.
*  And the little baby Luntapesja is abandoned in its hole.
*  Until one night.
*  All alone.
*  Very hungry.
*  The puffling climbs up to the opening of its burrow.
*  And it looks out at the ocean.
*  Where all the food is.
*  And it prepares to jump off the cliff.
*  And glide down to the freedom of the open sea.
*  Where it will spend the next several years.
*  Never touching land.
*  Swimming around.
*  Learning how to be a grown up puffin.
*  Diving for fish.
*  Finding a mate.
*  And eventually returning to the same cliffs.
*  To start the cycle again.
*  To have its own puffling.
*  But every year some pufflings get confused.
*  They don't see the ocean.
*  They think they're headed to the ocean.
*  They think they're headed toward the beautiful moonlight reflected on the water.
*  But instead they end up drifting down toward a well lit gas station.
*  Or someone's porch light.
*  Because they're not able to fly.
*  As pufflings.
*  They only know how to glide.
*  And when they land.
*  They are stuck.
*  Their little wings are really only good for gliding.
*  So they can't take off again.
*  They're land locked.
*  And stunned.
*  And if a puffling is just left there in the street.
*  All kinds of terrible things can happen.
*  Long story short.
*  It will not be growing up and having babies of its own.
*  Which just means a world with fewer puffins.
*  Which is not a world you or I want to live in.
*  So for generations.
*  During puffling season.
*  The families of Veseminaire.
*  Have been staying up all night.
*  To rescue these baby birds.
*  And release them back to the sea.
*  She was telling me.
*  There is one place on the island.
*  Where people could go on their balcony.
*  And hunt puffins from their house.
*  There is only one place.
*  In the world.
*  Hunting puffins.
*  Is also a family tradition here.
*  This part of Iceland is home to the biggest puffin colony on earth.
*  There are way more puffins than there are people.
*  Living there and never eating a puffin would be.
*  Like living in the middle of the greatest vineyard on earth.
*  And never trying a grape.
*  But you've never hunted puffins?
*  No. That's not in our family.
*  We are not a killer.
*  We just eat them.
*  Yeah. We just buy them after it's been killed.
*  It is a very, very nice food.
*  I like it. I love it.
*  We smoke it.
*  And have new potatoes and butter.
*  But I'm not here to eat puffins.
*  I've come here to save them.
*  Are they hard to kill?
*  Are they hard to catch? Are they quick?
*  Or what is it like?
*  Sik tried it.
*  They can be very hard to catch.
*  Some are just very calm.
*  And since Tristi has been doing this since he was tiny.
*  He's offered to be our Luntapesha guide.
*  What kind of mood is it in?
*  Confused and mad.
*  Puffling season only comes once a year.
*  And it only lasts for a few weeks.
*  So we had to come to Veseminaire at this exact moment.
*  Even though for me personally, the timing is awkward.
*  Because my daughter Greta, my own little precious fuzzy puffling,
*  is getting ready to go off to college.
*  And if you're wondering how this is going to go for me,
*  the other day at the grocery store I started crying when I saw her favorite brand of applesauce.
*  I like to come while it's still bright.
*  And I could maybe try to show you some puffins.
*  But these birds don't care about me and my stupid human timeline.
*  They will jump when they jump.
*  Which I'm hoping is soon.
*  So that I can hurry up and rescue them and still get home in time to send Greta off.
*  You sit in the front seat and that will be...
*  Do you want to hear what my mom says is unhealthy for my soul?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  But it's called To The Hellfire.
*  So as we head down toward the harbor, Tristey cranks up the music.
*  This is the ultimate puffin searching song.
*  Yes, we'll get them.
*  To come to us.
*  Katelyn, do you want the music on?
*  Maybe this is just a touchdown.
*  Because I just want to ask about what's the strategy here?
*  It is just patience.
*  And looking out for the tiniest little dots that might resemble a puffin.
*  Okay, what does a puffin look like?
*  What are we looking for?
*  A little black ball of feathers.
*  Let's go up here.
*  You know those very dark British crime dramas where every day there's a grisly murder down at the docks?
*  Just gotta search every nook and cranny.
*  This looks like that.
*  And then if you see something, scream out.
*  Like torn chain link fences, huge buoys, industrial spools of rope.
*  Ah, no.
*  I don't think it is.
*  I think it's just a shadow.
*  It's just a shadow.
*  We're staring so hard.
*  Our eyes are popping out of our heads.
*  We're just looking for the tiniest hint of motion.
*  Where are you, guys?
*  Where are you?
*  When we don't see anything down at the harbor, we check out the rest of this tiny island.
*  We drive past the school.
*  Do you see anything?
*  Past the golf course.
*  Past this giant sculpture of a soccer ball on the side of a hill.
*  I don't see any out there.
*  Again and again.
*  Sometimes I think a lava rock is a puffin.
*  Sometimes I think a little clump of grass is a puffin.
*  Yeah, everything is a puffin when you're searching for them.
*  It's the middle of the night and there are no puffins.
*  I feel like this is like when my grandpa used to take us out to see Santa Claus on Christmas Eve night.
*  We'd look up at the sky and everyone would be searching around.
*  At some point he would act like he saw Santa Claus and we would all sort of pretend like we saw little lights in the sky.
*  We have 13 Santa Clauses in Iceland.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  So the Santa Clauses in Icelandic culture, they are like pranksters and kind of just assholes.
*  They all break into your house.
*  It's not like they sneak in through the chimney.
*  And we just keep looping around.
*  Past the school, past the golf course.
*  Past the soccer ball.
*  Past the school.
*  Past the golf course.
*  Past that soccer ball.
*  Past the docks.
*  Past the school.
*  Golf course.
*  Past the piece of lava that looks like a puffin but it's not.
*  Past the school.
*  The golf course.
*  Past the soccer ball.
*  The golf course.
*  Soccer ball.
*  Soccer ball so many times.
*  School.
*  Golf course.
*  Soccer ball.
*  Docks.
*  Soccer ball.
*  Should we get out and walk around?
*  We can do that.
*  It is now 10 million o'clock in the morning.
*  This is all about patience.
*  It's just being patient and enjoying the walk, enjoying the smell.
*  We're trying to enjoy it at least.
*  And then out of nowhere, we see it.
*  Puffling.
*  It tries to run but it has nowhere to go.
*  It's hemmed in by concrete walls.
*  And so we all go sprinting.
*  Toward this teeny panicking blob of feathers.
*  And Tristie lunges at it and just catches it with his bare hands.
*  Hi.
*  And here it is.
*  A real live puffling.
*  Nice job.
*  Down here in the loading dock.
*  Sleek with a black face and a bright white body.
*  It has this long sharp pointy beak.
*  You got one.
*  You got one.
*  It's very tiny.
*  You're being rescued.
*  Really flapping.
*  The puffling has some fuzzy gray down on the back of its head.
*  Which is a sign that it might still be a little on the young side.
*  And maybe wasn't quite ready to leave its burrow.
*  Wow, it's very tiny.
*  But it did leave its burrow.
*  It climbed right out to the edge of that hole.
*  And it made this brave leap of faith toward its new life.
*  And it totally failed.
*  Everything went wrong.
*  It smashed into pavement.
*  And now here it is clamped in place.
*  Now here it is clamped in a pair of human hands.
*  It must feel like it's being abducted by aliens.
*  Let him bite you.
*  The biting doesn't hurt at all.
*  It's the most adorable anger possible.
*  And we all just stand around beaming at this little guy.
*  Overjoyed.
*  We can't believe our luck.
*  All the little shadow.
*  And I was like, oh no, that's just a pipe.
*  And then it twisted and I was like, pipe stone twists like that.
*  This has to be by far the worst night of this baby animal's life.
*  But it's one of the best nights of my life.
*  I'm finally standing face to face, beak to nose.
*  With a living, breathing, squealing baby puffin.
*  Thank you so much.
*  It was a journey of puffing.
*  Have fun sleeping tonight.
*  So we pack up our little bird into a cardboard box
*  where she will spend a long, sleepless night scratching and squeaking
*  and making terrible smells.
*  I don't recommend cuddling with it.
*  Right at the foot of my bed.
*  You'll wake up covered in poop and you'll have to search for it.
*  While I am also not sleeping.
*  But it'll all be worth it because tomorrow we'll be sending her back out to sea.
*  Good night. Good night. Thank you.
*  Hi.
*  Our friend Tristey had to go to Reykjavik on band business.
*  So he called in some backup to help us.
*  Okay, so tour guide mode activated.
*  His friend Arnar.
*  My name is Arnar.
*  Arnar.
*  Yeah, it's probably a little hard to roll the R's, right?
*  I think I'm just going to say Arnar.
*  I'm sorry to him.
*  Tristey and me, we are best friends.
*  Arnar and Tristey are in a band together.
*  Do you sing too?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Me and Tristey, we do joint guitar and vocals.
*  And I always say vocals because it's not really singing.
*  Can you do the...
*  That's like the gremlin sound.
*  And then you can just do more general stuff.
*  I guess what I'm asking is for you to improvise a song about rescuing pufflings in your heavy metal voice.
*  You totally don't have to do this.
*  Oh no, I am so going to do this.
*  Searching down in the darkness below for the puffage of my soul.
*  Alright, something like that.
*  Arnar is a couple years older than Tristey.
*  They met in a karate class.
*  And like many islanders, he's been rescuing pufflings for as long as he can remember.
*  One memory that kind of sticks out, so I must have been around eight years old.
*  And we found a puffling that was like way too small.
*  So that means that you have to take care of it for like a couple of weeks to let it grow bigger.
*  So we did that.
*  We had him for three weeks, if I remember correctly.
*  I gave him a name and named him Kalli.
*  And he became my best friend.
*  He ate like cat food, chicken, and like a bunch of different stuff that we gave him.
*  And he was super funny as well.
*  And then the day came that he became big enough to release.
*  So we brought him out to the cliff and I throw him up.
*  And he looks kind of shaky at first, but he eventually kind of regains stability in flight.
*  And I'm like, yes, okay, finally he's safe.
*  See you in a couple of years.
*  But then he just starts taking a nosedive down.
*  And I'm like, okay, it's fine.
*  He just wants to be closer to the ocean.
*  He eventually basically gets turned around and flies directly into the cliff and just explodes basically.
*  And I was like, no, Kalli!
*  And then I started crying.
*  It was a harsh lesson in how brutal nature can be.
*  And it's just like, what are you going to do?
*  So here we are at Hamar, or the cliff.
*  This is the most common spot where people take them.
*  Hi little buddy.
*  We're going to get you out to the ocean, okay?
*  Okay.
*  He doesn't like my soothing words.
*  I have to say, it feels weird to be rescuing a baby animal by throwing it off a cliff.
*  This is an exciting time. This is your first time releasing a puffling.
*  Yeah. I know.
*  But that's what pufflings like.
*  And so that is what we're doing.
*  I am afraid something's going to go wrong and he's going to blow back into the cliff and die.
*  Well, I believe in you.
*  I mean, the wind is blowing very hard at the cliff.
*  Very, very hard.
*  It is really windy out here.
*  Okay, so you can just put the box down here and pick him up.
*  So you want to basically cradle him with both of your hands.
*  You want to keep the wings in.
*  The technique is basically the same as swinging a kettlebell at the gym.
*  Yeah, I do the kettlebell. It's the easiest.
*  You've got to spread your legs really wide and hunch down and your arms just hang straight between your legs.
*  So if I throw him, isn't he just going to fly back onto the land?
*  No, because they like to fly against the wind.
*  So I grip the bird.
*  Okay.
*  It's surprisingly light in my hands.
*  It almost feels like nothing.
*  It feels like I'm about to throw a Kleenex off this cliff.
*  Also, do we need to worry about these seagulls like eating him?
*  No, no, they don't go for the puppets.
*  And I get in position.
*  Should I do it?
*  Yeah, I think just give it the old college try and let's see what happens.
*  Okay.
*  One, two, three.
*  And...
*  The bird sails out beyond the cliff's edge.
*  It's flapping like a maniac, flapping its absolute brains out.
*  It looks like a hummingbird.
*  For a long, terrible moment, we watch our bird drifting backwards, struggling and losing altitude until, miraculously,
*  the puffling taps into some deep root of strength.
*  It somehow manages to gain one molecule of an advantage over the wind, and it goes zipping just slightly forward,
*  just barely missing the rock, and starts half flying, half falling down the cliff face,
*  then suddenly bursts out over the ocean into the clear.
*  This thing I just had in my hands, now we see it as this tiny dot heading toward the horizon,
*  silhouetted against one of these distant islands.
*  And when we finally lose sight of it, our bird is very, very close to the cliff.
*  It's like a little bird, and it's just like a little bird, and it's just like a little bird,
*  and when we finally lose sight of it, our bird is very, very, very far out to sea.
*  As we drive back down from the cliff, I am so happy.
*  I just can't stop thinking about how that little struggling creature we saved is now sailing out across the freezing water into this whole new life,
*  a life we can't even imagine. And we did that. We fixed that mistake. We literally saved its life.
*  I'm not sure I've saved anything's life before. I don't think I've been particularly helpful to anything before.
*  And now I'm like a superhero. This is all I want to do.
*  Got it? Yeah, got it.
*  Fortunately, holy crap, I did it.
*  Over the next couple of days, puffling season finally starts to pick up.
*  You're a handsome fella.
*  The babies are late, but they are here.
*  Do we have pufflings? Yes.
*  And we are catching one after another.
*  You're good at catching pufflings. Oh, thanks.
*  I make sure to give every puffling a name. Puffernutter.
*  Puff and stuff. Puff the magic dragon. Puffle puff.
*  Just want to make sure you're okay in there.
*  Okay, ready?
*  And then one by one. One, two, three.
*  Release them back to the sea. Yeah!
*  We did it!
*  Before long, I have fallen completely in love with this island and its birds and everything else about it.
*  One evening, I see the most spectacular sunset of my life.
*  And then I turn around and behind me, at the same time, there is a full rainbow arcing across the sky, ending in a volcano.
*  And then that same night, while we're out catching birds, we see the northern lights.
*  It's extremely green.
*  And you can see the little red and purple.
*  The sky is overflowing with stars.
*  It's very green. Very bright. That is very green.
*  Everyone back home hates me.
*  I text a bunch of breathtaking photos and my wife writes back, good for you.
*  And then she sends me a photo of the giant pile of boxes she's packed up to ship to our daughter's dorm room, which totally fair.
*  But you know what? I'm also very busy.
*  I have my own box to worry about.
*  And inside it, a little birdie who happens to have an appointment with one of the world's greatest authorities on puffins.
*  We'll meet him in just a minute after the break.
*  Dr. Erpor Snarr Hansen has been tracking the puffin population in Veseminaire for over a decade.
*  We meet him at a place downtown called the Puffin Rescue Center, where every puffling season, scientists weigh, measure and tag the baby birds.
*  And we hand him our perfect little puffling.
*  Let's have a look at your guy. Wait.
*  Right out of the gate. Whoa.
*  He's a bit of a downer.
*  Does he look smaller to you?
*  Yeah, you can grab it on him if you like it.
*  Dr. Hansen tells us that this year's pufflings were late, which was why it was so hard to find them at first.
*  And they're also dangerously small.
*  And even though our little bird is a little underweight.
*  So we can go and release your friend or you can do.
*  He offers to help us release it up near some cliffs where he's been conducting puffin research.
*  These cliffs are really steep.
*  Dr. Hansen takes us up a terrifyingly narrow little sheep trail.
*  The first puffin hunter he felt who was coming to the rescue was a young, young puffling hunter.
*  He was a young, young puffling hunter.
*  He was a young, young puffling hunter.
*  He was a young, young puffling hunter.
*  The first puffin hunter, he felt his death on that slope there down on the edge.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  But he doesn't seem worried at all about falling.
*  Have you ever fallen down?
*  No, I'm still alive.
*  I brought along a six pack of beer because it had puffins on the label.
*  Have a seat. Nothing like a beer in the field.
*  Okay, just wait a little.
*  They're flying really close, huh?
*  So close.
*  You think? I love it.
*  All around us there are adult puffins popping in and out of their burrows,
*  hopping around in the grass, flying in and out of the water,
*  swooping right over us with beaks full of tiny fish.
*  There's one. Yeah, just popped out.
*  God, they're so funny.
*  They work so hard to fly.
*  Yeah, they beat their wings by 10 hertz, I think.
*  And that's why their energy demands are so high.
*  It's so costly to fly. They fly like 70, 80 kilometers per hour at full speed.
*  See, they're bringing in food like crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Wow. Given their circumstances.
*  The circumstances, he tells us, are terrible.
*  He scribbles us this ridiculously complicated map with graphs all over it
*  showing, as far as I can understand it,
*  that basically climate change is changing sea temperatures
*  and shifting the ocean currents,
*  and so there are fewer fish around for puffins to eat.
*  This means that puffin parents have to work much harder to feed their babies,
*  and sometimes they can't feed them at all.
*  This year's pufflings are late, most likely because they're undernourished.
*  They're not ready to fly yet.
*  So what would happen to, let's say, this puffling?
*  Most likely it's not going to make it.
*  Why not?
*  It's just so way below the weight,
*  and we know the weight is highly linearly correlated with survival,
*  and it's most likely related to they don't have enough power to deal with bad weathers,
*  then they starve, and then they die.
*  Something like that, that kind of stuff.
*  Seems like a bad time to be a puffin.
*  No, it's a hard time.
*  So this is not a lot, normally.
*  Oh no, this is kind of sad, actually.
*  You're ruining my magical moment.
*  But they're here.
*  Dr. Hansen's ass is hurting, so we head down to the beach to release our bird.
*  You want to do it?
*  He doesn't want to throw this puffling, and I'm guessing he wouldn't name it either.
*  We named her Greta after my daughter.
*  Go be a man.
*  Probably a man, did you say?
*  No, I'd be a man.
*  All right, little girl.
*  All right, little Greta bird.
*  Ready?
*  One, two, three.
*  Three.
*  Greta the puffling flaps hard, and she glides out past the breakers into calmer waters,
*  where we see her land and float and start to swim away.
*  She did it.
*  So you think she'll survive?
*  Yeah, she has a chance.
*  I mean, she's what, 250, 255, right?
*  It's at the lower end, so she's more likely to perish than to live, if I have to make a nasty guess.
*  But you never know.
*  But you never know.
*  And that is the maddening thing about letting go.
*  You just have to stand there and watch your precious thing disappear into a future over which you have no control.
*  And you're left holding nothing but the terrifying lightness of your suddenly empty hands.
*  What a nice day.
*  Hi.
*  Hello.
*  Hello.
*  Hi again.
*  Svava of Stockholm.
*  Hi.
*  It's our last day on the island, and we stop by Tristi's house to say goodbye to our island family.
*  Sigi of Stockholm.
*  Sigi Stockholm.
*  I brought two puffin beers.
*  Svava and Sigi have just gotten off work and are relaxing in the garden.
*  I don't drink.
*  You don't drink?
*  You don't drink puffins?
*  I don't drink.
*  I eat puffins.
*  I don't drink.
*  The weather is perfect.
*  It feels more like California than Iceland.
*  And we sit here enjoying the sunshine, watching the sun slide down the sky until it touches the volcano.
*  Cheers to the puffin.
*  Over drinks and snacks, we reminisce about our week, about how I've started to think constantly about my own daughter leaving home, what it means to be a parent, and how hard it is to let go.
*  Svava has five kids, and all of them, except for Tristi, have already left home.
*  What has it been like for you, and do you have any advice for me?
*  Because I have many feelings about it.
*  When Kislevirige, our oldest boy, moved to Reykjavik, 17 years old, I was very, very depressed.
*  My heart was broken for two weeks, and then I have to start...
*  He is getting older.
*  He has to go to get out to the life just like we.
*  So you just have to feel the heartbreak.
*  Yes, for two weeks.
*  You live.
*  You know, when you have your child, when you have your child the first time, you know right away,
*  you don't own it.
*  You just have to take care of it and help them.
*  Do you have one kid?
*  No, she's our first, so we have a son who will be there for another few years.
*  Little pavlings.
*  Yes, yes.
*  But we are always mom and dad for the 42 years old boy.
*  I sometimes take him and...
*  I always said, you can change your mother if you don't like me.
*  Okay.
*  Would you like to have pancakes?
*  Do you have pancakes?
*  Yes, he wants pancakes.
*  I would love to have pancakes.
*  If you don't mind.
*  Thank you.
*  A coffee or...
*  Siggy sets the table with jams and syrups.
*  We have coffee and we eat way too many pancakes.
*  And then we say goodbye.
*  So maybe we will see each other again.
*  Yes, we will see each other again.
*  Very nice to have you.
*  Very nice to meet you. Thank you so much.
*  Morning.
*  In the next morning, with my bags packed, I board the ferry to leave this magical island
*  and go back to my family in New York.
*  I set up top on the deck because I've brought something from the island with me.
*  Do you have in the box?
*  Oh, it's a pavling.
*  Oh, sweet.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Yeah, we found him last night.
*  We rescued him.
*  Yeah, we're going to let it go once we get out to the ocean.
*  Tristy told me that releasing a pavling at sea was one of the best ways to send a baby bird out into its new life.
*  There's no cliffs, no cats, great chance of survival.
*  This is a good spot.
*  Yeah.
*  As we watch the island shrinking into the distance behind us, I take my last pavling out of its box.
*  Come here, buddy.
*  I raise the bird in my hand, I count to three, and one last time, I let go.

*  Puffling, puffling in the night.
*  Gliding, gliding towards the night.
*  Lost in the street, just by their way out.
*  Missing their seats, though they're all alone.
*  Sheltered, they sink in the dark in the corner.
*  Time to go and rescue them.
*  All of our friends are dead.
*  They're all alone.
*  Sheltered, they sink in the dark in the corner.
*  Time to go and rescue them.
*  Puffing in the Puffling.
*  Searching down in the darkness below for the puffling within my soul.
*  Searching down in the darkness below for the puffling within my soul.
*  I found the Puffling.
*  Look, I found the Puffling.
*  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
