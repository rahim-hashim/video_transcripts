# A Radical Reboot of Nuclear Energy
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v653JB0ROKU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Nuclear power, once the great hope for a clean way to meet the world's energy needs, fell
*  out of favor decades ago.
*  Today, my colleague Brad Plumer explains how one company with a radical idea is now working
*  to bring it back.
*  It's Monday, July 29th.
*  Brad, welcome to the show.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  So you cover climate, and you've been reporting on something that doesn't normally come to
*  mind when I think of climate change, and that's nuclear power.
*  It hasn't really been part of the conversation about how to fix climate change really at
*  all in recent years, but now you've found that that is changing.
*  Tell me about that.
*  Yeah, so there is a ton of innovation and a ton of investment pouring into nuclear power
*  And a big part of the reason for that is there's this growing sense among experts and policymakers
*  that in order to fight climate change, we really need a wide variety of clean energy
*  technologies.
*  Right now, we have solar power, we have wind power, those are growing incredibly fast and
*  really doing quite well, but they don't run all the time.
*  The sun's not always shining, the wind's not always blowing.
*  And so having something else like nuclear power that can run all the time would just
*  be incredibly valuable and might even be necessary if we want to solve climate change.
*  And that seems pretty important right now, right?
*  I mean, we've got these heat waves across the United States, storms feel more severe,
*  and wildfires are more and more destructive.
*  So finding new sources of clean energy is a pretty urgent task right now.
*  Exactly.
*  But also, in addition to fighting climate change, we just need a lot more electricity
*  in general.
*  There's this enormous growing demand for power from new data centers, from growing interest
*  in artificial intelligence, from electric cars, from all these new factories that are
*  popping up to build solar panels and batteries.
*  And so you have a lot of companies that are just urgently looking for clean energy sources
*  that can run 24 hours a day.
*  So to meet all of these needs right now, there's been a huge push by the US and other countries
*  to figure out how to make nuclear energy, which is emissions free, really a big part
*  of the solution.
*  But question, hasn't the nuclear power industry been around for a long time?
*  Yeah, it's a very well established technology that's been around since the 1950s.
*  But the history of using nuclear technology to make electricity has been pretty rocky.
*  It's had a lot of ups and downs.
*  And the country has really fallen both in and out of love with nuclear over time.
*  So when nuclear power was first developed in the 1950s and 60s, there were incredibly
*  high hopes for it.
*  Electricity, man's most versatile source of power.
*  And now man is using a powerful new source of electric power, the atom.
*  People saw it as this potentially unlimited cheap energy source.
*  Two ounces of uranium 235 can produce as much electrical energy as 800 carloads of
*  coal.
*  It's clean energy, no air pollution, powering electric cars.
*  There were interviews where officials were predicting that one day all new power plants
*  would be nuclear, just solving so many of the world's problems.
*  So already back then, they had this vision for fossil free future through nuclear.
*  Oh, absolutely.
*  The same atoms that send power surging from huge atomic power stations are also opening
*  new realms, which only the endurance of nuclear power can conquer.
*  By the end of the 1960s, you had more than 50 nuclear reactors under construction across
*  the United States.
*  And in the beginning, they were actually quite affordable.
*  But as more of these plants got built, people discovered different issues with them, flaws
*  that needed to be corrected, safety issues that need to be addressed with regulations.
*  And you had federal regulators, the agency that is now known as the Nuclear Regulatory
*  Commission, laying out new rules and safety standards and regulations for these plants.
*  Ray, I wanted to ask you about that, because when I think of arguments against nuclear,
*  I think that it's not safe.
*  That's the main obstacle.
*  So can you explain some of that thinking?
*  What are the safety issues here?
*  So with any nuclear plant, there really are potential risks to people and the environment.
*  Nuclear power plants create radiation that needs to be contained.
*  And if you have a big dose of radiation that leaks out into the environment, that can be
*  potentially very harmful to humans and nearby wildlife.
*  And then the plants also produce radioactive waste that takes a long time to decay and
*  needs to be safely stored for many hundreds of years.
*  The safety record for nuclear power has been extremely good in the United States, and that's
*  largely because the plants have a ton of safety features to contain radiation leaks.
*  And a lot of that has come because the plants are very strictly regulated.
*  So nuclear plants then are pretty safe, despite the risks.
*  So where did this public perception of danger come from then?
*  So the reality is no technology is ever going to be completely risk free.
*  There's always the potential for an accident.
*  And then you had this big shock event in 1979.
*  For many years, there has been a vigorous debate in this country about the safety of
*  the nation's 72 nuclear energy power plants.
*  That debate is likely to be intensified because of what happened early this morning at a nuclear
*  power plant in Pennsylvania.
*  A reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania partially melted down.
*  I heard a very loud noise that sounded like a huge release of steam.
*  I looked out the window.
*  It was geyser steam that was raising up in the air.
*  So that meltdown released some radioactive gases into the environment, which was really
*  concerning.
*  You had hundreds of thousands of people evacuate from the nearby area.
*  The radiation inside the plant is at eight times the deadly level, so strong that after
*  passing through a three foot thick concrete wall, it can be measured a mile away.
*  There were no deaths or big health effects that resulted from the meltdown.
*  The leak ended up being relatively small, but it was huge national news.
*  It's a lot worse than what they're telling us.
*  Typical wise, they had to close all those nuclear power plants down.
*  It really horrified a lot of people across the nation and it caused enormous disruptions
*  in the industry.
*  In a lot of ways, it was the beginning of the end of nuclear power in the United States
*  in the 20th century.
*  There were dozens of reactors still under construction at the time of Three Mile Island,
*  and suddenly they were all put on pause while regulators reviewed safety rules.
*  They put in place a bunch of new stricter regulations across the industry, everything
*  from training staff to upgrading piping systems and fire equipment.
*  Some projects ended up being delayed for 10 years, and the cost of building a nuclear
*  power plant really went through the roof after that accident.
*  In other words, after Three Mile Island, there was legitimately a concern about safety, and
*  the regulations just piled on, and that made building new plants prohibitively expensive.
*  That's right.
*  You get a couple different explanations for what happened there.
*  Some blame the industry for poorly managing projects, but you also get a lot of people
*  who say that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had piled on too many rules and driven up
*  the cost of nuclear power.
*  And you do get an argument about whether those regulations are reasonable.
*  You might say, look, nuclear power is inherently dangerous.
*  We should regulate it as strictly as possible.
*  There are others who point out that we have a bunch of different regulatory bodies in
*  the U.S., like the FDA, that looks at drugs, and they tend to weigh the benefits.
*  With the risks of new technology, a lot of critics of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
*  say that only focuses on the risks, and when you regulate like that, technologies can become
*  unaffordable.
*  Basically, utilities couldn't afford to take the financial risk of building a new plant
*  anymore.
*  They didn't know how long it would take, they didn't know how much it would cost, and they
*  were scared off.
*  Okay, so that explains how the hopes for nuclear power died.
*  The potential for danger became big enough that simply making these plants became too
*  expensive, too complicated, too unwieldy, and we basically stopped building them.
*  But as we talked about earlier, the need for clean energy has grown enormously since then.
*  So what is happening now?
*  What's the state of nuclear energy in the U.S. today?
*  So now what we're starting to see is a whole bunch of startups and companies going back
*  to the drawing board and completely rethinking nuclear power technology to try to make it
*  more affordable, to try to make it faster to build.
*  They're coming up with new ideas for nuclear power plants that are radically different
*  from what we've seen over the past 50 years.
*  And now, this summer, we're actually seeing the construction of the very first of these
*  plants in Wyoming.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Brad, you said that new companies are now trying to revive this nuclear industry
*  and update it for the present day, and that we're seeing that happening in Wyoming.
*  What's going on there?
*  So in southwest Wyoming, there's this coal town called Kemmerer.
*  Outside the town is this giant coal plant that's scheduled to close in the next 15 years.
*  And then just down the road, this startup called TerraPower has just begun construction
*  on a nuclear power plant in June, which is the only nuclear power plant currently under
*  construction in the United States.
*  Thanks so much for joining us all here today for the groundbreaking of America's next nuclear
*  power station, Kemmerer Unit 1.
*  So I went to the groundbreaking for this plant, and Chris Levesque, the CEO of TerraPower,
*  was there talking about how excited he was to finally start building this new plant.
*  Not only is this America's next reactor, it's the first advanced reactor in the free world.
*  And the man who started this company is Bill Gates.
*  I want to acknowledge the great work done by the TerraPower team, starting with Chris,
*  but it's kind of a dream, and here we are making it a reality.
*  So Bill Gates, who I think of as a public health guy, not really a nuclear power guy.
*  Why is Bill Gates involved in a nuclear power plant?
*  Yeah, Bill Gates has been interested for a long time in trying to figure out how to solve
*  climate change.
*  And at this groundbreaking, he told the story of how his interest in nuclear power got started.
*  It was around 2005 when I was talking to some physics friends of mine about the need for
*  electricity, and really trying to understand from them why nuclear power had gotten so expensive.
*  And he said he was talking to his scientist friends who explained how the economics of
*  nuclear power just weren't working, basically for all the reasons we talked about earlier.
*  And they talked to me about how if you started anew and were willing to embrace innovation,
*  you could build something that was both safer and cheaper.
*  And so we started a company with a very bold idea to revolutionize nuclear power.
*  So that inspired Gates to start TerraPower around 2008.
*  He hired a team of hundreds of engineers to redesign a nuclear power plant from scratch,
*  because he believed that technology was the key to the country's growing energy needs.
*  So here we are, standing on what will soon be the breadrock of America's energy future.
*  And I can't wait to be here when we turn the reactor on.
*  Thank you.
*  Okay, so what do they come up with?
*  So I'll try not to get too technical here.
*  But most nuclear power plants today basically use the atomic fission to heat up a bunch
*  of water and create steam to generate electricity.
*  They're basically giant kettles.
*  But the problem with that is because the water is highly pressurized, these plants often
*  need heavy piping, thick containment shields to protect against things like steam explosions
*  and other accidents.
*  And that makes them very complex and very expensive.
*  So TerraPower decided that instead of using water to use liquid sodium, salt basically
*  that's heated up.
*  And the advantage of that is that it operates at lower pressures.
*  And in theory, you don't need a lot of the same heavy components, the thick shields,
*  other safety features that traditional light water reactors need.
*  And what's the advantage of that, Brad?
*  So the idea is if you don't have as many components, it should be cheaper in the long run.
*  They're making smaller plants so that you're not investing as much money up front and the
*  risk is not quite as big.
*  And how much approximately would it cost to build one of these things?
*  Right now they're estimating that the initial plant will cost around $4 billion.
*  Now I talked to a lot of people who expect that to rise a lot as they struggle with novel
*  technology.
*  But their hope is that eventually that they can provide nuclear power for around half
*  the cost of traditional nuclear power plants.
*  Wow, half the cost.
*  But the plant is smaller, right?
*  So does that mean this smaller, cheaper plant actually produces less energy?
*  It produces a lot less energy than the traditional big plants.
*  But the hope is that you build a bunch of these and eventually you get better at building
*  these over time and the costs come down.
*  And their dream scenario is in the 2030s and the 2040s, the country has a pretty potent
*  source of clean energy that can supplement all the wind and solar power that we're building
*  now.
*  But building that first plant is a gamble.
*  They've never done it before.
*  Things could go wrong.
*  It could be more expensive than they thought.
*  But one thing that's unique about TerraPower is that they have Bill Gates behind them,
*  one of the world's wealthiest men, and he can afford to take that gamble on the first
*  few plants.
*  Right.
*  You can afford to lose $2 billion if you're Bill Gates, right?
*  That is more or less what he said.
*  So for this first plant, he's already invested more than a billion dollars of his own money
*  into it.
*  The Department of Energy has pledged up to about $2 billion.
*  And then there are other private investors.
*  But what he said is he has pledged to stick with the project, even if it goes over budget,
*  as they work through some initial growing pains.
*  And that's pretty unique.
*  There are a lot of electric utilities and power companies out there that have said,
*  we'd love to have a nuclear power plant once you've figured out the technology and bring
*  the costs down.
*  But we don't want to be the first one to do it.
*  Right.
*  They don't want to be the first one in line in the bungee jump, right?
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  So this company has the vision.
*  It has the money.
*  It's already started working toward making all of this a reality.
*  You saw Bill Gates out there with a shovel in Wyoming.
*  What's the likelihood that this will actually work?
*  So they have to prove that they can build this plant.
*  And it's going to be tough.
*  There are a huge number of obstacles they face that are pretty daunting.
*  The plant won't be finished until 2030 at the very earliest.
*  And a lot of people I talked to thought even that might be optimistic.
*  One big hurdle they face is that their reactor uses this specialized type of enriched uranium
*  fuel that currently only Russia makes.
*  And that's a big problem.
*  Right.
*  After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Terra Power said, OK, we're not going to buy our
*  fuel from Russia.
*  We need to get somewhere else.
*  Congress has stepped in and basically approved billions of dollars to build up a domestic
*  nuclear fuel supply chain.
*  But that's going to take time.
*  But that's a very significant hurdle.
*  I mean, years to build up our own supply chain.
*  It's very significant.
*  And it's a potential risk for the plant.
*  And maybe a bigger issue right now is that at the moment, their plant hasn't been fully
*  approved by the regulators, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
*  They've submitted an application.
*  They can basically start building all of the parts of the plant around the nuclear
*  reactor where the atomic fission occurs.
*  But they can't start construction on the reactor itself yet.
*  That approval will take at least two years and possibly longer.
*  And that's a big risk for them.
*  Is that a deal breaker?
*  So the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has told me that they have received the application
*  and they are very eager to show that they can approve new nuclear technology.
*  But the catch is that for five decades, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has largely
*  overseen those old light water reactors.
*  That's the technology they're most familiar with.
*  That's what they're comfortable with.
*  So now they suddenly have to get comfortable with a brand new technology and ensure that
*  it's safe.
*  That sounds like it's going to take a long time.
*  It could take a while.
*  And TerraPower has to convince regulators that their plant doesn't necessarily need
*  the same expensive safety equipment that other reactors have.
*  The theory behind them is that these reactors should be inherently safer and don't require
*  as many costly components and safety features.
*  But there are definitely some people worried that regulators may be too inflexible and
*  may not be up to the task.
*  Okay, so this is hard.
*  There are a lot of obstacles.
*  Is there anywhere where these kinds of nuclear reactors are actually up and running?
*  So no one's trying to build a reactor exactly like TerraPower's.
*  But right now, Russia and China are building a large number of nuclear reactors.
*  And they're also building some advanced models that they hope they can export around the
*  world.
*  China right now is building at least 23 nuclear reactors.
*  We have one, this one in Wyoming.
*  So a lot of US officials really think of this as a race because they don't want to see China
*  and Russia exporting their nuclear technology around the world, establishing these long-term
*  relationships with other countries and becoming the dominant suppliers of the technology that
*  the United States invented in the first place.
*  In fact, Congress has been putting a lot of pressure on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
*  They have basically been saying, we want these new advanced reactors, you need to get these
*  approved in a timely fashion.
*  So everyone's watching to see how this process goes.
*  So, Brett, if we look at the big picture of what's going on right now, I wonder if the
*  urgency of the climate crisis, you know, just how acute it's become, is going to change
*  how we think about the risk-benefit analysis of nuclear power, you know, the one that we
*  were talking about before.
*  Like do the tight regulations that made a lot of sense in the 1980s and the 1990s, we
*  put them in place for some very good reasons.
*  Do those now make less sense because of the real pickle that we find ourselves in climate-wise?
*  So there's always going to be demand for pretty strict regulations around nuclear power, just
*  because there are real risks involved.
*  But I think what we've started to see in Washington is both Republicans and Democrats start to
*  rethink whether we've struck the right balance.
*  In June, we saw Congress, with big bipartisan majorities, pass a bill aimed at reforming
*  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline approvals of new reactor designs, to increase
*  staffing at the agency.
*  But also there was a pretty striking provision in that bill that basically told the NRC to
*  consider not just the safety of reactors, but also the benefits of nuclear energy technology
*  to society.
*  And the idea is that we should really weigh the risks against the benefits of nuclear power.
*  You know, there are a lot of challenges to building nuclear power.
*  There are technical obstacles, there are financial obstacles.
*  But if nuclear power is going to make a comeback, it will probably require a big shift in how
*  people view the technology and how they weigh the risks of the technology.
*  And I think we're starting to see that shift.
*  Brad, thank you.
*  Thank you so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Sunday, diplomats scrambled to contain hostilities between Israel and Lebanon.
*  After Israel's military coup, the United States and the United States signed a deal
*  after Israeli forces hit Lebanon with multiple strikes overnight in response to a deadly
*  rocket attack on Thursday that hit a soccer field in an Israeli-controlled town.
*  Israel blamed Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese group, for the attack on the Druze
*  Arab town of Mashd al-Shamz, which killed 12 people, most of them children.
*  It was the deadliest assault on Israeli-controlled territory since Israel and Hezbollah began
*  exchanging missile and rocket fire in October.
*  The Israeli response appeared to stop short of a major escalation, but there were still
*  fears that the fallout from the rocket launch would lead to all-out war.
*  And...
*  And the flame has been lit for the Paris Games.
*  On Friday, the 33rd Olympic Games kicked off in Paris.
*  Hundreds of thousands of spectators braved heavy downpours to line the banks of the
*  River Seine for the first opening ceremony to take place outside of a stadium.
*  As the competition got underway...
*  The first for Team USA in Paris.
*  The U.S. scored its first Olympic gold in swimming for the men's relay.
*  McIntosh takes the silver and Ledecky gets the bronze.
*  Swimmer Katie Ledecky scored her first medal in the 400-meter freestyle.
