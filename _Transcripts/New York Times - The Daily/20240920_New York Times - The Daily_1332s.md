# Six Weeks to Go
**New York Times Podcasts:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyDQljEr_3g)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  The race for the White House has kicked into overdrive tonight with attacks.
*  As the presidential race enters its final 45 days.
*  It's good to be back in Pennsylvania.
*  Hello, Pennsylvania.
*  How are we doing, Pennsylvania?
*  We assemble a campaign roundtable with my colleagues from the politics desk.
*  Today, Maggie Haberman, Shane Goldmacher and Nate Kohn make sense of the week's biggest
*  developments.
*  The Federal Reserve cut interest rates today for the first time in four years.
*  The Democrats have always taken for granted that they're going to get our vote no matter
*  what.
*  And the Republicans fancy themselves as the working people's party.
*  Former President Trump has now faced two apparent assassination attempts.
*  It's Friday, September 20th.
*  Maggie, Shane, Nate.
*  Thank you all for doing this.
*  Thank you for having us.
*  Thank you.
*  Yeah.
*  So just to explain what we're doing here.
*  It feels like we've reached the point in this campaign where the news is coming at us so
*  fast that our normal format of telling one story a day is not quite keeping up.
*  And so to meet this moment, we've recruited you three to come kind of walk us through
*  the thicket that is the news at this phase of the race.
*  So it's an experiment for us.
*  We invented something.
*  It's brand new.
*  It's called the political roundtable.
*  Congratulations.
*  Wow.
*  What an honor to be part of the first.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Inaugural.
*  The first of any kind.
*  Yeah.
*  No, ever, ever, ever.
*  Yes, in history.
*  So let's start with a very big new poll co-conducted by the New York Times that came out just a
*  few hours ago.
*  Could each of you just tell me what you took from this poll?
*  I think that this is a poll.
*  There's actually two polls and there's some contradiction between the two of them.
*  The first poll is a national poll and it shows a tied race, which isn't really a surprise.
*  And it shows no movement basically since the debate a week ago, even though voters overwhelmingly
*  said that Kamala Harris performed really, really well.
*  So that's the first part of the poll.
*  Is that worth lingering on that people told us in this poll Kamala Harris did great?
*  It had been our understanding that if she did great, she'd get a bump in the polls.
*  Nationally, she doesn't.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's definitely worth lingering on.
*  The fact is that overwhelmingly, voters said she did really well.
*  Something close to 70% of voters said she performed well in this debate, far more than
*  the 40% who said the same of Trump.
*  That means a big chunk of people who said she did well are not voting for her.
*  But that's also part of the story, which is that she might have done better in the debate,
*  but it didn't actually change how people said they were planning to vote in the head to
*  head match up with Donald Trump.
*  And it wasn't just on that top line, who are you going to vote for?
*  It was on a whole suite of issues.
*  Who do you think is better on the economy, on immigration, on abortion, on democracy?
*  All of these issues were essentially unchanged by this debate that was watched by 67 million
*  Americans, the most who watched anything since the Super Bowl, and yet no difference in the
*  head to head.
*  Why not, Nate?
*  Well, it's a pretty polarized country and the number of undecided voters did tick down
*  from our previous poll to this one.
*  So a lot of voters are making up their minds and they're mostly falling into the place
*  where they were before.
*  This is a match up that neatly divides voters in a lot of ways.
*  We have a populist, older white conservative against a younger black and South Asian woman
*  from California who has liberal views on all the issues.
*  So there's room for someone to be torn between these two options.
*  But as far as choices go, this is a relatively clear one.
*  Okay, but this poll did something else, which was it told us about how Kamala Harris is
*  doing in the very specific, crucial state, Maggie, of Pennsylvania.
*  What do you take from that result?
*  What's striking and as Shane said is it's contradictory to what we saw in the national
*  poll where they're tied.
*  She's up.
*  It's 50 to 46.
*  In Pennsylvania.
*  In Pennsylvania.
*  And one of the reasons that might be is the Democrats have done relatively better with
*  white voters this cycle than in previous cycles.
*  And Pennsylvania is a particularly white state compared to the rest of the country.
*  And so if you look at how Joe Biden did with white voters in 2020, it was slightly less.
*  Hillary Clinton, substantially less.
*  And so if she has made some modest gains there, that could be why.
*  Does that feel right to you, Nate?
*  Because I think my inclination would be to think that if Kamala Harris is tied with Trump
*  I would not expect her to be doing better in a swing state where I would just imagine
*  demographically things might be stacked a little bit against her.
*  Look, I wouldn't expect it either.
*  And you know, they are polls.
*  They're subject to a margin of error.
*  It's possible that if we did the polls again that they would come a little closer.
*  But this doesn't come from nowhere.
*  In the 2022 midterm, Democrats swept the key Senate races, including winning Pennsylvania
*  by five points, even while Republicans won the House popular vote.
*  So there could be a change from the last election.
*  It could be not all the way to this poll result where Harris does four points better in Pennsylvania
*  than she does nationwide, but one where the gap between the key battleground states and
*  the electoral college is a little smaller than we're used to.
*  I was just going to say, I mean, there's like two stories you can tell about the race right
*  now that I think that these polls capture.
*  And we talk about how polls are a snapshot.
*  This snapshot shows a really close race nationally and maybe a slight edge for Kamala
*  Harris, not just in Pennsylvania, but looking at other polls across those key battlegrounds
*  around the Great Lakes.
*  So how do you get the story of what that means next?
*  And it's not at all clear to me what it means next, because we got here and it's look, Kamala
*  Harris just had an incredible two months, right?
*  She's gotten almost exclusively positive reviews and coverage.
*  She had a strong debate.
*  Her favorability rating in Pennsylvania is above 50 percent.
*  All these things are going in her favor.
*  And yet you get all of that and she's tied and just maybe marginally ahead in these really,
*  really important states.
*  It's not just that she's had a great series of weeks, although she absolutely has.
*  Trump's had a terrible series of days.
*  Trump had a debate in which he was spreading a baseless claim that Haitian immigrants in
*  Springfield, Ohio are eating pets.
*  And doubling down on that ever since, he posted inexplicably on truth social, I hate Taylor
*  Swift, who is an incredibly popular figure.
*  Yeah, a lot of people don't hate her.
*  A lot of people don't hate her.
*  And now he has done any number of self-destructive things while also facing one clear assassination
*  attempt, one apparent assassination attempt.
*  Normally speaking, a politician would get some measure of sympathy or voters feeling
*  sorry for them or feeling more open to them.
*  And because of Trump's own behavior, he just does not.
*  OK, are you guys a little bit reigning on Kamala Harris's Pennsylvania parade?
*  Because I'm hearing, if I'm reading between the lines, you all say she's up in Pennsylvania,
*  but not that much.
*  And after a really great run and Maggie, you're saying Trump's had a rough couple of days
*  So she could be up even more.
*  I think the poll shows that a lot of the vulnerabilities that we've talked about before are still
*  there for Kamala Harris.
*  In the last episode that I was with you on, we noted that more voters thought Harris was
*  more of the same rather than change.
*  And Harris has tried to pitch herself as a new generation of political leadership that
*  can take the country in a new direction.
*  But the poll still finds, even in Pennsylvania, that most voters think she's more of the same.
*  And most voters think Donald Trump is change.
*  And to me, that just shows that she is swimming a little bit upstream in this election.
*  One related issue here that may be another reason to rain a bit on Harris's parade is
*  that Harris's strength in this poll comes out of white college graduates.
*  She's still doing really poorly among white working class voters, just as badly as Joe
*  Biden did or worse than Joe Biden four years ago, both in Pennsylvania and nationwide.
*  White college graduates, that's a different story.
*  Now, they're somewhat insulated from the economy.
*  They may have the disposable income to survive rising prices.
*  But it's also, to me, a possible indication that maybe we're talking about a lot of overeager
*  Democratic voters who are looking to pick up the phone right now after a debate and
*  after a month where Harris fared really well.
*  And that perhaps might explain why she's doing well in Pennsylvania, a state I think of as
*  being very working class, having a lot of voters who didn't go to college.
*  That's right.
*  OK.
*  Something happened right before this poll, and that's that the Fed lowered the interest
*  rate, something we've been waiting for and talking about for a really long time.
*  In theory, that should make certain prices, especially the price of a 30 year fixed rate
*  mortgage, start to come down.
*  When it comes to the economy and how voters view these two candidates, is that too little
*  too late if you're Kamala Harris?
*  Is that a frustrating bit of timing for Donald Trump or does it not much matter at all?
*  I mean, Donald Trump was complaining about it as political yesterday, so it tells you
*  how he sees it.
*  He's clearly frustrated and thinks that it might help Democrats.
*  And could it help Harris?
*  Sure, it could help Harris.
*  But I think you are going to see Trump and Republicans claim that this was some form
*  of interference by Democrats.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that the interest rates lead to changes in some of the few economic
*  numbers that people experience in their life.
*  This is the kind of thing that it juices the economy in a way that people don't see immediately,
*  but it can change how people feel.
*  I think it's going to take a bit of time.
*  In Pennsylvania, only 22 percent of voters thought the economy was excellent or good
*  in this survey.
*  There's a lot of ground to make up here before the economy starts being anything like an
*  advantage for Harris.
*  Voters have believed for years that the economy was bad.
*  I don't know that they're going to change their views on this very quickly.
*  I think we're going to go take an ad break.
*  Do you want to give it to us?
*  We'll be right back.
*  All right, let's turn to our next piece of business here, which is news of something
*  that kind of sounds like not news because it's the non-endorsement from a very big
*  union in the U.S. with 1.3 million members in the transportation industry.
*  So tell us that story.
*  Sure.
*  The National Brotherhood of Teamsters, they are in a variety of states across the country,
*  hugely influential for 30 years endorsed Democrats.
*  This year, Sean O'Brien, the head of the Teamsters, for his own personal internal political reasons,
*  started flirting with Donald Trump as a possible endorsement.
*  Why?
*  He went to Mar-a-Lago to meet with him.
*  A lot of his members are in southern states and they are more Republican leaning and he
*  to them and show that he is not just going in one political direction.
*  So it is not a surprise that he spoke, say, at the Republican National Convention because
*  he had been drifting toward Donald Trump.
*  Now, his advisors said that he asked to speak at both party conventions.
*  The Democrats, after he spoke at the Republican Convention, did not have him.
*  And he gave a pretty aggressive anti-corporate speech at that convention.
*  Right, I was in the room.
*  But nonetheless, it was seen as a boost to Donald Trump because it tied him to organized
*  labor.
*  And working class voters.
*  He was a proxy for working class voters.
*  And working class voters.
*  And the union has now decided not to endorse this cycle.
*  This is at minimum a harm to Harris and it is helpful to Trump to be able to say, as
*  he has been for the last day, rank and file members support me.
*  Now he said that on Long Island where the local Teamsters affiliate had actually endorsed
*  Harris.
*  But it doesn't matter.
*  It gives Trump a talking point and that's the strategy here.
*  They didn't exactly peel off the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, but they did get
*  neutral and that's good enough for them.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a reflection of the shifting voting patterns of union members.
*  This is union leadership reflecting union members, which is in some of these trade workers,
*  they are increasingly been for Trump, right?
*  They released some of their own internal surveys about where they were.
*  Even in when Biden was in the race, there was a big chunk in favor, right?
*  So if you look at union leadership across the country, it's almost universally for Democrats.
*  This is an exception.
*  The exception is a non endorsement, right?
*  Most are not going anywhere near Trump.
*  But it's a reflection that the membership has shifted on these issues.
*  And again, for Trump, that's a win.
*  He wants to be making inroads with those voters and he wants people to have a pass that it's
*  okay to consider him.
*  And I think that that's what helps.
*  It's also a positive for Harris that a person who spoke at the Republican National Convention
*  didn't go all the way to endorsing Trump, right?
*  Right.
*  Nate, why does it matter that the Teamsters union has, in effect, de facto, kind of signaled
*  an affinity for Trump and not given the Democrats what they may have viewed as their kind of
*  birthright, which was the endorsement of such a powerful, longtime Democratic leaning union?
*  I want to go back to something Shane said, which is that the Teamsters conducted their
*  own surveys of their members.
*  And previously they found that most of their members backed Biden, only narrowly.
*  Now they find their members back Trump over Harris by a wide margin.
*  Now, not all of these surveys are scientific.
*  Some of them attempt to be, others are just a straw poll.
*  But this is part of a larger pattern that we see in our data, which is a further decline
*  in Democratic support among white working class voters since Harris became the nominee.
*  And a group like the Teamsters is suddenly up for grabs.
*  Hmm.
*  This is something of a sharp turn, but I think we do need to talk about the fallout from
*  what happened five days ago.
*  It feels like it's a lot longer than that.
*  And that is this second plot to try to kill Donald Trump.
*  And so I want to ask you all to help us think through what this second attempt means for
*  Trump and what it means for the electorate, because we're really dealing with something
*  truly unprecedented.
*  I mean, I remember seeing the first statement that Kamala Harris put out, which is that
*  violence has no place in this country.
*  And it just made me think that I'm not sure that's true anymore, that there is increasingly
*  a place where violence is in our country and in our politics.
*  And when you go back and think through all the different people who are political leaders
*  who have been subjected to violence recently, it's a long list.
*  And of course, we had the violence on January 6th.
*  And so these are horrific things.
*  And they're a reminder that this country isn't that far from violence anymore.
*  Maggie, what's your sense of how Trump personally is handling the fact that two people seem
*  to want to try to kill him in the past two months?
*  How is that affecting him based on your point?
*  Is it affecting him?
*  It's an interesting question, Michael.
*  We got a bit of an answer at the rally on Long Island on Wednesday night.
*  So after the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump was clearly in shock and lots of people
*  around him described him that way.
*  And I think he probably still is to some extent.
*  After what happened on Sunday in West Palm Beach, people who talked to him that afternoon
*  and saw him that afternoon said it was as if nothing had happened, that he just basically
*  resumed life.
*  It just became more grist for his storytelling.
*  But he wasn't stuck on it the same way and he wasn't processing it the same way.
*  And yet, at his rally, in the middle of an answer about, I don't even remember what,
*  I think it was tax policy or economic policy, you can see on the live stream, if listeners
*  were to watch it, his eyes flicker to his right and he sees someone moving.
*  And he sort of startles and he says to the crowd that he thought, essentially I'm paraphrasing,
*  but he thought somebody was coming up, meaning coming up on stage.
*  And he said, I thought that I was going to have to get ready to fight.
*  And then jokingly says that he's got a bit of a YIP problem.
*  Just translate that.
*  He means anxiety, YIP anxiety.
*  And he's...
*  How could you not be constantly looking over your shoulder?
*  100% as any normal person would do.
*  But when have we ever heard Donald Trump say something like that?
*  Right, a vulnerability expression is not his natural state.
*  It's not his natural state at all.
*  And so to hear him vocalize that and to see it in real time was pretty striking.
*  There was a moment in the 2016 campaign where someone rushed to the stage when he was speaking.
*  I remember that.
*  You remember that?
*  He sort of ducked.
*  That was his impulse.
*  That was the only time I've ever seen anything close.
*  This was really somebody who is on high alert right now.
*  And so even if he is not saying, yes, I'm worried.
*  Yes, this is scary, because he will never say something like that, he clearly is and
*  is clearly experiencing it.
*  Very understandably.
*  Nate, when we think about these back to back plots, how do you try to assess the way voters
*  think about it?
*  I don't think we have asked people in polls about this, but just knowing what you know
*  about how the electorate processes things, what are you thinking?
*  We haven't asked a single question about it to your point.
*  And what would we ask really if you think about it?
*  But if you step back for a second, take the long view of Donald Trump's political career.
*  Donald Trump today is more popular than he has ever been before.
*  Back in 2016, voters disliked him by nearly a two to one margin.
*  This year, it's much closer to 50-50 because almost all of the people who support him today
*  have gotten behind him.
*  And I wouldn't rule out a role for these assassination attempts in that process.
*  Consider this.
*  In the nine national polls that we took this cycle before his assassination attempt, between
*  21% and 24% of voters said they had a very favorable view of him.
*  Since the assassination attempt, the numbers are 31, 27, 30.
*  So there has been a big step up in the proportion of voters who say they have a very favorable
*  view of him.
*  Those reluctant Trump supporters over the years, a lot more of them are less reluctant.
*  And then there's an overall increase in favorability as well, where now he's consistently in the
*  upper 40s, something we had never seen in the course of his time as a major figure in
*  national political life.
*  I mean, Nate, you've touched just on something that I think is really interesting about what
*  my expectations were for how this election was going to go, not just because it was originally
*  going to be Trump and Biden, but it was going to be two deeply unpopular people that the
*  American people did not want to send to the White House.
*  And that's just not what the polling is showing anymore.
*  It shows with all the attack ads running against Kamala Harris that she is more popular than
*  she's been before.
*  And Donald Trump is more popular than he's been before.
*  You have two people in the upper 40s, sometimes tipping at 50%.
*  That's really popular right now in this country.
*  Like we've had people in the 30s, in the 40s.
*  So we actually have a shifting dynamic of what voters are thinking about these choices.
*  They don't dislike these choices nearly as much as we expected a few months ago.
*  That's very true.
*  2024 was beginning to look like a replay of 2016, where there were these two deeply
*  disliked candidates and it was going to be whoever was less disliked ended up winning.
*  That's still usually how elections work.
*  But if there is an election that could scramble that, it could be this one.
*  Well, guys, that's it.
*  Wow, a historic first of a roundtable on America.
*  That was fun.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  Thanks for having us.
*  You know, when they set up the exhibit in the Museum of Media History, I'm going to
*  be really proud to be in that photograph.
*  Thank you for having us.
*  This was fun.
*  Thank you, Nate, Maggie, Shane.
*  Appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks, Michael.
*  Let's do it again.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  On Thursday, the leader of Hezbollah accused Israel of breaking, quote, all conventions
*  and laws by blowing up thousands of handheld devices belonging to Hezbollah fighters over
*  the past two days and vowed to seek revenge.
*  As he spoke, Israeli fighter jets flew overhead, producing large sonic booms and shooting off
*  flares in an apparent show of Israeli force.
*  So far, the attacks have killed 37 people, most of them in the second wave of explosions
*  targeting walkie talkies.
*  To prevent further deaths, the Lebanese army is now carrying out controlled explosions
*  of electronic devices across the country.
*  Today's episode was produced by Diana Nguyen and Nina Feldman.
*  It was edited by Rachel Quester with help from Paige Cowitt, contains original music
*  by Pat McCusker, Alisha Baitoop and Dan Powell, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Lansferk of Wonderly.
*  Remember, you can catch a new episode of the interview right here tomorrow.
*  David Marchese talks with the Irish writer Sally Rooney, who's written a new novel called
*  Inter Mezzo.
*  One of the things that I find difficult to accept is that I only get one life.
*  That's the it.
*  I'm just me and I can never be anyone else.
*  And in a way, being a novelist allows me to get around that problem.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Michael Bobarro.
*  See you on Monday.
