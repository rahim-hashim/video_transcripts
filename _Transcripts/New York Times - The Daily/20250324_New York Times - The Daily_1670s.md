# Trump’s Escalating War With Higher Education
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=4.08s)]
*  In recent weeks, the Trump administration has put the American university system on [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=11.52s)]
*  notice. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=16.48s)]
*  It's pressed for changes, launched investigations, and in some cases, it's even withheld critical [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=17.48s)]
*  funds. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  Today, my colleague Ellen Blinder on how schools are responding to all of this pressure and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=25.12s)]
*  what it might mean for the future of higher education. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=31.68s)]
*  It's Monday, March 24th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=48.0s)]
*  Ellen, thank you so much for being with us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=55.28s)]
*  I am not surprised given the news cycle recently and how much we've been hearing about universities [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=57.36s)]
*  that you're working on a Sunday. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=62.36s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=64.32s)]
*  It really feels like we cannot go more than a few days without hearing about this escalating [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=65.6s)]
*  conflict between the Trump administration and the country's colleges and universities. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=70.86s)]
*  And you, Ellen, have been covering higher education for a really long time, so we thought [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=75.86s)]
*  you'd be the right person to sit down with so that you could kind of break all of this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  down for us. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=83.68s)]
*  But I think the first thing I want to do is just get a sense from you of whether you've [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  ever seen anything like this showdown that we are currently seeing between the higher [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=89.88s)]
*  education in this country and the White House. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=95.28s)]
*  I haven't seen anything like it, but more to the point, a lot of the sources I talk [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=99.08s)]
*  to, a lot of presidents and chancellors and provosts, people who have been in and around [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=102.98s)]
*  higher education for decades, haven't seen anything like it either. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=107.92s)]
*  They're almost shell shocked about what's happening. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=111.44000000000001s)]
*  It's been this wave of campaigns against higher education. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=114.72s)]
*  It's been this wave of complicating factors that may or may not have to do with universities [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  themselves. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  And in the end, you've got this real mess for higher education at this point that has [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  left a lot of the country's most elite universities, but also schools that are less prominent on [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=132.32s)]
*  defense. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=138.8s)]
*  And within all of that, it feels like your reporting has really focused on Columbia University [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=140.28s)]
*  for good reason. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=143.96s)]
*  Columbia has been a poster child for a lot of this conflict and a little bit of a case [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=144.96s)]
*  study, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=149.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=150.96s)]
*  I mean, look, it's been a very long year and a half or so for a lot of higher education, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=152.24s)]
*  but you will not find many universities in this country that have had a longer year and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=158.28s)]
*  a half than Columbia. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=162.48s)]
*  It has absolutely morphed into being a poster child for crackdowns and protests and really [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=164.56s)]
*  bitter disputes about what a university can and should be. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=172.08s)]
*  And that's really been coming home to roost these last couple of weeks. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=176.96s)]
*  Let's dive into Columbia a little bit more. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=181.16s)]
*  Can you just walk us through what's been happening there? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=182.66s)]
*  Well, Columbia has really been one of the biggest hubs of campus protest since the war [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=185.24s)]
*  in Gaza erupted and since the Hamas attack on Israel in October of 23. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=191.84s)]
*  Columbia had one of the most prolific encampments last spring. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=196.4s)]
*  Its university president at the time went to Capitol Hill, had a pretty roundly criticized [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=200.76s)]
*  appearance there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=205.28s)]
*  And what was interesting about Columbia is that a lot of people thought the university [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=206.28s)]
*  was getting it wrong. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=210.4s)]
*  It wasn't just one side of the other that thought the university was blowing it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=211.4s)]
*  And so as time has gone on, Columbia has really been a synonym for college chaos essentially [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=215.22s)]
*  over the last year and a half. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=222.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=223.66s)]
*  And that chaos has caused a lot of people on all sides to say that the university, as you [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=224.66s)]
*  put it, is blowing it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=229.52s)]
*  Can you just describe a little bit, what do they mean by blowing it exactly? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=230.86s)]
*  Well the left felt that Columbia was essentially becoming a police state and that it was being [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=235.9s)]
*  far too aggressive in tamping down on protest, on looking to restrict academic freedom. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=241.38s)]
*  They essentially saw a university that was crumpling under pressure from the right wing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=248.14s)]
*  The right had plenty of complaints of its own. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=255.38s)]
*  The right was mostly concerned that Columbia had descended into becoming this hot house [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=258.36s)]
*  of anti-Semitism, that it had allowed campus protest to just run amok and make one of the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=263.54s)]
*  country's most prominent universities this kind of lawless environment. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=269.94s)]
*  And that has been a drum that Republicans have been beating at this point for many, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=274.86s)]
*  many months. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=279.58000000000004s)]
*  And it's when President Trump and his allies were happy to jump on during the campaign [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  and then as soon as they returned to power in January. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=285.62s)]
*  And when they returned to power, what were they saying about universities? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=289.1s)]
*  It's very clear from the get-go that rooting out anti-Semitism on campuses is now going [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=292.62s)]
*  to go from being a campaign talking point to a real focus of the federal government. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=298.3s)]
*  So we start seeing executive orders and decisions that really start to shape how this is all [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=303.21999999999997s)]
*  going to play out. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  One of the most important things we saw was this idea that the Department of Justice was [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=309.38s)]
*  started investigating and visiting 10 universities that they saw as really having a lot of problems [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=315.02s)]
*  with anti-Semitism in their view. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=322.34s)]
*  Columbia was on the list. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=324.96s)]
*  And what are these investigations? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=326.02s)]
*  Tell us about those. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=327.46s)]
*  Well, they got a whole range of investigations. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=328.46s)]
*  There's this Department of Justice investigation that looks at whether Columbia and other schools [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=331.7s)]
*  were essentially allowing anti-Semitism to take hold and it was unlawful discrimination. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=337.38s)]
*  You've got an investigation from the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights that's [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=343.34s)]
*  looking at the same types of things. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=346.82s)]
*  You've got investigators from the Department of Health and Human Services talking about [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=349.02s)]
*  universities. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=354.14s)]
*  And it's coming from everywhere. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=355.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they are covering the waterfront on just about everything you can imagine. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=356.58s)]
*  And Columbia was an easy target. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=360.65999999999997s)]
*  So these investigations tend to take a very long time, but it becomes very clear very [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=364.14s)]
*  quickly that the federal government is going to be moving at really warp speed when it [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=368.94s)]
*  comes to these universities. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  And on March 7th, the government tells Columbia that it's going to withhold about $400 million [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=376.38s)]
*  in grants and contracts to the university. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=381.58s)]
*  $400 million sounds like a ton of money, but how much does that actually matter for [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=386.14s)]
*  Columbia, which is obviously an enormous institution? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=392.38s)]
*  So a $400 million cut would be a lot at any college or university in this country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  But Columbia, to put it in perspective, has like $6.6 billion in annual revenues and government [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  grants and contracts make up about 20% of its revenue. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=409.5s)]
*  So when the word came down from Washington about this $400 million cut, Columbia's interim [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=413.66s)]
*  president, she's a doctor named Katrina Armstrong, she said a cut of this size would be felt [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=419.62s)]
*  pretty much all over the campus. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=425.94000000000005s)]
*  It wouldn't just be in one lab or one academic department or the hospital. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=427.54s)]
*  It was the kind of cut that was just going to shake the campus really to its core. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  So what's Columbia supposed to do about this then? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=438.56s)]
*  What can it even do? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, that's an interesting question, but they got something of an answer a few days [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=443.26s)]
*  later when the federal government sent another letter to Columbia. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=446.78000000000003s)]
*  And this letter essentially was a ransom note, as some people have put it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=451.06s)]
*  It was a letter that spelled out a list of demands for Columbia to meet if it wanted [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=456.1s)]
*  to start a conversation with the federal government about restoring that $400 million in funding. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=461.7s)]
*  And what were those demands? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=467.1s)]
*  Well, the demands kind of ran the gamut. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  They were everything from having the university adopt a formal definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=471.2s)]
*  There was a push to ban masks on campus because a lot of protesters on campuses have been [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  covering their faces. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=483.34s)]
*  There was a call to really review the admissions process, to overhaul the disciplinary system, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  to empower campus security officers with arrest powers. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=490.62s)]
*  And then there was this idea that they should put Columbia's Middle Eastern, South Asian, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  African Studies Department under what the government described as academic receivership. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=499.48s)]
*  Okay, so some of the things that you outlined sound very extreme and some maybe less so [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=504.28000000000003s)]
*  based on my limited knowledge of how universities operate. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  How do we interpret some of these demands? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=512.52s)]
*  Some of them were, as you said, kind of mainstream, if you will. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=515.24s)]
*  I mean, like the mask ban proposal was pretty well in line with what the University of California [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=518.76s)]
*  system has done. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=523.4s)]
*  So that wasn't seen as this totally off the wall demand. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=524.76s)]
*  The idea that you would have security officers with arrest powers, a lot of campus police [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=528.46s)]
*  departments around the country have arrest powers. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=534.08s)]
*  It's a somewhat loaded question to a school like Columbia, which has a long history of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=537.52s)]
*  campus protest and a complicated history with the police. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=540.96s)]
*  But the one that really got the biggest attention was this idea of academic receivership that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=544.6600000000001s)]
*  really set off alarm bells all over the campus and all over academia. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=550.94s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  The reason is because historically universities, especially private ones, have near absolute [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=558.12s)]
*  control over what they're teaching and how they're running their academic departments. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=564.46s)]
*  So the idea that the federal government would directly or indirectly dictate to a university [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=568.86s)]
*  what its curriculum and teaching should look like, that was a red flag. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=576.5s)]
*  And one thing to remember though is that this letter to Columbia did not arrive in a vacuum. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=581.26s)]
*  This has been months and months of scrutiny on Columbia that's been building. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=587.02s)]
*  And then these last few weeks, you've even had Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Officers [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=592.1s)]
*  on campus. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=596.8s)]
*  You've had a green card holder, Mahmood Khalil, detained because of his protest activities. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=598.0s)]
*  There's been this threat, this implied threat of deporting students and pulling visas. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=604.26s)]
*  And it's really created this challenging environment where Columbia has felt besieged, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=609.52s)]
*  in every way you could imagine. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=617.4000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so obviously Columbia is under a ton of pressure. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=618.8000000000001s)]
*  And I would imagine that there was also a lot of pressure from people who did not want [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=623.4200000000001s)]
*  the school to cave to the administration's demands. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=628.96s)]
*  Oh, there was so much pressure. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=631.76s)]
*  Even among people who were frustrated by Columbia over the last year, year and a half, there [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=634.0s)]
*  was fear that Columbia was going to cave to these demands. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=640.5600000000001s)]
*  The idea that the Trump administration could effectively bully a university into doing [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=644.56s)]
*  something was really alarming to people. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=650.8s)]
*  And there was this really swelling fear and frustration as Columbia deliberated over what [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=653.92s)]
*  to do. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=660.1199999999999s)]
*  And on Friday afternoon, we got our answer when Columbia's interim president released [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=661.54s)]
*  a letter and it basically said the university was bowing to the government's demands. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=670.04s)]
*  What do you make of the fact that they just kind of cave to everything? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=671.1999999999999s)]
*  Well Columbia never in its announcement really talked about the 400 million in funding. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=675.88s)]
*  They never made this explicit connection. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=681.5999999999999s)]
*  But I think the administration at Columbia felt like it had very little choice in the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=683.8s)]
*  matter. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=687.88s)]
*  You know, they could have litigated this. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=688.88s)]
*  There were people who were saying you should go to court, challenge the administration, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=690.68s)]
*  make them prove their case. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=694.5999999999999s)]
*  And Columbia made the calculation that it would agree. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=697.24s)]
*  Now some of these things were ideas that Columbia had already been kicking around before [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=700.8s)]
*  the administration sent the letter. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=705.88s)]
*  But the optics were really bad here. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=707.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean they were essentially saying we're going to do it in response to a letter from [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=709.8s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=714.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=715.16s)]
*  It seems like number one, the administration had Columbia over a barrel from the way that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=716.16s)]
*  you're describing it. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=719.3399999999999s)]
*  And number two, that they just decided like it is not worth fighting the government. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=720.3399999999999s)]
*  There was a calculation that was made that they either could not win this fight, would [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=724.92s)]
*  or would not win this fight, or it would get worse if they did try to fight it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=731.16s)]
*  And they came down on the side of seeking to settle. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=734.64s)]
*  But here's the kicker of all this. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=738.1s)]
*  This is the rub. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  By agreeing to all these concessions, Columbia did not automatically reopen the spigot of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=741.0799999999999s)]
*  400 million dollars. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  That 400 million dollars is not just automatically returned. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=748.8399999999999s)]
*  These concessions that Columbia made were essentially their effort to get the government [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=752.28s)]
*  to come to the negotiating table to talk about restoring that 400 million. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=758.04s)]
*  It wasn't even like, do all of this and you'll get your money back. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  It was do all of this and maybe we'll talk to you about getting your money back. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=764.56s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=768.1999999999999s)]
*  So if Columbia gets the money back, there's likely to be a bigger cost than what's already [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  been announced. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=773.7199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=774.7199999999999s)]
*  And that bigger cost. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=775.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, we've been focusing a lot on Columbia, but there are other schools that the administration [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=776.7199999999999s)]
*  has said that it's targeting, right? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=781.64s)]
*  Like it feels like we should be prepared to see these hardball tactics elsewhere soon. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=783.16s)]
*  You should absolutely be prepared to see those hardball tactics. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=788.8s)]
*  I mean, you've got dozens of universities in the first two months of the Trump administration [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=791.56s)]
*  that have been told they are facing an investigation by at least one agency of the federal government. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=797.02s)]
*  And they're not even all like Harvard and Columbia. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=803.62s)]
*  Ohio State University is on the list. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=808.56s)]
*  The University of Hawaii is on the list. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=811.12s)]
*  It's fair to say that the administration seems to be embarking on a coast to coast campaign [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=814.6s)]
*  against higher education. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=820.52s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=831.44s)]
*  So, Alan, before the break, you told us about some of the fear that these threats and these [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=832.44s)]
*  demands are instilling at not just Columbia, but more broadly at universities around the [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=843.5200000000001s)]
*  country. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=849.84s)]
*  So can you just tell us a little bit more about what you're hearing about that? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=850.84s)]
*  Well, remember, it's not just a matter of will the administration come after my particular [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=854.36s)]
*  university that's driving college presidents nuts right now. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=861.0s)]
*  The administration is looking at all kinds of budget cuts that could broadly affect higher [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=864.36s)]
*  education. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=868.76s)]
*  So one of the things we've been seeing the last few weeks is more hiring freezes. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=870.2s)]
*  We've seen the layoffs. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=874.82s)]
*  We've seen schools shutting down laboratories because they're starting to lose grant funding [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=875.96s)]
*  or they're fearing what's coming next. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=879.96s)]
*  Columbia is among the most powerful universities in the United States, one of the oldest, one [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=883.12s)]
*  of the richest. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=887.6s)]
*  And one of the biggest fears has been that if Columbia University cannot stand up to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=888.6s)]
*  the federal government for whatever reason, what are other universities supposed to do? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=895.12s)]
*  But just to play devil's advocate for a second here, I think a lot of people listening to [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=900.08s)]
*  this are going to think to themselves, well, why should universities get so much money [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=903.84s)]
*  from the federal government, especially the universities that are pretty rich to begin [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=907.84s)]
*  with? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  So can you just explain to us, like, why are these two institutions, the federal government [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=912.5600000000001s)]
*  and higher education, why are they so intertwined to begin with? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=917.12s)]
*  So this country has had higher education since before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=920.88s)]
*  But it wasn't until the late 19th century when Johns Hopkins University was founded [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=925.52s)]
*  as the nation's first research university when you started to see a much more explicit [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=929.84s)]
*  focus on research. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=934.32s)]
*  That took a little while to take root. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=937.08s)]
*  But around World War II is when the universities and the federal government really got to work [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=939.24s)]
*  with each other. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=944.32s)]
*  The country had a lot of wartime needs. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=948.7s)]
*  They needed big ideas, innovation, they needed interpreters and translators for these kind [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=950.7600000000001s)]
*  of esoteric languages. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=956.4200000000001s)]
*  And those were the kind of people you could find at universities. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=957.4200000000001s)]
*  And it created this relationship. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=961.5200000000001s)]
*  The idea was that the universities would get this research funding, it would fuel their [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=964.6600000000001s)]
*  the scientists, and then that research would flow into corporate America, it would flow [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=969.8s)]
*  into other parts of the government, other parts of academia. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  And the result was the country got new pharmaceutical drugs, new technology, Nobel Prize winners, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  come out of university labs in a lot of cases, doing federally funded research. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=985.8s)]
*  Now it's tens of billions of dollars a year that flow from the federal government down [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=990.1999999999999s)]
*  to the universities. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=995.52s)]
*  And just to be clear, when we're talking about federal money, we're not just talking about [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=996.52s)]
*  Columbia and the Ivy Leagues, right? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1008.16s)]
*  Can you just give us a sense, how dependent are universities across the board on federal [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1010.28s)]
*  money? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1015.04s)]
*  Oh, I mean, you have billions and billions of dollars that flow to campuses all over [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1016.04s)]
*  the country. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1021.76s)]
*  You've got the University of Georgia, which, for example, was getting federal funding for [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1022.88s)]
*  a lab that focused on peanuts. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1027.48s)]
*  You know, Illinois, they get money for insulin research. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1029.84s)]
*  You've had all this money flowing to public universities, private universities, red states, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1033.24s)]
*  blue states, you know, large, small. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1038.56s)]
*  Just about every college or university in this country has some kind of financial tie [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1041.84s)]
*  to the federal government. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1047.6s)]
*  Some of them have much larger financial ties than others. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1049.14s)]
*  But when you start talking about cutting research funding, the trickle down effect is enormous. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1051.74s)]
*  It's not just cutting off Harvard and Yale and the like. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1056.94s)]
*  It's cutting off potentially state universities near you. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1060.5800000000002s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1065.5s)]
*  But since you mentioned Harvard and Yale, those schools, along with Columbia and Penn [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1066.5800000000002s)]
*  and other places, are schools that have literally billions of dollars in endowments. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1071.2800000000002s)]
*  And so it feels reasonable to say, OK, for those schools that are sitting on top of these [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1077.34s)]
*  giant piles of money, they should be able to use their big endowments to pay for their [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1082.6599999999999s)]
*  day-to-day operations. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1087.26s)]
*  They should not need to rely on the federal government. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1088.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1091.1799999999998s)]
*  But one thing to know about endowments is they tend to have a lot of what are called [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1092.34s)]
*  restricted funds, which really limit what the money can be used for. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1095.74s)]
*  So for example, you, Rachel Abrams, might have donated money to a university for a specific [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1101.22s)]
*  topic, a specific job, a specific research project, whatever it might be. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1106.9s)]
*  That money cannot just be used for another project because they suddenly need the money. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1111.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1116.94s)]
*  You can't just go to the bank and say, I have something I want to research. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1117.94s)]
*  Give me $100 million, please. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1120.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1121.66s)]
*  I mean, it's not just like going to the ATM. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1122.66s)]
*  And not only are university officials really handcuffed on what they can do with their [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1125.58s)]
*  endowments, there's actually a push among some Republicans in Washington to tax the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1129.86s)]
*  biggest endowments at even higher levels. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1133.9399999999998s)]
*  So that happens. There will be even less money for them to be able to spend on things like [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1136.6599999999999s)]
*  research and the like. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1140.1799999999998s)]
*  So when you put all this together, the punitive threats to withhold funding, the broader [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1141.9799999999998s)]
*  budget cuts that we're seeing in the name of government efficiency, possible changes [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1146.78s)]
*  to the tax structure for endowments, what we're seeing is potentially a really dramatic [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1151.1399999999999s)]
*  realignment of the relationship between the federal government and universities in this [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1156.54s)]
*  country. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1160.34s)]
*  And what does that new realignment look like? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1161.4599999999998s)]
*  And what is driving it? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1163.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, look, there have been frustrations building with higher education for years and actually [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1165.74s)]
*  decades in this country. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1170.98s)]
*  There's been this idea that they're for the elite, they build the elite, they're too expensive. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1173.22s)]
*  What is even the point of a college degree? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1178.54s)]
*  And you've had this emerging tension between what universities think they should be and [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1181.06s)]
*  what other people in this country think they should be. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1187.9399999999998s)]
*  You're basically saying that there are two competing visions. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1190.48s)]
*  And I'm kind of wondering what the divide is here, because you had mentioned at one [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1194.64s)]
*  point that some of this tension is ideological. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1197.6s)]
*  So is there, for example, a vision that is coming from the left? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1200.24s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's just the left. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1204.32s)]
*  I think universities, especially the big research schools, have really assertive visions for [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1206.88s)]
*  their role in a modern society. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1213.76s)]
*  They want to be places where they're really, you know, training the great thinkers of the [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1216.64s)]
*  day, talking about the big debates, they're doing research that changes the world. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1221.8400000000001s)]
*  There is independence, they're extending their missions well beyond their campuses. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1226.72s)]
*  That's their vision. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1231.92s)]
*  Now, there's another school of thought. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1232.92s)]
*  Some of it is politically motivated, that these schools should not be what they are. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1235.0s)]
*  They should be places where teaching is the focus, where workforce development is the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  goal, where you should come out of college with a degree that prepares you for the quote [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1245.52s)]
*  unquote real world. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1249.6399999999999s)]
*  This school of thought is very stringent on the idea that they don't want universities [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1252.0s)]
*  and colleges to be, you know, ideology factories. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1256.6s)]
*  If you think through the list of complaints, it's that there's been affirmative action [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1260.6s)]
*  on campuses over the years. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1264.8799999999999s)]
*  It's that the people up in academia just sneer at the rest of the world. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1266.24s)]
*  They don't really want as many, I guess, abstract outcomes. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1269.74s)]
*  They want concrete things, you know, where you can take a degree and go do X, Y, or Z. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1273.84s)]
*  Now, this is not a new argument, but the reality is that universities have done a generally [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1279.08s)]
*  terrible job of making the case for themselves. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1285.8s)]
*  And why is that exactly? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1289.24s)]
*  You can probably blame it on a lot of different things. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1291.1599999999999s)]
*  Sometimes when they're talking about their research, they go so deep in the weeds, no [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1293.56s)]
*  one understands what the research is about or what it's going to do. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1296.56s)]
*  They've done a pretty terrible job of explaining how tuition costs work and how financial aid [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1300.08s)]
*  works. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1306.12s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if the last time you looked at like a financial aid application [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1307.12s)]
*  or a scholarship listing, it's this muck. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1309.84s)]
*  It's gobbledygook. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1312.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1313.56s)]
*  I mean, look, there's a whole body of research out there that says if you're a college graduate, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1314.56s)]
*  you are likely to have higher lifetime incomes, less likely to be in poverty. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1319.1799999999998s)]
*  The outcomes tend to be pretty good. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1323.6599999999999s)]
*  But what they haven't done a good job of is explaining that for whatever reason, they [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1326.8400000000001s)]
*  cannot muster much of a coherent defense. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  I do wonder if one of the reasons that universities are struggling to make a case for themselves [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1335.92s)]
*  is that they do need to be reformed. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1341.14s)]
*  Like any major institution with a multi-billion dollar budget probably does have some bloat [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1343.3600000000001s)]
*  and inefficiencies here and there. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1348.22s)]
*  But this conversation does feel connected to wider conversations we've been having recently [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1349.9s)]
*  on the show about government efficiency, like cutting federal agencies, for example. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1355.46s)]
*  Like sure, these places could probably be run better, but is it necessary to just gut [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1360.38s)]
*  them wholesale? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1366.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1367.54s)]
*  I mean, look, I would be hard pressed to name a college president who does not think there [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1368.54s)]
*  need to be changes somewhere in the system. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1374.3s)]
*  But I think they are worried about the proverbial throwing out the baby with the bathwater here. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1376.82s)]
*  They will acknowledge for all the flaws of universities, and they will often admit there [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1383.46s)]
*  are flaws, that the system is too much the envy of the world to just trash. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1388.02s)]
*  You know, it really feels like we are in a moment where the kind of existential fear [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1396.1000000000001s)]
*  that you described, it's allowing the Trump administration to wring some pretty stunning [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1400.92s)]
*  concessions from institutions that traditionally have prided themselves on their independence. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1405.92s)]
*  And I wonder how the people that you are talking to within academia are viewing what's [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1411.24s)]
*  happening to them within this broader context. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1418.16s)]
*  Well, there's a long history in the world of authoritarian regimes trying to pressure [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1421.4s)]
*  universities and transform them. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1429.1200000000001s)]
*  And there are some people in academia who feel these last few months have been at least [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1433.48s)]
*  steps toward that kind of reality. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1439.8s)]
*  They see these steps as out of a strongman playbook. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1444.6s)]
*  You know, there was a book a couple years ago by the president of Johns Hopkins called [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1448.74s)]
*  What Universities Owe Democracy? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1454.0s)]
*  And he talked about in that book, how the fate of universities and liberal democracies [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1456.8s)]
*  are entwined with one another. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1462.6599999999999s)]
*  So there are people in academia who are giving voice to these types of things. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1465.84s)]
*  There was a statement last week from a center at Georgetown University that talked about [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1471.06s)]
*  kind of an encroaching authoritarianism by the administration, throwing out words like [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1477.04s)]
*  McCarthyism. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1482.1999999999998s)]
*  We keep hearing that word thrown around a lot. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1483.1999999999998s)]
*  That kind of speech-suppressing, speech-chilling atmosphere is what people are starting to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1485.3799999999999s)]
*  compare this moment to. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1491.8s)]
*  On Saturday, I was talking with Mary Sue Coleman, who is a former president of the University [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1495.16s)]
*  of Michigan and the University of Iowa. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1499.68s)]
*  And I was asking her, you know, what do you make of this decision by Columbia to concede [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1502.0s)]
*  what the administration wanted? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1506.68s)]
*  And her answer was pretty revealing. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1509.42s)]
*  And she said, I was alarmed by it because of what the ultimate consequences might be [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1510.92s)]
*  for higher education. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1515.24s)]
*  But I don't want to say if I were sitting in their shoes that I would have made a different [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1517.18s)]
*  decision. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1521.3600000000001s)]
*  Because these universities might have just calculated that it's just not worth fighting. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1522.68s)]
*  They don't stand a chance. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1526.18s)]
*  I think some universities may very well decide it's an act of survival. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1528.0600000000002s)]
*  And I think one of the biggest questions that's still out there is, what will the surviving [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1532.0800000000002s)]
*  university look like? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1536.48s)]
*  Will it be these places where research has flourished and there's been a lot of debate? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1539.3200000000002s)]
*  Or will it be something different? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1545.0800000000002s)]
*  And I think whatever the answer is, it's going to shape this country for a very long time. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1547.02s)]
*  Ellen, thank you so much. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1553.68s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtsFkF6Zpqo&t=1555.68s)]
