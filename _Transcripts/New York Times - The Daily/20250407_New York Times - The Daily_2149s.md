# ‘I Felt Ashamed.’ Why One Lawyer Resigned When His Firm Caved to Trump
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=4.54s)]
*  This is an absolute honor to sign. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=5.54s)]
*  The president signed an executive order singling out Perkins Coe. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=10.42s)]
*  What they've done is just terrible. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=14.38s)]
*  It's weaponization. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=17.82s)]
*  Over the past few weeks, Donald Trump has used executive orders to wage war on law firm [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=20.46s)]
*  after law firm. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=26.88s)]
*  Those who made the list are a real murderer's row, including Covington and Burling. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=28.28s)]
*  Paul Weiss, Jenner and Block. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=32.620000000000005s)]
*  Big law, white shoe firm, some of the best lawyers in the country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=34.52s)]
*  Specifically targeting those whose current or former lawyers have investigated him, sued [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  him or represented his enemies in court. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  But rather than fighting Trump, the Trump administration reached a settlement with the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Skadden Arps, Slate and Meager firms. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=54.44s)]
*  Many of those firms have buckled. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=57.44s)]
*  President Trump yesterday rescinded an executive order targeting prominent law firm Paul Weiss. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  Milbank joins firms Wilkie Farr and Gallagher, which also cut a deal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=65.48s)]
*  The question left in the air, of course, is who's next? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=69.58s)]
*  Negotiating deals that give Trump much of what he wants and forcing thousands of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=72.32s)]
*  lawyers who work at those firms to make a choice. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=77.62s)]
*  Remain at firms that have capitulated. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=81.72s)]
*  Or quit in protest. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  Most have chosen to stay. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=90.44s)]
*  Thomas Sipp chose to quit. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=94.36s)]
*  Today, I asked him to explain why. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah, come on in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=107.64s)]
*  Put on these headphones. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=116.36s)]
*  These? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=118.16s)]
*  Uh, I think yes, those. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=119.16s)]
*  Comfy? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=122.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=123.4s)]
*  Good. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=124.4s)]
*  Thomas, welcome to the daily. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=125.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=128.4s)]
*  I'm getting the small sense that this is a nerve wracking experience for you even before [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  it started. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=135.72s)]
*  I'm just seeing it on your face. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=136.72s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely is. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=137.72s)]
*  We have been trying here at the daily for a few weeks to understand what it's like to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=139.32s)]
*  work at one of the law firms that's now at the center of President Trump's campaign of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=145.36s)]
*  retribution and to have watched from within those firms as one by one by one, these very [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=151.12s)]
*  big and powerful firms have capitulated to the president's pretty unusual demands. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=159.76s)]
*  And it may not shock you to learn this, but attorneys at these firms are pretty reluctant [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=166.48s)]
*  to talk about that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=171.4s)]
*  And you are the rare exception. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=172.4s)]
*  So thank you for being the exception. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=175.04s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=178.0s)]
*  I want to start by asking you to explain, Thomas, how it is that you came to be a lawyer [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=179.4s)]
*  in the first place and ended up at this very prestigious firm where you worked until just [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=187.24s)]
*  a few days ago, Skatt & Arps. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=192.32s)]
*  What's that story? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=194.16s)]
*  So going all the way to the start, I was born in Japan to an American father and a Japanese [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=195.94s)]
*  mother. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=202.16s)]
*  And my family moved to the United States when I was 10. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=203.78s)]
*  My parents separated shortly after. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=207.72s)]
*  And so, you know, I was learning English in middle school and also learning about what [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=210.84s)]
*  it means to be an American, because before that I was really just like a native Japanese [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=216.56s)]
*  kid. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=221.48s)]
*  And I was through that experience, including of suddenly becoming this sort of racial minority [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=223.72s)]
*  because I'm mixed race and coming to understand the social fabric that's kind of unique to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=229.88s)]
*  the United States, especially compared to a relatively homogeneous country like Japan. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=234.76s)]
*  And growing up with my single mom who doesn't speak fluent English and getting all those [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=241.0s)]
*  sort of experiences, I think, started to put me on the path that I'm on now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=248.12s)]
*  Can you just explain that? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=252.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=254.04s)]
*  I mean, there were difficult days for sure. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=255.04s)]
*  I think even though this week has been very difficult for me, I still look back and think [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=257.88s)]
*  of some of the days that I experienced as a kid in middle school, whether it's not being [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=262.36s)]
*  able to make friends, being made fun of for my accent and stuff like that, that really, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=269.88s)]
*  I think, started to form like that sense of injustice that I think fuels me sometimes. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  What was the first real injustice you can remember as an immigrant not really knowing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=282.28s)]
*  English navigating this new world? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=287.84s)]
*  I think there was a time when I was in math class. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=291.76s)]
*  And, you know, math is the same, so I could answer the questions. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=293.67999999999995s)]
*  And I think one of the answers was 33. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=296.44s)]
*  And you could probably tell that I paused even before I said it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=299.12s)]
*  And it's because back then I would have pronounced it differently because I couldn't pronounce [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=301.44s)]
*  TH. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=305.88000000000005s)]
*  And the whole class laughed, even though it's the right answer. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=306.88000000000005s)]
*  But then I would go home and I would, you know, close my door, put my book back down, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=311.56s)]
*  and just practice words that I couldn't pronounce, like 33. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=315.76000000000005s)]
*  I'd just say it over and over and over again, other words like world, you know, these basic [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=318.72s)]
*  words that come up in everyday dialogue. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=323.32000000000005s)]
*  And that was part of my experience. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=326.08000000000004s)]
*  At the same time, I moved to the United States, you know, in 2008 and during that election. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=327.6s)]
*  And there's all this conversation in America about hopefulness and about this being a country [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=333.72s)]
*  where there's a place for anyone. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=340.24s)]
*  Right. And so I was also absorbing that as well. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=343.52s)]
*  So at the precise moment that you are struggling with your identity and recognizing that you [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=347.44s)]
*  are different from other people. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=353.64s)]
*  And it sounds like feeling at times a lot of shame around that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=354.76s)]
*  You're seeing the United States elect Barack Obama like you, the product of a biracial [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=358.84s)]
*  marriage and somebody who in that campaign you're describing invites the whole country [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=367.56s)]
*  to have this really honest conversation about identity and about race. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=373.68s)]
*  And he talks about and this is from his 2004 DNC speech, but it's one of my favorites and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=377.84s)]
*  talks about being like a skinny kid with a funny name. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=383.56s)]
*  I remember other parts of the speech, too, because it just sticks with you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=386.64s)]
*  In high school, I joined a debate team to practice public speaking, try to get over [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=389.68s)]
*  that fear. That was part of also, I think, my path to being a lawyer. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=394.64s)]
*  And in college, I was studying political science at the University of Texas, and I had [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=400.68s)]
*  this wonderful opportunity to be an intern at the United States Senate. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=408.6s)]
*  Wow. This was probably basically like a decade after I moved to the United States. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=414.04s)]
*  And suddenly I'm walking through the halls of Congress with my little yellow Senate [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=419.56s)]
*  intern badge and running into senators and congressmen getting to sit in on important [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=424.20000000000005s)]
*  hearings. And it's during that time that I really decided I want to be a part of this [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=432.04s)]
*  project here in the United States. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=438.72s)]
*  And when you say this project, what do you mean? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  I'd say, you know, march towards justice, the betterment of everyone. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  I think there are these core principles that are unique to the United States in many ways. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=447.6s)]
*  You know, if it's not unique, then it's something that the United States really has the [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=452.16s)]
*  potential, maybe more than any other country on Earth, to embody, which is that this is a place [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=457.36s)]
*  where anyone can come work hard and be an American. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=463.12s)]
*  Yeah, I'm getting from you a real sense of idealism and a real pure admiration for what the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=469.0s)]
*  United States represents. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=478.16s)]
*  Yeah. I'm not blind to the errors in the past, and I know that the United States has not been and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=479.44s)]
*  still is not a perfect country. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=486.84s)]
*  But I really still believe that, you know, when the United States is doing the right things, the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=489.23999999999995s)]
*  whole world is a better place because of it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=493.76s)]
*  So talk about how this all translates into your decision to become a lawyer, to enter this [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=496.2s)]
*  industry. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=502.64s)]
*  Well, so picking back up where, you know, I was just sent an intern in D.C., I'm looking around and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=503.2s)]
*  seeing that a lot of the people with the cool jobs in D.C. tend to have law degrees and, you know, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=508.55999999999995s)]
*  right, where they're actively practicing law. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=512.64s)]
*  So I figured it was the next best step afterward. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=515.88s)]
*  And so I go to law school straight out of college. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=520.44s)]
*  I, you know, get into a lot of law schools and I'm balancing offers. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  The exercise a lot of incoming law students have to do when they're admitted is balance the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=529.4000000000001s)]
*  prestige of the law school versus how much money they're offering you. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=535.5200000000001s)]
*  And I chose Columbia Law School because they gave me a pretty good balance. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=540.2s)]
*  And, you know, like many other law students, I cover the balance with student loans. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=544.28s)]
*  And that starts to take us to the next steps. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=549.04s)]
*  As a 22 year old trying to pay off a six figure debt, I was drawn toward a higher salary, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=551.72s)]
*  among other things. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=559.6s)]
*  All the law firms, the big law firms, almost by definition, pay the same scale salary. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=560.96s)]
*  So the way that these law firms distinguish themselves from each other oftentimes is in [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=566.6s)]
*  things like how their pro-prono program operates, how their billable hours, you know, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=572.56s)]
*  requirement operates, how invested they are into diversity initiatives and how actively [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=577.36s)]
*  their, you know, their affinity groups recruit on law schools. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=583.64s)]
*  And I chose Skadden because it had the prestige. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=587.96s)]
*  I'm just going to explain to people, by Skadden you mean Skadden Arps? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=591.76s)]
*  Skadden Arps, yes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=595.28s)]
*  Big, big law firm has an office here in New York, has offices, I think, all over the world. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=596.4s)]
*  It's one of the firms that we think of when we think of this concept of big law, law firms [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=600.16s)]
*  that do a huge amount of work in corporate America. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=604.8s)]
*  That's right. And Skadden really advertised two things. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=608.4s)]
*  It's pro-bono program and its diversity initiatives. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=612.52s)]
*  With regard to the pro-bono programs, Skadden had a rule, basically, that said that you [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=615.96s)]
*  can count an unlimited number of your pro-bono hours towards your billable hours requirement. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=623.24s)]
*  And the billable hours, you know, kind of represents two things. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=628.5200000000001s)]
*  So if you meet the requirement, you get a bonus at the end of the year. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=631.76s)]
*  So that's more money. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=634.4000000000001s)]
*  And then you're also in good standing, right? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=635.84s)]
*  You're doing enough work. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=639.24s)]
*  You know, you're meeting your hours. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=640.6s)]
*  And it was a big deal that Skadden does that because not many other firms do. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=642.5200000000001s)]
*  Right. And if I know my law firm culture well, what that means is that charitable legal [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=646.88s)]
*  work that this firm does counts against you being a successful lawyer there, which [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=653.48s)]
*  probably means to a young idealistic lawyer like you, it means that, yes, while you're [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=659.44s)]
*  going to work at a big, hard charging corporate law firm, that that law firm is putting [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=665.44s)]
*  pro-bono work, work for people who can't afford lawyers at the center of its culture. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=677.48s)]
*  And I worked on, I'm just going to speak prolly on this, but matters related to [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=678.92s)]
*  unhoused people, immigration and police misconduct. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=684.52s)]
*  Did you win any of those cases? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=689.52s)]
*  Did you win all those cases? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=691.64s)]
*  I can't say. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=693.36s)]
*  But the smile on your face makes me think that you might have prevailed on behalf of [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=695.8s)]
*  some of those clients. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=700.8s)]
*  When we were texting today, because I needed you to get here on time, you mentioned [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=703.24s)]
*  that you live essentially next door to the law firm and that doesn't seem like an [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=708.2s)]
*  accident. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=711.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=712.32s)]
*  I decided to pay a little bit more in rent for a slightly worse apartment just so I [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=713.84s)]
*  can be close to the office. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  How close? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm talking like a five minute walk. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=721.76s)]
*  So you could just be there all the time. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=723.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=725.72s)]
*  Obviously, at a big law firm like this, it's challenging work, it's long hours, high [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=726.48s)]
*  pressure environments. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=732.88s)]
*  You're closely scrutinizing the grammar and all of your sentences that you write, even [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=734.96s)]
*  in internal emails and all that stuff, because it can affect your reputation and your [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=739.6s)]
*  credibility. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=744.24s)]
*  But at the same time, in those long hours and in this high pressure environment, you [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=745.08s)]
*  make friends really quickly. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=749.0s)]
*  And there are great mentors out there too who I learned from. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=751.0s)]
*  So actually, I liked going into work every day. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  If you ask people who I worked with, I'm sure they tell you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=758.84s)]
*  I was often there very early and late, but that's partly because I just want to say, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=761.88s)]
*  good morning and good night to everyone in my hallway. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=765.92s)]
*  So when did you start to understand, Thomas, over the past many weeks, that Skadden had [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=768.88s)]
*  entered the president's crosshairs? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=777.28s)]
*  So on March 17th, when the EEOC, which stands for the Equal Employment Opportunity [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=779.6800000000001s)]
*  Commission, basically published this letter listing 20 law firms, including my own, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=785.16s)]
*  saying that these law firms are essentially under investigation for their practices [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=790.6s)]
*  related to diversity. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=795.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=796.52s)]
*  I believe the claim was that these law firms may have practiced discrimination [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=796.72s)]
*  through the application of diversity, equity and inclusion practices. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=801.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=806.04s)]
*  And I think it was the following weekend on that Sunday in the afternoon, one of my [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=806.6s)]
*  friends from the firm sends me this tweet. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=812.4s)]
*  Basically, it's a thread posted by Dinesh D'Souza. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=816.8s)]
*  The right-wing activist. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=820.8399999999999s)]
*  The right-wing activist. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=821.72s)]
*  Basically discussing how Skadden is representing a client against him related to this [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=823.0s)]
*  widely debunked conspiracy theory documentary about the 2020 election. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=830.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=835.48s)]
*  That D'Souza had made. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=835.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=837.12s)]
*  And Elon Musk tweets on that thread saying something along the lines of, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=838.16s)]
*  Skadden just needs to stop. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=843.8s)]
*  So there's a letter and then there's this tweet. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=845.6s)]
*  And while all of this is happening, there are other law firms that are dealing with [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=847.76s)]
*  similar things, including Perkins-Cooey, who was hit with a executive order earlier [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  in the month. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=856.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=857.88s)]
*  And these executive orders, I think it's worth reminding listeners, they can feel to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=858.2s)]
*  the law firms that are being hit with them like death sentences because they explicitly [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=864.72s)]
*  prevent these firms like Perkins-Cooey from interacting with the federal government. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=870.36s)]
*  And so, and we've talked about this on the show, if these firms represent any [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=875.36s)]
*  corporation or entity that needs the federal government, and many big companies do, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=880.2800000000001s)]
*  suddenly they can't really effectively represent them. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=884.32s)]
*  And in that sense, the people who work at these firms fear that they may go out of [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=887.0400000000001s)]
*  business. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=890.8000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=891.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=892.0s)]
*  And Thursday comes around. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=892.72s)]
*  My friend again sends me an article that the New York Times published, basically [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=895.0s)]
*  stating that Skadden was in talks with the administration to avert an executive order. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=899.84s)]
*  And this was after Paul Weiss, which is essentially a peer firm, made a deal, including [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=905.96s)]
*  for $40 million pro bono commitment to causes that the president agrees with. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=911.0400000000001s)]
*  So what are you and the people you work with thinking as you're watching this happen? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=916.0s)]
*  We're not necessarily surprised, but we're still shocked. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=921.6s)]
*  And during that preceding week, there had been pockets of the law firm trying to [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=924.44s)]
*  organize some sort of request for a response, nothing publicly, but at least internally [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=931.1600000000001s)]
*  seeking clarity and hoping to provide at least some input into what the attorneys who [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=936.32s)]
*  actually work there feel about what's going on and how so many of us believe that it's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=940.7600000000001s)]
*  unconstitutional. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=946.36s)]
*  The executive orders. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=947.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=948.96s)]
*  And you want to communicate that to your bosses. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=951.72s)]
*  During this month, there are law firms that are fighting back. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=952.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=955.76s)]
*  There are law firms that take on representation of the law firms being targeted, right. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=956.84s)]
*  Which puts them at risk, but they're willing to say, hey, we know what's right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  And we see that that's being celebrated within the legal community. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=965.4s)]
*  And it's like, this is not a difficult legal question. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=968.28s)]
*  There's no legal basis for what the president is doing. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=971.36s)]
*  It's complete abuse of power. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=974.04s)]
*  And so we want our firm to stand up for that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=975.84s)]
*  And, you know, a lot of associates, I think even partners would feel betrayed by an [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=979.16s)]
*  agreement. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=986.04s)]
*  So that's what we're trying to express. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=986.4s)]
*  But we're feeling like things are moving really fast and we felt voiceless. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=989.08s)]
*  So what happens next? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=994.8000000000001s)]
*  So then this Friday, there was this email thread that got around to parts of the firm. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=997.36s)]
*  And the discussion is basically, should attorneys still have access to the firm-wide [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1003.84s)]
*  distribution lists, which is basically these mailing lists that allow attorneys to ask [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1011.44s)]
*  questions broadly to the rest of the firm or, you know, communicate broadly. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1015.76s)]
*  And so when I see that, I realized at that point, that's pretty likely that there's [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1020.0s)]
*  going to be a deal and that it's going to be one that the attorneys don't like. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1026.48s)]
*  And, you know, within hours, I think, we again find out from the news and from, you [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1034.36s)]
*  know, President Trump's, I think it's like true social, that there is this agreement. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1044.8799999999999s)]
*  And then we hear from the firm. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1052.4399999999998s)]
*  They have done a deal. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1054.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1056.1999999999998s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1063.36s)]
*  I just want to summarize what is in this deal that Skadden reached with President Trump. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1075.04s)]
*  It promises to provide $100 million in pro bono legal services from Skadden to causes [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1081.0s)]
*  that both President Trump and the law firm both support. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1090.04s)]
*  It calls for hiring what are known as Skadden fellows. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1094.4399999999998s)]
*  Those fellows are, at least some of them, supposed to be focused on Trump-friendly [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1099.1999999999998s)]
*  issues, and some of them have to be conservative in their ideological outlook. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1103.36s)]
*  And then there's a part of the agreement that vows that Skadden will not engage in [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1109.36s)]
*  quote unquote, illegal DEI hiring practices. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1113.76s)]
*  Broadly, this is the deal that every major law firm that has come to an agreement has [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1118.36s)]
*  reached with the president. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1124.6s)]
*  So what is your reaction to this deal when you finally digest it? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1125.56s)]
*  Personally, I felt ashamed to work at Skadden. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's such a new experience because of how prestigious the law firm is. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1135.12s)]
*  And then suddenly, in the blink of an eye, in just a few days, hours even, like my whole [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1140.28s)]
*  view of the firm has been completely tainted. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1147.7199999999998s)]
*  Can you explain why? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1151.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, is it the fact that the firm agreed to this? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  Is it the specifics around pro bono work, which I know is so important to you? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1156.84s)]
*  What precisely is making you feel the shame? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1160.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's a mix of things. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  This is giving the president a PR win after being bullied. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1166.0s)]
*  So it seems like I'm working at a firm that, you know, isn't as high caliber as it [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1171.76s)]
*  said it was. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1176.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1178.36s)]
*  But more importantly than that, so many lawyers agree that what the president is [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1179.12s)]
*  doing is wrong, trying to punish his enemies and then coerce any law firm who he [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1184.36s)]
*  perceives as an enemy to either himself or to his circle from being able to [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1191.96s)]
*  represent clients who might be against them. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is happening in a much bigger political climate where there's fear [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1201.48s)]
*  spreading when a judge makes a decision that goes against the president. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1208.8400000000001s)]
*  There shouldn't be politicians calling for their impeachment. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1216.5200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1219.8000000000002s)]
*  But that's what's happening right now. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1220.0s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1220.88s)]
*  This is a threat to our constitutional fabric, to our democracy, to our civil [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1221.96s)]
*  liberties. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1228.16s)]
*  You know, people should be able to be represented by, by their lawyers freely. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1229.24s)]
*  Judges should be able to make decisions, even if it goes against the president. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1233.24s)]
*  And to see Skadden be complicit to aid this attack, I was so ashamed to work there. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1236.92s)]
*  So what did you do? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1247.72s)]
*  So on Sunday night, I start actually just writing down notes and really my questions. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1249.68s)]
*  Some of them are practical, like how's this going to be enforced? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1257.08s)]
*  What will it actually look like? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1261.8s)]
*  You're kind of writing to your bosses. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1263.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1264.48s)]
*  What do these words mean? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1264.64s)]
*  And a lot of the questions I started thinking about and finding answers. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1267.16s)]
*  And so the questions became statements and I realized what I had written was a [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1270.68s)]
*  draft of resignation letter. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1276.08s)]
*  So that's not necessarily what you set out to do. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1277.84s)]
*  No. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1280.24s)]
*  And Monday comes around and I have some conversations, you know, in the office [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1281.6s)]
*  with other attorneys and my friends and trusted mentors and colleagues. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1288.12s)]
*  I just want to hear what people had to say and think. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1294.08s)]
*  And everyone's distraught. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1297.0s)]
*  Can I ask you to read from parts of the letter? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1299.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1303.9599999999998s)]
*  Dear colleagues and friends, I'm writing to let you know that I'm leaving this firm. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1311.6s)]
*  There was a time when my employment here was so unlikely. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1319.24s)]
*  For much of my early childhood, I was not a good student. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1322.52s)]
*  I struggled to focus in class and take anything seriously. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1326.28s)]
*  But even then there was one subject I loved, history. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1329.56s)]
*  I thought it was so wonderful to learn about all that came before me, about the [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1334.9199999999998s)]
*  triumphs and tragedies, about the moments of individual bravery and collective complacency. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1339.68s)]
*  I would often imagine myself faced with the same dilemmas. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1346.92s)]
*  What would I do if I was there? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1351.84s)]
*  Would I do the right thing? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1354.24s)]
*  It always felt like there was no way to know. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1357.48s)]
*  I believe, as I know many of you do, that what the current presidential [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1361.36s)]
*  administration is doing is wrong. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1366.0s)]
*  That we are sliding into an autocracy where those in power are above the rule of law. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1369.12s)]
*  Skadden's agreement with the Trump administration sent our country deeper down this descent. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1374.52s)]
*  And then I finish, Skadden is on the wrong side of history. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1382.84s)]
*  I can no longer stay knowing that someday I would have to explain why I stayed. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1388.2s)]
*  What did it feel like to hit send? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1396.0s)]
*  I mean, listen to your breathing right now. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1405.24s)]
*  It's like you're reliving it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1407.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1408.96s)]
*  What was it like to send that email? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1410.24s)]
*  If you heard my breath, it felt like that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1413.12s)]
*  Maybe a hundred times more though, because I knew that, you know, that was a pivotal moment in my life. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1416.4s)]
*  Maybe, maybe just as pivotal as coming to the United States in the first place. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1422.04s)]
*  If I, if I might add, I grew up with two sisters, a twin sister and a younger sister. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1425.44s)]
*  And my parents asked us back in Japan, whether we wanted to move to the United States so that we can learn English. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1430.4s)]
*  Actually, that was the reason why. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  And I remember just thinking like, I was scared. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1437.68s)]
*  I don't speak English. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1441.4s)]
*  But I was the one from my sisters who said, I think we should. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  And my parents let us choose, you know, and it felt like that. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1449.8400000000001s)]
*  Too. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1454.96s)]
*  I knew that I was closing some doors and, you know, a place like Skadden, like for that 10 year old kid, he had no idea where he might end up. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1456.76s)]
*  And I'm grateful for that experience. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1470.0s)]
*  I think it's only possible in a country like the United States. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1474.24s)]
*  And I really, really believe in it. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1479.3600000000001s)]
*  I know not everyone can make this decision, including even those in my law firm. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1482.76s)]
*  You know, there are people who have families who depend on their income, who can't just quit on a dime like I did, you know, without a job lined up. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1486.8400000000001s)]
*  There are people who are here at the law firm on work visas because they're not United States citizens. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1494.0s)]
*  And like those people can't really speak out because of this climate of intimidation. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1498.3200000000002s)]
*  Everyone has their own reasons, I think. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1503.24s)]
*  And I just want to say thank you to all the people who read my resignation letter. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1505.6399999999999s)]
*  There have been. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1512.08s)]
*  I mean, you didn't, we should say, mean for this letter to become. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1512.7199999999998s)]
*  As public as it did. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1516.9599999999998s)]
*  It kind of just happened. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1517.9599999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1519.08s)]
*  Well, and I knew that in putting in writing, there was a risk, but, you know, I sent it to my, my immediate colleagues and then it was posted online the following day. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1519.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you're aware that many people who have spoken out against president Trump and his policies have experienced at times, ferocious blowback. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1530.84s)]
*  It can be a life altering event. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1543.1999999999998s)]
*  Is that something you're worried about now? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1545.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1547.56s)]
*  And I was finally able to talk to my mother after, you know, resigning, telling her that I quit because I hadn't talked to her about my thoughts, you know, since it all happened so fast. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1548.08s)]
*  And she's in back in Japan, you know, with the rest of my family. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1558.48s)]
*  And I told her I quit and she's like, do you have another job? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1562.32s)]
*  And I was like, no, mom, you don't understand. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1565.64s)]
*  Like, this is like in the news. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1566.92s)]
*  And I quit because of what's going on in America right now. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1569.36s)]
*  That's the question my mother would ask me. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1571.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1573.0s)]
*  And she sort of didn't process it at first. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1574.6s)]
*  And then she started to cry. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1578.08s)]
*  She realized what's happening and she asked me to come back to Japan. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1579.64s)]
*  I said, no, I can't. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1585.6s)]
*  And I won't. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1589.04s)]
*  I made this decision because I believe that there's still hope. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1590.12s)]
*  And I owe it to America, I think, to stay here and speak out on this issue. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1595.28s)]
*  Many of your colleagues are not leaving their jobs. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1602.96s)]
*  And there's a spectrum of reasons that you've started to hint at about why they're not leaving. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1606.52s)]
*  They may feel the way you feel and have two kids they have to put through college. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1610.6s)]
*  They might not feel the way you feel. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1615.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm thinking about reporting my colleagues did inside the upper echelons of Paul Weiss [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1618.0s)]
*  when that law firm did a deal with Trump. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1623.52s)]
*  And it became clear that the majority of the people who run the firm, lots of them, felt [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1626.68s)]
*  that the best thing to do was to make a deal. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1633.28s)]
*  And the reason that they articulated, they felt that way is that in their minds, they [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1635.68s)]
*  had to protect the thousands of people who work at these firms. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1642.68s)]
*  They may have hated the deal. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1647.6000000000001s)]
*  Some of them no doubt hate the deal, but they felt their job was to make sure that these [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1648.72s)]
*  firms survives, lives through this period of time. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1653.8s)]
*  And then at the end of the day, what they're giving up is small compared to that survival. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1659.6000000000001s)]
*  And the bosses at all these firms that end up capitulating to Trump say some version [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1666.48s)]
*  of we are the same law firm after we did these deals as we were before. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1671.8s)]
*  In fact, in a company wide email, your former boss says just that, quote, this agreement [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1678.48s)]
*  does not change who we are. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1685.32s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1688.72s)]
*  I just don't think that's true. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1689.96s)]
*  These law firms are agreeing to these deals when they know that there's no legal basis [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  for any friend executive order. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1698.96s)]
*  And to the extent that these firms feel an existential threat to the firm itself by [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1701.3600000000001s)]
*  capitulating, they're aiding, you know, this existential threat against the profession, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1709.64s)]
*  the independence of the judiciary and our democracy and everyone who depends on it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1717.0s)]
*  It does change who the firm is. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1725.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1727.5600000000002s)]
*  In short. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1727.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1728.5600000000002s)]
*  I think all of these firms that are making these deals and defecting, they're worried [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1729.8400000000001s)]
*  about losing clients to a peer firm that's connected to the administration already. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1734.3200000000002s)]
*  And these firms are betting on the president to succeed, right? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1740.3600000000001s)]
*  From a PR perspective, because they can say, look, it was a smart deal. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1745.92s)]
*  But the smart deal is with this president who is trying to actively undermine our [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1749.64s)]
*  profession and our democracy. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1755.7600000000002s)]
*  And, you know, for the firm to say, Hey, it doesn't change who we are. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1758.44s)]
*  I think it fundamentally does. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1763.76s)]
*  You very clearly have a lot of faith in the U.S. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1766.84s)]
*  That's just been evident throughout this entire conversation. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1772.52s)]
*  And your decision to quit seems to be grounded in the sense of what is the best version of [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1777.16s)]
*  what the U.S. can be in your mind. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1781.6s)]
*  But at this point, how confident are you, given everything you've just been through, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1784.8s)]
*  that the version of the United States that seems to be at the center of everything you've [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1790.2s)]
*  done here is now the version of the United States? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1795.84s)]
*  Confident because of what so many people, strangers, you know, reaching out to me have [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1799.8s)]
*  said to me, which is that they're also scared. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1803.76s)]
*  Everyone is scared. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1806.32s)]
*  But if everyone could, you know, stand up and speak up about this, then we can turn [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1807.8s)]
*  this back. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1813.8s)]
*  I think we can save it still. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1815.6s)]
*  But are you a little bit worried that you're making the wrong bet and that maybe the law [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1818.84s)]
*  firms, as much as it might pain you to think about it this way, are making the sound bet [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1824.36s)]
*  in this moment? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1829.84s)]
*  Well, of course, I'm worried. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1831.6399999999999s)]
*  I guess, you know, I'm putting my career on the line for this, and I knew that going [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1833.28s)]
*  into this. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1839.84s)]
*  I have student loans. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1841.32s)]
*  I have a single mom who, you know. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1842.32s)]
*  Andrew just publicly picked a little bit of a fight with the president. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1844.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1847.72s)]
*  I wonder if this experience made you question going into law. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1849.08s)]
*  I mean, law is one thing in theory, and then it's another thing in practice, especially [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1855.32s)]
*  at these big law firms. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1861.52s)]
*  These are not nonprofits. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1863.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1864.52s)]
*  And that's part of the decision I made when I was in law school, finding a job, my first [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1865.52s)]
*  job. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1869.52s)]
*  And, you know, to ask your ultimate question, no, I don't. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1870.52s)]
*  I don't regret becoming a lawyer and going to law school. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1875.52s)]
*  It's a wonderful education. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1878.52s)]
*  You know, even my time at Skadden, I learned so much. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1880.52s)]
*  I learned so much, and it's equipped me with skills, I think, to advocate for what I believe [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1883.52s)]
*  in and for others as well. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1892.52s)]
*  And that's what lawyers do. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1897.52s)]
*  Well, Thomas, thank you for coming in here and for telling us this story. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1902.52s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1908.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1911.52s)]
*  On Friday, hundreds of firms threw their support behind the first firm to be attacked by President [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1913.52s)]
*  Trump, Perkins Coie, which has sued the administration to stop Trump's executive order against the [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1925.52s)]
*  firm. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1932.52s)]
*  In a legal filing, the hundreds of firms wrote that Trump's crackdown on Perkins Coie and [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1933.52s)]
*  the entire industry, quote, poses a grave threat to our system of constitutional governance [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1939.52s)]
*  and to the rule of law itself. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1946.52s)]
*  But many of the country's biggest and most profitable firms refused to sign the briefing, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1952.52s)]
*  including Thomas's former firm, Skadden Arps. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1959.52s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1969.52s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1977.52s)]
*  A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to bring back a migrant it mistakenly deported [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1980.52s)]
*  to a notorious prison in El Salvador by tonight, something the White House said in response [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1986.52s)]
*  that it has little power to do. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1992.52s)]
*  That prompted the judge to declare that the administration's conduct, quote, shocks the [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=1995.52s)]
*  conscience. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2001.52s)]
*  But instead of trying to fix its error, the White House has instead punished a government [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2002.52s)]
*  lawyer who acknowledged the deportation was done by mistake by placing him on administrative [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2008.52s)]
*  leave over the weekend. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2014.52s)]
*  And [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2016.52s)]
*  Large scale protests against President Trump and his agenda were held in cities and towns [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2017.52s)]
*  across the United States over the weekend, attracting hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2023.52s)]
*  Donald Trump has got to go. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2030.52s)]
*  Participants said they were marching to oppose Trump's policies toward federal workers, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2033.52s)]
*  public education, immigration, tariffs and public health. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2038.52s)]
*  And to fight back against Elon Musk's Department of Government efficiency. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2043.52s)]
*  Speakers at the rallies, including former Republican Congressman Eric Swalwell, said [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2049.52s)]
*  that Trump has become a disaster for the country and its finances. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2054.52s)]
*  As you stand here right now, we have gone from a Trump slump to a Trump train wreck. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2059.52s)]
*  Our 401ks are 201ks. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2069.52s)]
*  Our costs at Walmart, Home Depot and Target are going up. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2074.52s)]
*  And where is Donald Trump? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2079.52s)]
*  He's golfing. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2082.52s)]
*  So to Donald Trump I say, get your ass off the golf course and face the people. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2imFBaRbXww&t=2084.52s)]
