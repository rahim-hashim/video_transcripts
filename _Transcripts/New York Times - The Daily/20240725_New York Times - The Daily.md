# The Harris Campaign Is Born
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS1WaqNrMzM)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  Over the past 48 hours, as the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris went from
*  theoretical to inevitable, she delivered the first glimpse of what her campaign would look
*  like and sound like over the next 100 days.
*  My colleague, Reed Epstein, on what exactly we've learned from her debut.
*  It's Thursday, July 25th.
*  Reed, it has been just one day since you were on the show, but that's a lifetime in this
*  presidential campaign.
*  So just to start, catch us up on what's happened to the Vice President's candidacy since you
*  and I last spoke.
*  Well, it seems like every few hours that the Harris campaign announced, she's shattered some
*  other fundraising record.
*  The cash and the calls are flooding in for Vice President Kamala Harris.
*  The latest number on Wednesday morning was that she'd raised $126 million since the campaign
*  launched on Sunday.
*  In just three days.
*  In less than three days.
*  On her first full day in the race, the Vice President securing the support of the more
*  than 1,976 delegates she would need to win the Democratic nomination.
*  You know, we have seen the entire Democratic Party embrace her.
*  So now that the process has played out from the grassroots bottom up, we are here today
*  to throw our support behind Vice President Kamala Harris.
*  The only holdouts in elected office when we last spoke were the Democratic leaders of
*  the House and Senate, Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer of New York.
*  They have since endorsed her.
*  The memeification of the Harris campaign went into overdrive Sunday when singer Charlie
*  XCX tweeted, Kamala is brat.
*  And we've also seen sort of a viral onslaught.
*  Mother has arrived.
*  We need you to be mamala of the country.
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?
*  And she's been part of the culture almost immediately in a way that Barack Obama did
*  in 2008.
*  Democrats everywhere are feeling the Kamala momentum.
*  It's a powerful thing for a Democratic political candidate.
*  And it's something that Joe Biden never had.
*  So at this point, Reid, Harris has the money, the delegates and the memes.
*  And the question has been what would be the message?
*  You know, that's the question we'd all been asking.
*  And we first started to get our answers on Tuesday afternoon when she traveled to the
*  Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, Wisconsin for her first rally as the Democratic de
*  facto nominee.
*  West Allis is a swing city in a swing state and the part of the country where she will
*  have to do well if she is going to defeat Donald Trump in November.
*  This was an event that had already been on the books for her before Biden stepped aside
*  when she was running as the vice presidential candidate.
*  Once she became the presidential candidate, they had to move it to a larger venue.
*  It wound up being in a 3800 seat high school gymnasium.
*  And it drew attendees from out of state to come see her, which was really not something
*  that ever happened for Joe Biden.
*  So when I tuned in to watch Harris speak on Tuesday afternoon, I wanted to see what her
*  message was going to be and how it looked and how she presented herself as the presidential
*  candidate, because it wasn't just important what she said, but really how she said it
*  and what the campaign wanted her to look like saying it.
*  Okay, so take us to this rally and this speech that Harris gives in this high school gymnasium.
*  You know, the first thing you noticed was the crowd, which was much bigger than any
*  Joe Biden event on this campaign and very loud.
*  Please welcome Governor Tony Evers.
*  You could see watching the warmup speakers that there was more noise in the room than
*  there had been for any Biden event.
*  I love all of you.
*  Thank you, West Endless.
*  Our colleague who was in the press area was saying that his ears hurt.
*  Even before Harris took the stage, there were women in the audience with homemade
*  glasses with coconuts taped to them.
*  Coconuts is sort of part of the meme language around Harris.
*  Right, comes from a speech in which she talks about how her mom always asked her
*  and her siblings, did you fall out of a coconut tree?
*  Yeah, and so this was really a moment of collective enthusiasm for Democrats that they had not
*  participated in in more than four years.
*  And now it is my distinct honor to introduce the first woman elected vice president of
*  the United States and the next president of the United States, Kamala Harris.
*  Harris comes to the stage and the crowd is deafening.
*  You could tell even watching on TV how loud it was.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  And she starts with her effectively taking the torch from Joe Biden.
*  So Milwaukee, I want to start by saying a few words and I could really speak at length,
*  but a few words about our incredible president, Joe Biden.
*  She says that it's been an honor to work with him and to serve with him.
*  Joe's legacy of accomplishment over his entire career and over the past three and a half years
*  is unmatched in modern history.
*  She says that he's done more in one term than most presidents have done in two and talks about how
*  she and other Democrats are grateful for his career of service to the country.
*  And it is my great honor to have Joe Biden's endorsement in this race.
*  Right.
*  As I watched that read, I saw a very new nominee navigating a pretty delicate situation, which is
*  she wants to project gratitude to Biden and respect for him while also starting to turn
*  the page away from him.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's tricky because everyone in the party and in the country has lived through,
*  you know, not just the last 48 hours at this point, but the last month since his abysmal
*  debate performance, she has to reconcile all of these feelings and this experience that
*  everyone in the party has gone through with Joe Biden while also pivoting to what's next
*  and placing herself at the center of the party as its candidate to run for president.
*  Before I was elected United States Senator, I was elected attorney general of the state
*  of California and I was a courtroom prosecutor before then.
*  So what she does next is she starts to try to define herself, which she does in opposition
*  to Donald Trump.
*  I took on perpetrators of all kinds.
*  She speaks about the types of people that she investigated and prosecuted.
*  Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers.
*  And the capstone of this section of her speech is she says,
*  So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type.
*  I know Donald Trump's type.
*  And it's a thing that Joe Biden never could really do because his life didn't set him up
*  to be quite so oppositional to Trump's, not to mention his age and diminished capacity
*  as a public speaker made him incapable of delivering that kind of message.
*  Mm hmm.
*  And Wisconsin, this campaign is also about two different visions.
*  And so what we hear next from her.
*  Where we are focused on the future, the other focused on the past.
*  Is this real contrast between not just herself and Trump, but a policy contrast between
*  Democrats and Republicans.
*  We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity to make a difference.
*  We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.
*  And here is where you get sort of the traditional laundry list of policies from her.
*  Where every worker has the freedom to join a union.
*  That all sort of touch the erogenous zones of Democratic voters and consultants because
*  they frankly poll very well.
*  Where every person has affordable health care, affordable child care, and paid family leave.
*  All of these phrases are things that you hear Democratic candidates up and down the ballot
*  talk about, but Biden just could not quite say them in the right order in a way that
*  people believed.
*  But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward.
*  And then she delves into the Trump policies, which Democrats have been begging voters to
*  listen to for much of the past year.
*  He and his extreme project 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class.
*  Like we know we got to take this seriously.
*  Can you believe they put that thing in writing?
*  She talks about project 2025, which is a 900 page policy document that some of Trump's
*  allies have put together in anticipation of him becoming the president again.
*  And compares that to the vision that Democrats have for the future.
*  She talks about gun control laws, background checks, and the key part of this.
*  And we who believe in reproductive freedom.
*  Is when she talks about abortion.
*  Will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions
*  about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.
*  Now.
*  Which is another thing that Biden was very uncomfortable doing.
*  He rarely said the word abortion.
*  He would always couch it in language about choice or reproductive freedom or whatnot.
*  And that was because we sensed his Catholic religion kind of made him reluctant to talk
*  in an overly supportive way about abortion.
*  Right?
*  Right.
*  And he was and is an 81 year old Catholic white man who, you know, grew up in a different
*  time when the politics on abortion were different.
*  And Harris is much more of a creature of modern day democratic politics on this issue.
*  She's able to speak about abortion in a clearer and more concise way than Biden has ever been able to.
*  I'm curious to read how in this speech, Harris touched on or in any way acknowledged
*  the historic nature of her candidacy.
*  Something very much on people's minds right now.
*  Yeah, I mean, this was another thing to watch for because clearly this is part of the undertone
*  of all the enthusiasm about her.
*  She would be the first woman president.
*  She would be the first black woman president.
*  She would be the first South Asian president.
*  And she doesn't have to articulate those things herself.
*  The shoulders on which we stand, generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom.
*  And now, Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands.
*  But what she talked about in the speech was about standing on the shoulders of generations
*  of Americans before her leading the fight to freedom.
*  You know, she's talking about abolitionists and suffragists.
*  But she doesn't have to use those words because the people in the Democratic Party that she's
*  talking to know what she means.
*  We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will make sure every American has the ability
*  to cast their ballot and have it counted.
*  And that it is their responsibility to win the election to continue to advance civil
*  rights and voting rights, not just in Wisconsin, but across the country.
*  So she's placing herself in a continuum that dates back centuries for racial justice and
*  justice for women.
*  Right.
*  But she's talking about it in the context of voting rights, which is a very important
*  issue locally in Wisconsin, where they've had innumerable fights about voting access
*  over the last 15 years.
*  And so it works both as a line speaking to Democrats across the country and a line that
*  the people in the room will understand applies to them specifically.
*  Right. And it feels like as with Harris's ability to speak as a prosecutor when she
*  talks about Trump, her ability to talk about racial justice is something that Joe Biden
*  cannot do as naturally because his biography isn't the same as hers.
*  Yeah. And this like abortion, too, is just much more personal for her than it ever has
*  been for Biden.
*  But how does this speech ultimately end?
*  I mean, it ends like it began with contrast between her and Trump.
*  So Wisconsin, ultimately, in this election, we each face a question.
*  What kind of country do we want to live in?
*  She asks the audience and the listeners if they want freedom, compassion and the rule
*  of law or chaos, fear and hate, which she ascribes to Trump.
*  And here's the beauty of this moment.
*  We each have the power to answer that question.
*  The power is with the people.
*  We each have the power to answer that question.
*  And she reminds Democrats that are watching that they have a limited time to make this
*  reality that she's envisioning happen.
*  So Wisconsin, today I ask you, are you ready to get to work?
*  Do we believe in freedom?
*  Do we believe in opportunity?
*  Do we believe in the promise of America?
*  And are we ready to fight for it?
*  And when we fight, we win.
*  God bless you.
*  And it ends in this big finish and another raucous ovation for her as she walks off the
*  stage to Beyonce.
*  When the speech was over, Reed, I wrote down a bunch of adjectives really quickly on my
*  computer in my little notes file, you know, and the words were, I'm just going to read
*  them to you, punchy, loud, lucid, energetic, tight, right?
*  And not to beat a dead horse here, but those are not words that apply to a Joe Biden speech.
*  Yeah, you know, when the speech ended, I got a text from a person who is helping to elect
*  Joe Biden and now is helping to elect Kamala Harris, who just expressed their own astonishment
*  at what it was like to watch a campaign speech where they didn't have to worry about the
*  candidate falling down and about how much their own expectations had been diminished
*  by years of watching Biden.
*  And seeing a candidate who brought just a totally different energy, it gave Democrats
*  a reason to be hopeful and a reason to be proud of their candidate in a way that they
*  hadn't had since the beginning of the Biden campaign.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Reed, I want to talk about what wasn't in this first Kamala Harris rally as de facto
*  nominee and what that may reveal about the challenges that she faces despite all the
*  enthusiasm, all the money, all the endorsements, all the delegates.
*  Right. She didn't talk about two of the biggest challenges she's going to face.
*  And frankly, were two of the biggest challenges that Joe Biden faced the economy, which includes
*  inflation and immigration at the border.
*  Right. Let's start with economy and immigration. I mean, I noticed that Harris did not mention the
*  word economy or for that matter, inflation once in the speech.
*  So, you know, Michael, the first rule of campaigning is you want to talk about issues that are good
*  for you and not issues that are good for your opponent.
*  And that's what this was about.
*  So to do that, she talked about abortion rights and gun control and comparing herself to Donald
*  Trump and avoided issues that polls show voters prefer Republicans and Trump on, like
*  immigration and the economy.
*  And that really is the calculus that went into the issues that she addressed and the
*  issues that she didn't address.
*  Well, let's talk about why she wouldn't want to talk about the economy at all, because as we've
*  talked about on the show, Reid, you know, there's a lot that happened under Biden in the American
*  economy that is pretty good for the Democrats.
*  Unemployment is really low.
*  There's been a lot of job creation, especially if you take the data back to the moment Biden
*  takes office after the pandemic.
*  But there is, of course, the problem of inflation going up in part because of Biden's
*  response to the inflation, all that stimulus spending.
*  So you're saying that there's no version of a threaded needle that Harris wants to even
*  attempt when it comes to the economy.
*  Well, they do have an economic story to tell.
*  The problem is voters don't believe it.
*  You know, we've seen this over and over again when Joe Biden tried to tell his economic
*  record that voters just did not buy it.
*  And so this is an issue where, you know, the campaign is operating at some level without
*  regard to the actual situation on the ground and more to what voters feel about it.
*  Got it.
*  And voters never really forgave Biden for the inflation that the country saw as Biden
*  helped drive the country out of the pandemic.
*  And that has stuck to him ever since.
*  Even though the rate of inflation has slowed substantially, the prices are not below where
*  they were four years ago at the start of the pandemic.
*  And that no matter what the Biden administration, Biden campaign have tried to do to explain
*  that to people, they just never bought into it.
*  And inflation remains a very difficult issue for Democrats to explain and to campaign on
*  because they started so far behind.
*  And frankly, voters have said they do not believe them on this.
*  Right.
*  So nuance may not be her friend when it comes to talking about the economy.
*  And so she'll just not talk about it as much as she can.
*  Let's turn to immigration and the reason why the vice president didn't talk about it in
*  a speech and how she will eventually talk about it if she decides she needs to.
*  And I suspect at some point she will need to.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, eventually she will talk about it.
*  It's certain to come up if she and Donald Trump wind up on a debate stage together.
*  She will be asked about it in interviews should she submit to them.
*  But I do not anticipate big applause lines for her on immigration in these
*  some speeches at her campaign rallies.
*  It's just a fraught issue that is not great for Democrats.
*  It often is without regard to any of the data on the ground about whether border crossings
*  have slowed or any sort of metric that you want to take that might show an improving
*  situation at the border for Biden is just not something that has sunk in with voters.
*  And she doesn't have very much time left in this campaign to explain that.
*  And so what we have seen in the early returns of her as a presidential candidate is not
*  addressing it.
*  Well, let's assume that Kamala Harris keeps giving this stump speech and keeps energizing
*  room after room after room of Democrats and maybe even some moderate Republicans who show
*  up and are very interested in her because they have concerns about Trump.
*  And she navigates her way around immigration and the economy in this 100 and so days left
*  in the campaign.
*  Perhaps that will end up being enough.
*  You know, Michael, as energizing as this speech was and as jazzed as Democrats around the
*  country were by it, she still faces a ton of challenges as the presidential candidate.
*  It's not just the message.
*  It's getting the message out.
*  What do you mean?
*  Well, the Biden campaign was built around an 81 year old candidate who, to this point,
*  had given campaign rallies once or twice a week.
*  He was in his Delaware home every weekend and it was not a very high energy operation.
*  It's not built for a 59 year old candidate who wants to get out there as much as she can
*  and frankly needs to get out there as much as she can to introduce herself to voters
*  around the country.
*  So she needs to repeat that kind of speech multiple times a week from now until November.
*  If you remember when Barack Obama was campaigning for president, he would do three states a day
*  sometimes.
*  And that's the kind of pace that they need to ramp up to for her.
*  And there's no evidence to date because just because they haven't done it that the Biden
*  campaign as constituted now is able to pull that off.
*  I just want to be clear on what you're saying that Kamala Harris is a different candidate
*  from Biden, different metabolism.
*  And based on where things are in the polls, she needs to be doing a lot more than Biden
*  ever was if she perhaps could get to something like two or three events a day.
*  But the worry is that the Biden campaign is literally not equipped with the people and
*  the protocols to make that happen because putting on that many events a day is logistically
*  just an enormous undertaking that a campaign either is or isn't designed for.
*  Yeah.
*  And I don't want to besmirch the people who work for the Biden campaign of incapable of
*  doing this.
*  I'm just saying that they haven't done it yet.
*  We haven't seen that they're able to do it.
*  They may well be capable of doing it.
*  But it will be new to them.
*  And given where they are in the polls right now, the Harris campaign has to get her out
*  there.
*  They have to get as much visibility on her from voters in the key states and get her
*  in different TV markets in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Milwaukee and Atlanta.
*  And sometimes many of those places in the same day so that people can hear her message
*  both about her own campaign and about Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  It's interesting that you mentioned those swing states because that's where I want to
*  turn now.
*  We've been talking about what was in the speech, what wasn't in the speech, the logistics of
*  getting that message out.
*  But a really important question I have to think is what is the Harris as nominee plan
*  to win the swing voter in the swing states that you just mentioned, the Wisconsin's,
*  Michigan's, Pennsylvania's, given how forceful a message Donald Trump and JD Vance are
*  delivering on that front.
*  Right.
*  They're talking about economic and social populism, tariffs, China ripping off America,
*  the forgotten working man.
*  Those are all directed to those swing voters in the Midwest, in those states.
*  Harris is telling a story for sure in this first couple of days.
*  But it's not that story.
*  It's a story about how she is good and looking to the future and Trump is bad and taking
*  the country backward.
*  And so that leaves me wondering whether there is a strong winning message from Harris that
*  is emerging or will soon emerge for this key group of voters in these key states.
*  Well, we are going to see as she does more and more events.
*  One thing that you hear from her people in her campaign is sort of a subtle idea that she may
*  change the demographics of who is a democratic voter.
*  We've already seen an extraordinary amount of excitement for her among black women.
*  There were some 50,000 people on a Zoom call Sunday night, an organizing call for a group
*  called Win with Black Women.
*  We've seen some evidence that she performs better among black and Latino voters, that
*  young people are more interested in coming to vote now that she's on the ticket than Biden.
*  And so that may alter the dynamics a little bit from where they were with Joe Biden on
*  the ticket.
*  And so she may not need to engage on issues like tariffs and some of the things that Trump is
*  talking about as an issue stance if she's able to energize voters who might have stayed home
*  or not been interested in Biden, if she can build a little bit more out of that Obama coalition
*  and still hold on to some of these moderate voters who are repelled by Trump.
*  That is a recipe that can lead a democratic ticket to win.
*  It's not a guarantee.
*  There is some fear that she may not do as well with older white voters that were partial to Biden.
*  And so we are going to see as more polling results come in how it changes with her atop
*  the ticket from Joe Biden.
*  Got it.
*  And that is the playbook.
*  It sounds like we saw Kamala Harris begin to pursue with this speech that we've spent
*  this episode talking to you about.
*  She's fighting on different demographic terrain than Trump.
*  That's deliberate.
*  In other words, we shouldn't spend too much time thinking about what wasn't in this speech
*  because what was in the speech is quite revealing about strategy as well.
*  You know, Michael, the Republican ticket, Donald Trump and JD Vance are making an economic
*  and cultural argument to their voters.
*  And the polling suggests that they are winning at the moment.
*  But Harris is making her own cultural argument to voters.
*  And it's about young people and people of color and being cool and hip in a way that
*  Barack Obama was when he first ran for office.
*  And she's trying to recreate that energy from 2008.
*  And the early return suggests that she is a reasonable facsimile of that.
*  It remains to be seen how long she and her team can sustain that.
*  And it's going to be a lot of work for them because they are losing at the moment.
*  And Trump has built in advantages in the Electoral College.
*  And so they will need to get a lot of these people who had been sour on Joe Biden to come
*  out and vote for her.
*  And we'll see if they're able to do that.
*  But so far in the first couple days, she by all accounts is off to a terrific start.
*  She has raised an enormous amount of money.
*  She has people in the party excited about her.
*  They are collectively moved on from Joe Biden without any evident bitterness.
*  And she has united the party in a rapid amount of time to move forward into the general election,
*  which is quite the feat given where everything was just a couple of days ago.
*  Over here.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  My fellow Americans, I'm speaking to you tonight from behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office.
*  In an 11-minute speech on Wednesday night, President Biden explained his decision to
*  end his campaign for re-election and endorse Kamala Harris as his replacement,
*  saying that it was necessary to pass the torch to a new generation.
*  You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life.
*  There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices.
*  And that time and place is now.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister of the State of Israel.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for giving me the profound honor of addressing this
*  great citadel of democracy for the fourth time.
*  In a speech on Wednesday to a joint meeting of Congress, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  forcefully defended his country's military campaign in Gaza, praised both President Biden
*  and former President Trump for their support, and described Israel's deadly war against Hamas
*  as a necessary fight between good and evil.
*  This is not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between barbarism and civilization.
*  It's a clash between those who glorify death and those who sanctify life.
*  Netanyahu pointedly scolded pro-Palestinian protesters in the United States,
*  thousands of whom demonstrated against his visit in Washington.
*  Incredibly many anti-Israel protesters, many choose to stand with evil.
*  They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers. They should be ashamed of themselves.
*  And he warned that Israel's battle against Hamas and the country that finances it, Iran,
*  was America's battle as well.
*  My friends, if you remember one thing, one thing from the speech, remember this.
*  Our enemies are your enemies. Our fight is your fight. And our victory will be your victory.
