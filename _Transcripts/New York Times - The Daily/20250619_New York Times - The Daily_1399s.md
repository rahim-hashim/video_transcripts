# An Interview With Trump's Border Czar Tom Homan
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA)
*  Hi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=0.0s)]
*  Ready to go. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1.0s)]
*  Over the past several weeks, federal agents have mounted increasingly intense immigration [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=6.9s)]
*  raids at workplaces and in neighborhoods across the country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=11.44s)]
*  They've been met with intense pushback from politicians, protesters, and even big business. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=14.72s)]
*  Today, we talked to the president's border czar, Tom Holman, about his deportation strategy [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=20.6s)]
*  and why the Trump administration is only just getting started. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=25.98s)]
*  From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Ketroff, new host here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=29.26s)]
*  And this is The Daily. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=33.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=35.54s)]
*  I'm ready when you're ready. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=37.22s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=40.900000000000006s)]
*  Oh, no problem. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=42.42s)]
*  Should I call you Mr. Holman, border czar Holman, czar? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=43.86s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=48.660000000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=50.14s)]
*  I think I'll call you Mr. Holman then. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=51.14s)]
*  There we go. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Holman, we're speaking to you at a really interesting and important moment in the work [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=54.54s)]
*  that you've overseen for the president, which is securing the border. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=59.46s)]
*  You've done that very successfully. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  You've brought border crossings down to historic lows. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=64.06s)]
*  So what we want to do today is talk to you about the second half of that work, which [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=67.98s)]
*  is detaining and deporting illegal immigrants living and working inside of the country. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=72.34s)]
*  Because that's where you've bumped into some real challenges, some wider pushback, and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=78.42s)]
*  protests, most notably in Los Angeles, but also elsewhere. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=84.5s)]
*  Can you just start by talking us through your goals here? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=88.18s)]
*  Are you trying to deport every single person who's here illegally? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=92.3s)]
*  And if so, why? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=96.74s)]
*  Well, look, we're nice from laws, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=98.22s)]
*  We got enforceable laws. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=100.14s)]
*  Entering this country legally is a crime. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=101.14s)]
*  And we need to enforce those laws because if we don't, we send a message to the whole [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=103.9s)]
*  world, you can go ahead and enter this country legally. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  It's a crime, but don't worry about it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=110.94s)]
*  I just want to be clear, Mr. Homan, when the Trump administration says we're deporting [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=112.42s)]
*  criminal aliens, that means everyone who's here illegally. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=135.26s)]
*  Sanctuary cities does not allow us to get the illegal alien criminal in the safety [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=170.1s)]
*  and security of a jail. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=173.98s)]
*  Now we got to send a whole team of five or six agents for officer safety reasons to find [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=175.42s)]
*  that public safety threat. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=180.54s)]
*  And when we find them, many times they're with others, others who are in the country [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=181.54s)]
*  illegally may not be a public safety threat, but are in the country illegally, they're [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=185.7s)]
*  going to be arrested too. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=189.26s)]
*  We're not going to turn a blind eye to illegal immigration. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=190.26s)]
*  I want to get to sanctuary cities a little bit more in a minute. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=192.38s)]
*  I do want to ask you about your goals here. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=195.86s)]
*  The number that you and White House adviser Stephen Miller have put out there as a target [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=198.5s)]
*  is 3,000 arrests a day, which would be about a million arrests a year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=202.46s)]
*  That is an extraordinary number, a really ambitious goal. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=206.66s)]
*  Are you satisfied with your numbers thus far? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=210.22s)]
*  Well, I don't think 3,000 is overly ambitious. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=212.38s)]
*  We've added more operational teams on the streets. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=215.5s)]
*  We got like a thousand teams operating every day across this country. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=217.42000000000002s)]
*  We've added other agencies, the FBI, DEA, US Marshals. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=220.96s)]
*  Other agencies are augmenting these operations. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=224.98s)]
*  So we think with additional teams, additional resources we provided, 3,000 days is a reasonable number. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=227.46s)]
*  Let's talk about the raids that we've seen so far, Mr. Homan. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=233.06s)]
*  Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE invited our colleagues to one of these raids. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=237.38s)]
*  We featured it on the show. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=240.78s)]
*  These are raids that have increasingly expanded into workplaces, into neighborhoods. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=242.7s)]
*  We've seen ICE agents at construction sites, home depots, car washes. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=247.62s)]
*  Can you just explain why you're focusing on work sites? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=251.72s)]
*  Well, look, no one hires an illegal alien on the goodness of their heart. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=255.16s)]
*  They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, and undercut their [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=259.28s)]
*  competition as US citizen employees. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=261.76s)]
*  I've experienced this myself. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=263.76s)]
*  Let me tell you a real quick story. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=264.76s)]
*  I put a new roof in my home several years ago. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=266.76s)]
*  I had to call six companies before I got a company to guarantee me a legal workforce. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=269.0s)]
*  And the father and son showed up. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=274.04s)]
*  And the father told me this story. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=275.88s)]
*  I had 20 US citizen employees. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=278.16s)]
*  And I'll pay them 20 bucks an hour to get on the roof. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't win a contract because all these other companies that illegal aliens are paying [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  them $7 an hour to get on the roof. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=286.44s)]
*  I couldn't win a contract. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=288.36s)]
*  So I laid off all my US citizen employees, and now me and my son just do repairs. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  That happens across this country every day by the thousands. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=294.32000000000005s)]
*  So work site enforcement is important. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=297.40000000000003s)]
*  Work site enforcement is the number one place we find victims of sex trafficking and forced [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  labor trafficking. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=304.68s)]
*  And second of all, we got to hold these companies responsible because they're undercutting US [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=305.68s)]
*  citizen employment. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=310.64s)]
*  They're driving down wages. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=311.64s)]
*  And it's against the law to hire illegal aliens. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=312.64s)]
*  So we got to enforce the law. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=314.6s)]
*  So again, if they let us into jail, we'd have less agents in the neighborhoods. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=315.76s)]
*  So I've said for months now, if sanctuary cities want to keep playing this game, we're [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  going to flood the zone. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=325.48s)]
*  We're going to flood the zone with agents in their neighborhood. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=326.48s)]
*  We're going to flood the zone with agents on work sites because we're going to find [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=329.04s)]
*  that person. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=332.48s)]
*  You want to put roadblocks up? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=333.48s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=334.48s)]
*  So if we have to add more resource and do more, that's what we're going to do. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  You had said that your priority was public safety, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  And that you're prioritizing criminals. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  At the workplace raids, are you rounding up just the people who are there who have criminal [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=343.16s)]
*  records or is it anyone you think is undocumented? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=347.6s)]
*  Is that distinction important to you? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=351.04s)]
*  We are not going to turn our back to somebody that we found is illegally in the United States. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  They're here in violation of federal law. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=358.44s)]
*  These are immigration officers whose job is to enforce that law. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=360.64000000000004s)]
*  And so we're going to arrest that illegally. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=365.36s)]
*  The instructions are clear to ICE officers. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=366.36s)]
*  You find someone that's in the country illegally, you will take proper action. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  The officers have discretion on the arrests and what we do with the mattress. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  But there are going to be put in proceedings. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=374.52000000000004s)]
*  That's what the law requires, that we will put them in proceedings at a minimum. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=376.92s)]
*  You mentioned this issue that you're having with these sanctuary cities. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=380.64000000000004s)]
*  You said part of the reason that you have to do these raids is that these cities are [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=384.48s)]
*  not letting you into the jails to arrest the criminals that are there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=388.92s)]
*  If those cities let you into the jails, would you stop doing the workplace raids? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=393.8s)]
*  What I'm saying is more agents in the jail means less agents on the street. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=398.6s)]
*  It's simple math. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=403.8s)]
*  Back when we were in Rikers Island, we had 10 or 12 agents on Rikers Island in New York [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=405.8s)]
*  City. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=409.44s)]
*  We arrest hundreds of people a week with a handful of agents. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=410.44s)]
*  But when they release them, it means we've got to send more people. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=413.0s)]
*  So of course, if I had a choice, I'd much rather be in a jail because it's safer for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=414.84000000000003s)]
*  the neighborhood, safer for the officer and safer for the public. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=418.64s)]
*  But let me be clear. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=422.28s)]
*  Even if they let us in the jail, every jail across the country doesn't mean we stop all [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=424.28s)]
*  worksite enforcement operations. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=428.12s)]
*  We prioritize those too. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=429.84s)]
*  We just don't say, well, let's go to this work site just for something to do. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  No, it's based on a lot of evidence gathered, a lot of information on who we hit. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  So it's never going to go away. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=438.8s)]
*  It will certainly decrease because we have more agents assigned to the jails. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  Got it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=443.15999999999997s)]
*  So you would be operating on both of those fronts either way. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  So Trump won the election on the promise to do mass deportations. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=447.24s)]
*  But I want to talk about the polls here because while polls show a majority of Americans support [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=452.52s)]
*  deporting violent criminals, they don't support deporting people who have been here for a [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=458.48s)]
*  while, who are deeply ingrained in their communities. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=463.8s)]
*  What do you say to people who say, look, we voted for deporting all the violent criminals, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=467.6s)]
*  but not for this more sweeping campaign to deport everyone here illegally? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=472.76s)]
*  The president was clear on his campaign promise to secure the border, which have the most [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=477.64s)]
*  secure border in lifetime and running a massive deportation operation. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=481.44s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=485.48s)]
*  If people don't like what ICE is doing, then call your senator, call your congressman. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=486.48s)]
*  ICE isn't making this up. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=490.84s)]
*  We're enforcing the laws enacted by Congress and signed by president. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=491.84s)]
*  You know, everybody attacking ICE right now. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=494.84s)]
*  And here's what I find interesting. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=496.52s)]
*  If you don't like what ICE officers out there doing right now, why are you on Capitol Hill [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=498.12s)]
*  asking for immigration changes? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=500.8s)]
*  Why aren't you protesting immigration court? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=502.74s)]
*  Because ICE is doing two things. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=505.82s)]
*  They're enforcing laws enacted by Congress and they get funded to do. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=507.02s)]
*  And number two, they're working on immigration. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=510.86s)]
*  A federal judge who ordered this person to be removed, so they're executing the order [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=512.66s)]
*  of removals. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=516.74s)]
*  ICE is just doing the job. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=517.74s)]
*  So if you don't like what they're doing, spend time processing Capitol Hill because ICE is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=518.74s)]
*  simply enforcing laws as they're required to do under federal statute. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=523.02s)]
*  And look, the innocent illegal immigration, the non-criminals that just entered the country [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=527.7s)]
*  illegally for a better life. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=532.46s)]
*  When that happens, over almost the border patrol, the national security is gone because [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=534.1s)]
*  again, Fentanyl comes across killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=538.3000000000001s)]
*  Sex trafficking increased tenfold. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=542.86s)]
*  All those bad things happen because of innocent illegal immigration, people want to call it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=544.74s)]
*  But while everybody's fighting in defense of illegal aliens, there are millions of people [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=548.9000000000001s)]
*  standing in line, taking their tests, doing their back-cross investigation, paying their [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=553.22s)]
*  fees, doing things the right way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=557.86s)]
*  Let me add this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=559.6999999999999s)]
*  In addition, there are thousands and thousands of people in this world who really are escaping [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=560.6999999999999s)]
*  fear and persecution from their home government. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=565.9399999999999s)]
*  They're sitting in the backseat because all the cheaters have overwhelmed the system and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=568.4599999999999s)]
*  pushed the system back for several years. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=572.9399999999999s)]
*  We have to be a nation of laws. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=575.2199999999999s)]
*  We have to tell the whole, we've got to start to mess with the whole world. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=576.9799999999999s)]
*  There's a right way and wrong way to come here. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=579.8199999999999s)]
*  You can still make an asylum claim, but you got to do it the right way. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=581.3399999999999s)]
*  You don't do it by entering the country illegally. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=584.78s)]
*  What I hear you saying is that basically the people who are not violent criminals, whose [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=586.8199999999999s)]
*  crime is to cross illegally, that that is related to public safety because of the need [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=590.18s)]
*  to kind of be this nation of laws. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=596.6999999999999s)]
*  I'm just not sure a lot of people see it that way because we are seeing people talk to their [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=598.78s)]
*  representatives. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=605.3s)]
*  We're seeing these really big protests, Mr. Homan, which I know you've seen. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=606.3s)]
*  We've seen people go on the streets to voice their concerns about this. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=609.14s)]
*  I think what they are trying to communicate is that they don't want this. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=614.86s)]
*  I wonder what you say to those protesters. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=620.22s)]
*  We don't pick and choose what we enforce. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=622.98s)]
*  We're here to enforce the law. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=624.78s)]
*  Illegal immigration is not the answer because again, people don't understand there's a whole [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=626.14s)]
*  ugly underbelly of illegal immigration. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=629.34s)]
*  I've done this since 1984. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=631.14s)]
*  I've sat in back of a tractor trailer with 19 dead aliens who baked to death, including [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=633.66s)]
*  a five-year-old little boy. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=639.5s)]
*  I've talked to the little girls as young as nine that were raped multiple times by members [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=640.7800000000001s)]
*  of the cartel. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=644.9000000000001s)]
*  I have seen babies getting CPR in the river. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=645.9000000000001s)]
*  I've seen enough dead children, enough dead aliens in my career that it's created the [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  person you're talking to today. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=654.1800000000001s)]
*  I wish people could wear my shoes for the last 40 years and see what I've seen and they [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=655.86s)]
*  would agree with me. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=659.74s)]
*  Illegal migration is not a victimless crime. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=661.26s)]
*  A secure border saves lives. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=663.98s)]
*  No, I hear you. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  I spent a lot of time reporting from Mexico and reporting at the border and I can completely [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=667.42s)]
*  understand how having a secure border affects this trafficking that you are concerned about [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=671.9799999999999s)]
*  and that you've seen over the course of your career. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=677.42s)]
*  I think the question that people who are on the streets are asking is how does breaking [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  up a family or uprooting a person who has been here for a long time, who is not seen [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=684.8199999999999s)]
*  as causing a lot of problems, how does that affect the problems that you're talking about? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=690.5s)]
*  We've got to look at the results. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=695.4599999999999s)]
*  Look at the data from ICE. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=696.5400000000001s)]
*  Right now, just under 130,000 arrests, close to 75% of them have a criminal record of pending [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=698.1800000000001s)]
*  criminal charges. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=703.02s)]
*  We are prioritizing it the right way. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=704.02s)]
*  But we aren't going to send a message that it's okay to be here illegally. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=705.9000000000001s)]
*  Just don't commit a crime, you're okay. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=710.22s)]
*  Because that just brings more. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=711.94s)]
*  Before we started bailing and wandering out, we had to plug the hole, we plugged the hole. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=713.38s)]
*  But we've got to send a message, there's a right wing wandering thing that's going to [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=716.7800000000001s)]
*  come to this country. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=719.6600000000001s)]
*  Because if we say, starting today, we're only going to arrest illegal aliens convicted of [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=720.6600000000001s)]
*  a crime. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=724.7800000000001s)]
*  If you're in the house, don't worry about it, we're not looking for you. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=725.8199999999999s)]
*  You're saying that would send the wrong message. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=727.62s)]
*  So the entire world wants to come to the greatest nation on earth? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=729.5799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=732.4599999999999s)]
*  Sir, I just want to talk about just tactics. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=733.4599999999999s)]
*  We've seen some Democratic officials who are showing up to protest and they're at times [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=735.42s)]
*  getting detained. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=740.06s)]
*  Most recently, we saw a mayoral candidate in New York get arrested by ICE at an immigration [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=741.06s)]
*  courthouse. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=746.26s)]
*  Can you just explain that to me? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=747.26s)]
*  What's the message there? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=749.02s)]
*  It does feel more aggressive than what we've seen. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=750.5s)]
*  We've been clear from day one. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=753.6999999999999s)]
*  You can protest all you want. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=755.12s)]
*  You cannot like ICE. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=756.98s)]
*  You can hate on Trump. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=758.24s)]
*  You can hate on whatever. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=759.24s)]
*  But you can't cross that line interfering in a lawful, law enforcement operation. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=760.24s)]
*  It's unfortunate. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=765.32s)]
*  These candidates are making a public appearance because they're all looking to get out there [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=766.32s)]
*  and say, look at me, I'm taking on ICE, which is really disgusting, in my opinion. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=771.4s)]
*  Where were they when half a million kids got smuggled into this country and separated from [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=777.2s)]
*  their families? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=780.88s)]
*  Where were they when many of the people were being released to the United States for a [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=781.88s)]
*  proper wedding? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=784.4399999999999s)]
*  Where were they then? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=785.4399999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  Have any of these candidates met with an angel mom and dad whose children were murdered by [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  ill-advised law enforcement? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=789.96s)]
*  I guarantee they haven't. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=790.96s)]
*  What I find disgusting is that any elected candidate or any elected official or any politician, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=791.96s)]
*  why are those who enforce the law the bad guys and those who break the law the victims? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=798.84s)]
*  The whole world's upside down on this. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=803.48s)]
*  The men and women of ICE, who I commanded them, I was the first ICE director, actually [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=805.04s)]
*  came up to the ranks. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=809.32s)]
*  Their mothers and fathers, too. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=810.48s)]

*  They don't hang their heart on the hook at their home when they go to work. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=816.08s)]
*  They go home with terrible, terrible things every day. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=819.2s)]
*  They've seen the worst of the worst. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=821.84s)]
*  Just like me, I just shared a few experiences with you that I've seen. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=823.48s)]
*  These men and women are putting their lives out in line to enforce the law Congress had [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=827.12s)]
*  told them to enforce. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=830.44s)]
*  And they're executing orders issued by federal judges saying that person needs to be arrested [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  and deported. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=836.36s)]
*  That is what they're doing. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=837.36s)]
*  This attempt at attacking ICE and getting on TV, boy, look at me, I'm taking on ICE. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=838.4s)]
*  It's just disgusting. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=843.6s)]
*  The senator in California, he could have had a meeting with the secretary. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=845.4s)]
*  All you guys do is do it the right way. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=848.64s)]
*  This guy running for political office, why didn't he ask for a meeting with ICE? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=850.48s)]
*  He'd meet me after saying, where are you going? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=854.12s)]
*  Where are you taking him? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  I'll meet you there. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=856.32s)]
*  I got questions. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=856.88s)]
*  There's a right way and wrong way to do this country. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=857.88s)]
*  But they're being really aggressive because they're looking for the limelight. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=859.88s)]
*  I can't think of any other reason people would do that. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  It's unprofessional and it's unsafe. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=866.6s)]
*  Can I just ask, do you think there's anything valid about the criticism that ICE is maybe [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=868.6s)]
*  coming in a little more aggressively than is necessary? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=873.64s)]
*  That it's also about potentially intimidation? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=877.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not about intimidation. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=881.12s)]
*  These men and women are under pressure to not only do their job, but to keep themselves [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=882.48s)]
*  and the people around them safe. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=887.36s)]
*  When they arrest an illegal alien, they got to worry about his safety. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=888.6s)]
*  They got to worry about their safety, their partner's safety, and everybody in the surrounding [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=891.5600000000001s)]
*  area's safety. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=894.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm reading a story this morning. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=895.8399999999999s)]
*  California wants to ban ICE officers wearing masks. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=896.8399999999999s)]
*  ICE officers wear masks because they've been doxxed by the thousands. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=900.04s)]
*  Their families have been doxxed. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  ICE officers' pictures have shown up on trees and telephone poles. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=904.68s)]
*  Death threats are sky high. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=907.8s)]
*  I know because I've been doxxed a thousand times myself. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=908.8s)]
*  I accept it when the borders are. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=911.4s)]
*  I don't really care what people think about me. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=913.12s)]
*  The bottom line is these men and women are not only have a dangerous job already, it's [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=914.9599999999999s)]
*  made much more dangerous by the rhetoric, the false rhetoric being pushed out there [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=920.8s)]
*  by a lot of the media and a lot of the open borders advocates. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=924.8399999999999s)]
*  They're doing the best job they can in difficult circumstances. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  I stand by it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=930.76s)]
*  It's not being aggressive. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=931.76s)]
*  It's about being safe and enforcing the law in a difficult situation. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=932.76s)]
*  And you said this isn't about intimidation, that this is about safety for your ICE officers. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm curious though, just in a perfect world for you, does everyone here illegally see [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=941.8s)]
*  what you're doing, see these raids and say, look, that's not how I want to leave the U.S. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  I would rather self-deport. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=954.4799999999999s)]
*  I would rather do this on my own accord. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=956.52s)]
*  Is that the ideal scenario in your mind? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=962.4s)]
*  We spent a lot of money, advertised that in several different languages. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=963.4s)]
*  Work with us. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=968.2399999999999s)]
*  Get your affairs in order, whatever that is. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=969.2399999999999s)]
*  Work with us. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=973.04s)]
*  We'll get you a free airline ticket home and we'll give you a thousand dollars when you [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=974.04s)]
*  land. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=976.04s)]
*  You want to do it that way. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=977.04s)]
*  But the message is, and they should do it that way because if they do it that way, they [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=978.76s)]
*  leave themselves open to opportunity to come back with a visitor's visa, tourist visa. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=983.3199999999999s)]
*  Maybe they have a U.S. citizen child that when they turn of age, they can petition for [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  the parent. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=991.52s)]
*  There's other legal avenues they can take advantage of. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=992.52s)]
*  But if we have to go seek you, we have to go through the formal deportation process, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=994.8s)]
*  there's a statutory bar in federal law in ways from five to 20 years where you can't [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=999.0799999999999s)]
*  come back on any legal program. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1003.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1004.4s)]
*  So it's easier for yourself and work with us and leave and make other opportunities [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1005.4s)]
*  available to you. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1009.78s)]
*  I think my question was really about the kind of images that are coming out of these raids [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1010.78s)]
*  and whether there is a message being sent by the aggressiveness of the approach, which [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1015.28s)]
*  is look, if you don't want to be swept up in one of these raids, go on your own accord. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  And do you see the kind of aggressive tactics as sending a message, sending that message [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1026.0s)]
*  specifically? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1031.44s)]
*  I don't agree with the term aggressive tactics. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1032.44s)]
*  They're doing the same taxes that I've done, starting in 1984. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1034.88s)]
*  ISIS is trying to do the job. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1037.8000000000002s)]
*  So enforcing law is aggressive. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1039.68s)]
*  I disagree with the term aggressive. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1041.8000000000002s)]
*  I think they're doing it in a real professional manner, despite all the hate they're taking, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1043.4s)]
*  all the threats they're taking. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1047.88s)]
*  They're taking extra measures now. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1048.88s)]
*  I'll give you that. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1050.72s)]
*  They're sending more officers in the zone for officer safety reasons, but that's because [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1051.72s)]
*  of the threats that's being leveled against them. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1055.76s)]
*  I am just aware that in some ways, the fear that is generated by these actions can be [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1057.88s)]
*  helpful to achieving that aim of getting people to self-deport. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1063.68s)]
*  I mean, we know one effect of these raids is that people in these communities, they [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1067.24s)]
*  are afraid, right, based on our reporting. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1072.44s)]
*  There is fear that is generated, and that could lead to the result that you're saying [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1074.72s)]
*  you want. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1079.2s)]
*  What I'm saying is I don't think that's the intent. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1080.2s)]
*  I certainly believe what you're saying. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1082.0s)]
*  I believe there are people that are afraid of being arrested by ISIS because they're [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  here illegally. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1086.96s)]
*  I follow that. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1087.96s)]
*  I believe it, but that's certainly not the intent. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1088.96s)]
*  If it leads to more people self-deporting in a more structured, controlled manner, then [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1091.6399999999999s)]
*  I hope they do. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1098.56s)]
*  I hope they take advantage of it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1099.56s)]
*  Recently we've seen some pushback surface from a very different constituency on this, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1102.16s)]
*  which is big business. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1106.92s)]
*  Quite unexpectedly, also the president, your boss, who gave voice to some of these anxieties. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  Trump posted on social media this week that he's been hearing that the raids are having [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1115.56s)]
*  an impact on hotels and farmers. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1119.72s)]
*  I'm just going to quote from his post. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1122.16s)]
*  Our very aggressive immigration policy is taking very good, longtime workers away from [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1124.24s)]
*  them with those jobs being almost impossible to replace. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1129.48s)]
*  What did you think of that post? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1134.2s)]
*  Because from where I sit, it did look like the president saying, look, this approach [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1135.8400000000001s)]
*  that you've been taking, that ISIS has been taking, is becoming a problem. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1140.3200000000002s)]
*  Is that how you read it? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1144.52s)]
*  I think what the president is getting to is that, again, I haven't discussed this with [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1145.96s)]
*  the president. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1149.56s)]
*  I haven't had a discussion, but I saw the post. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1150.56s)]
*  I've said for a long time, and I think we started this interview with this, Congress [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  needs to make some changes. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1159.12s)]
*  If we need a workforce to do that type of work, then create a legal pathway where they [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1161.48s)]
*  don't have to pay a smuggler, then come with a visa and come here to work, do their job [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1165.48s)]
*  and go home, pay their taxes or whatever. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1169.32s)]
*  I think the president understands that there's a broken system here, but it doesn't mean [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1171.36s)]
*  we just ignore the law. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1176.12s)]
*  So we're clear because I think there was a lot of confusion after this. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1177.48s)]
*  What is the policy? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1180.1200000000001s)]
*  Are you still doing the workplace raids because there was a lot of back and forth? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1181.1200000000001s)]
*  We are still doing workplace raids, but again, based on prioritization. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1185.0800000000002s)]
*  There's a victim of trafficking, some of the financing going to other illegal ventures [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1188.76s)]
*  like cartel activity or drug smuggling. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1193.8s)]
*  So if there's a violation of laws, because it's about the health and safety of the alien [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1195.96s)]
*  who's being abused, the worst first. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1200.1200000000001s)]
*  I want to talk about what's happened to people once they have been swept up in these raids. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1202.1200000000001s)]
*  They're taken into ICE custody where we've seen reports that they have no ability to [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1206.64s)]

*  Mr. Homan, last question here. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1276.84s)]
*  You clearly think that these deportations benefit the United States, right? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1278.88s)]
*  That it makes it a safer place, that it makes it a place where American workers come first, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1282.76s)]
*  where the rule of law is respected. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1288.68s)]
*  What some of these business leaders, these farmers, these hotel owners, and some politicians, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1291.62s)]
*  including Republicans, are saying is, wait a minute, this actually might be bad for the [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1298.4199999999998s)]
*  U.S. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1305.3799999999999s)]
*  And to a degree, the protestors are saying the same thing on different grounds, but it's [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1306.3799999999999s)]
*  the same idea. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1312.02s)]
*  How do you know that you're right and that they're wrong? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1314.32s)]
*  Okay, you know, the senior leaders of this effort meet every day at 10 a.m. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1318.9s)]
*  We look at the effects of what we're doing. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1325.5400000000002s)]

*  I've worked for six different presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1329.94s)]

*  Can plans be fluctuated? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1353.0s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1354.0s)]
*  I was up on the Hill several times last week, meeting with congressmen and senators. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOgV_3IwPpA&t=1355.0s)]
