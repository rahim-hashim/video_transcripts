# The Rules of War
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C5z4UvCNZc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  In the International Court of Justice, South Africa is accusing Israel of committing genocide
*  in Gaza.
*  Today, my colleague, Amanda Taub, on the arguments in that case and the power that the rules
*  of war have, beyond any verdict in court.
*  It's Monday, January 22nd.
*  So Amanda, right now, the International Court of Justice in The Hague is considering South
*  Africa's accusation that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
*  You happen to be a former human rights lawyer, and you've been following this case in the
*  larger conversation around the rules of war and whether those rules are being broken in
*  this conflict.
*  Both sides presented their arguments a couple of weeks ago.
*  So explain what exactly this case is.
*  So this case, I think, is just the latest way in which international law has really
*  become one of the most crucial lenses for understanding this conflict.
*  Obviously, it's incredibly politically contentious.
*  This is something that has just tremendously painful emotional resonance for people around
*  the world, as well as very significant consequences for the people in Israel and Gaza.
*  And so I think there has been a real turn to the principles and norms of international
*  law as something that can provide a neutral ground, a neutral framework for understanding
*  what's going on for saying, OK, these are the standards that we've already agreed to
*  adhere to.
*  Are they being met?
*  So South Africa several weeks ago filed an application with the International Court of
*  Justice, which is a UN tribunal that hears disputes between states saying Israel is violating
*  its obligations under the Genocide Convention.
*  And that does two things.
*  One, it begins a case where the court will eventually make a determination about whether
*  this treaty has actually been violated.
*  But the second thing, which I think is actually most important here, is that South Africa
*  requested what are called provisional measures, which are kind of the international law version
*  of a restraining order or like a temporary injunction where you can get relief now.
*  You can get an order now from the court.
*  And to be clear, this case is just about Israel and what they're doing in this conflict, right?
*  And not about Hamas and what it's doing toward Israel.
*  That's right.
*  And that's because it actually can't concern Hamas.
*  The cases before the ICJ, which only hears disputes between states, and it also concerns
*  a treaty that Hamas is not a part of.
*  So there's actually just no basis legally for Hamas to be part of this case.
*  Why South Africa?
*  Why is South Africa the country bringing this case against Israel?
*  So there are two ways to answer that question.
*  The legal answer to that question is that they are also a party to the Convention on
*  Genocide.
*  And so legally, they're considered to have an interest in its enforcement anywhere in
*  the world.
*  Okay.
*  This isn't the first time something like that has happened.
*  Actually, Gambia brought a case against Myanmar alleging that they were committing genocide
*  against the Rohingya minority there.
*  So there is some precedent for a seemingly unconnected member state of this treaty to
*  bring a case like this.
*  And then the other way to answer that question is more about the politics of it, which is
*  that South Africa, because of their own history with apartheid, has long been a major political
*  supporter of the Palestinian cause.
*  I think a lot of people within South Africa see some parallels between their history and
*  the situation of Palestinians.
*  And so it's something that has a lot of political resonance for them.
*  Okay.
*  So there's this treaty that lots of countries, including South Africa and Israel, have signed
*  on to.
*  And if one country thinks another country is committing genocide, you can bring a case
*  to this international court, this International Court of Justice.
*  And that's what South Africa is doing.
*  They're saying Israel is committing genocide right now, and we essentially want a temporary
*  restraining order to stop it.
*  Exactly.
*  Okay.
*  So when South Africa says that Israel is committing genocide, what exactly does that mean?
*  So I think it's really helpful here to start with what the Genocide Convention, which
*  is the treaty at issue, actually says.
*  So it defines genocide as acts that are committed with intent to destroy a group in whole or
*  in part.
*  And that can be a racial group, an ethnic group, a religious group.
*  So South Africa really has alleged two things here.
*  They've alleged actions on Israel's part, which are both things that its military has
*  actually done and things that it has condoned, such as allowing people to make statements
*  that South Africa argues constitute incitement to genocide without stopping them or punishing
*  them.
*  And that these things were done with the intention for the purpose of destroying the civilian
*  population in Gaza in whole or in part.
*  Okay.
*  So the idea that South Africa is asserting is that this is an intentional attempt to
*  destroy people because they are part of a particular group, in this case, Gazans.
*  genocide, even if that attempt fails.
*  That's right.
*  And one thing that is often a little bit confusing to people about this is that it's not actually
*  a matter just of the level of violence that takes place.
*  And this is really what distinguishes it from a lot of other crimes under international
*  law, such as other crimes against humanity is really about that intent.
*  You could have very, very high levels of violence, but if it is done for another purpose, if
*  it doesn't have that genocidal intent, then it wouldn't constitute genocide.
*  And conversely, you could actually have a relatively small amount of violence.
*  But if it is done with that intent to destroy a group, then that would constitute genocide
*  under this definition.
*  And when they presented their case in court a couple of weeks ago, what evidence does
*  South Africa point to to support this claim?
*  Thank you, Madam President and distinguished members of the court.
*  So South Africa's team of lawyers pointed to a number of statements, including by very
*  senior officials within the Israeli military and the Israeli government.
*  Israel's political leaders, military commanders and persons holding official positions have
*  systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent.
*  One of the most important ones was a statement that the defense minister, Yoav Galant, made
*  on the 9th of October, just two days after Hamas's attack on Israel.
*  Where he said that as Israel was imposing a complete siege on Gaza, there would be no
*  electricity, no food, no water, no fuel.
*  Everything would be closed because Israel is fighting human animals.
*  And one reason why it's so important that this statement came from Galant is that he
*  is somebody who's not only very senior within the Israeli government, he's also somebody
*  who's in a command authority position within the military.
*  He's the defense minister.
*  Right.
*  Sinocidal utterances are therefore not out in the fringes.
*  They are embodied in state policy.
*  So what else does South Africa point to?
*  I mean, either in terms of Israel's intentions or, as you say, its actions.
*  For the past 96 days, Israel has subjected Gaza to what has been described as one of
*  the heaviest conventional bombing campaigns in the history of modern warfare.
*  So they also speak about the bombings that Israel has been carrying out in Gaza.
*  They are killed in their homes, in places where they seek shelter, in hospitals, in
*  schools, in mosques, in churches, and as they try to find food and water for their families.
*  The idea here is to show not just the scale of violence, but that taken together, it's
*  a pattern that suggests that civilians are being targeted just because they are people
*  within Gaza, not because they are Hamas fighters, not because they are combatants.
*  The imminent risk of death, harm and destruction that Palestinians in Gaza face today and that
*  they risk every day during the pendency of these proceedings, on any view justifies,
*  indeed compels the indication of provisional measures.
*  Some might say that the very reputation of international law, its ability and willingness
*  to bind and to protect all people equally hangs in the balance.
*  So that was South Africa's case.
*  That concludes South Africa's address.
*  Thank you.
*  Okay, so what was Israel's defense?
*  So the next day, the day after South Africa delivered its arguments,
*  Madam President, distinguished members of the court.
*  Israel's lawyers had a chance to deliver their rebuttal in effect.
*  The state of Israel is singularly aware of why the Genocide Convention, which has been
*  invoked in these proceedings, was adopted.
*  And their focus was really on reframing this to focus on Hamas, to focus on the violence
*  that Hamas perpetrated in Israel, and tying that to Israel's history as a state that
*  was in many ways born as a reaction of genocide.
*  Seared in our collective memory is the systematic murder of six million Jews as part of a premeditated
*  and heinous program for their total annihilation.
*  And they moved from there to talk about the attacks on October 7th.
*  The events of that day are all but ignored in the applicant's submissions.
*  But we are compelled to share with the court some fraction of its horror, the largest calculated
*  mass murder of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust.
*  And they said Hamas is engaged in a genocidal project of trying to erase the state of Israel,
*  and that the violence that they committed on October 7th was an example of the type
*  of genocidal violence they are using as part of that project.
*  If there have been acts that may be characterized as genocidal, then they have been perpetrated
*  against Israel.
*  And then from there, they addressed the statements like the one that Gollant had made and some
*  others that South Africa had pointed to.
*  Some of the comments to its South Afro-grapher are clearly rhetorical, made in the immediate
*  aftermath of an event which severely traumatized Israel, but which cannot be seen as demanding
*  genocide.
*  They express anguish.
*  Saying, in effect, these were emotional statements made in the heat of the moment for a domestic
*  political audience, and they didn't reflect actual policy.
*  So their position is that this factually is not happening, and also this wasn't really
*  showing intent.
*  This was just words and emotional speech.
*  Israel has publicly stated repeatedly that there is no limit on the amount of food, water,
*  shelter or medical supplies that can be brought into Gaza.
*  And just to be clear, Times reporting and statements by the UN have said that, in fact,
*  there are major restrictions on the humanitarian aid that's being allowed into Gaza.
*  According to the presentation by the applicant, it was as if Israel is operating in Gaza against
*  no armed adversary.
*  And the other thing that they argue is that to the extent there is a threat to the civilians
*  of Gaza, that threat comes from Hamas.
*  But the same Hamas that carried out the October 7 attacks in Israel is the governing authority
*  in Gaza.
*  And the same Hamas has built a military strategy founded on embedding its assets and operatives
*  in and amongst the civilian population.
*  And so their argument here is that actually it is Hamas that's endangering civilians by
*  using them and the places where civilians are located in order to conduct its military
*  activities.
*  And then their last argument was that, in fact, Israel cares deeply about international
*  law and is going to great lengths to ensure that it's followed.
*  As the authority responsible for international law advice to Israel's government and cabinet,
*  I can attest that in contending with these challenges, Israel remains committed to international
*  law.
*  So, the lawyer who argued this particular point is somebody called Gilad Noam.
*  He is one of their deputy attorney generals.
*  And he basically came to the court to say, not only is this something we take very seriously,
*  and I'm ensuring that these standards are met.
*  When the cannons roar in Gaza, the law is not silent.
*  And so with that, Israel's day of presenting their arguments came to an end.
*  Okay, so this makes me want to understand better these international rules he's talking
*  about.
*  Yeah.
*  So even though this case just concerns genocide and just concerns the treaty, the convention
*  against genocide, it's actually just one very small part of this broader legal universe,
*  which has become so crucially important in the way that this conflict is not just being
*  fought but actually viewed and understood by the rest of the world.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, what is this broader legal universe, you know, the international rules around war,
*  and where do they come from?
*  So, this is a group of laws that were largely developed after World War II in response to
*  the world kind of looking at the horrors that took place during that conflict and realizing
*  that technological capabilities had reached the point that there was really no limit to
*  the amount of destruction that war could wreak and that we needed some sort of limits that
*  could be collectively agreed on in order to protect everyone.
*  And they are mostly concerned with protecting people who are non-combatants.
*  So that means civilians, it also means prisoners of war.
*  And the idea is that if you are not actively a participant, then you are entitled to certain
*  protections.
*  And if you think about this, you know, this was happening in the years immediately after
*  World War II.
*  So, not only were things like the full horrors of the Holocaust becoming known, but Europe
*  was still literally rebuilding from these horrific bombing campaigns that had happened.
*  This was also, you know, after Hiroshima, after Nagasaki, we were really kind of waking
*  up to the fact that law and other kind of principles around this were going to be the
*  only thing that restrained this level of violence.
*  So one of the set of laws that came out of this was the Geneva Conventions.
*  Those are the most important kind of legal treaties that govern how wars can be fought
*  and actually became so important within the international legal system that they're now
*  considered universally binding on all countries in almost every case.
*  And importantly, these also apply to individuals and to armed groups that aren't states, which
*  means that almost all of these rules apply to Hamas.
*  Hamas is able to commit violations of the laws of war and its members are able to be
*  criminally liable for attacks that they committed on October 7th and other things that they
*  have done before and since.
*  So the world decided that there were absolute red lines that every country or person in
*  any conflict anywhere has to abide by because a world without these rules was too horrific
*  to contemplate.
*  And if you don't abide, there's a whole system of international courts to hold you responsible.
*  That's right.
*  Okay, so give me some examples of the actual rules under international law.
*  So I think the easiest way to understand this is to start from this basic principle that
*  civilians have to be protected.
*  So that means you can't target civilians directly in warfare.
*  That's illegal.
*  But then there's also this really important principle that says even if you're going for
*  a military target, so an opposing commander or soldiers or something like that, the harm
*  that that causes to civilians has to be proportional to the military gain that you're going to
*  achieve.
*  So this is called the rule of proportionality.
*  It's something that I think is really widely misunderstood.
*  So they might say more than 20,000 people, most of whom are civilians, have been killed
*  in Gaza and around 1200 Israelis, again, most of whom are civilians have been killed.
*  And they just compare those numbers and they say, how could this be proportional?
*  But actually, that's not how it works.
*  It's not a comparison of the numbers on each side of the conflict.
*  It's a comparison of the civilian harm of a particular attack and the military advantage
*  to be gained.
*  So then if this rule of proportionality is about each individual attack and not sheer
*  numbers, how do actors in a conflict figure out what is just under this rule?
*  So it ends up basically looking like an equation.
*  So they have to take an evidence based estimate of what they think the civilian harms of a
*  particular attack might be.
*  And they have to calculate also the military value of the target that they're trying to
*  achieve.
*  And then they weigh them against each other.
*  And it seems strange to kind of assign numerical values to some of those things.
*  But in effect, what the law requires is for the harm to be less than the value.
*  So the rule is not you can't harm civilians ever.
*  The rule is if your military target is important enough, you can accept a higher level of civilian
*  harm.
*  There has to be a really good reason, in other words.
*  Right.
*  But this seems kind of squishy, right?
*  How do you define good enough reason?
*  What is that math?
*  How do people think about that?
*  So this is something that militaries tend to keep secret most of the time because it's
*  part of their operational policy.
*  So that kind of information tends to be classified.
*  But we know from some information that has been released about previous wars what this
*  kind of thing can look like.
*  So for instance, the US has said that during the war in Afghanistan, the usual acceptable
*  level of casualties that were considered proportional in most attacks was zero.
*  That they just had that as their baseline.
*  And that at the very top, if you were going after Osama bin Laden, the highest level of
*  casualties that could be acceptable for somebody like that was 30.
*  So that gives you a sense of kind of the scale that the US was considering in that war.
*  And also importantly, even if these are the legal guidelines that are being given within
*  They're not always followed.
*  And attacks don't always go the way you expect.
*  Okay, so Amanda, it feels worth at this point pointing out that Hamas has said that no civilians
*  were killed in Israel on October 7th.
*  And it's questioned what even is a civilian.
*  It suggested over and over that all Israelis are engaging in an illegal occupation.
*  And therefore everyone really is a legitimate military target.
*  Now obviously, civilians were killed on October 7th.
*  So the idea that they weren't is not true.
*  So how do we think about that?
*  I mean, if one side doesn't really consider civilians, civilians, they're not doing this
*  math that you're talking about.
*  And I assume under the rules of war, that the definition of a civilian is not subjective
*  and certainly not defined by one's enemy.
*  That's right.
*  So a civilian is a civilian.
*  And you certainly don't get out of your legal obligations to protect and ensure that all
*  attacks are proportional just by saying they're not civilians.
*  That is not how that works.
*  But also, this is not something where a violation by one side affects the protections that other
*  civilians enjoy.
*  So for instance, if Hamas makes these statements publicly disavowing its intention to comply
*  with these protections for civilians, that doesn't change the protections that Israeli
*  civilians have under the law.
*  But it also doesn't change the protections that Gazan civilians have under the law.
*  Those protections are rules that apply to all people just because they're people.
*  And it's not something that can be canceled out by wrongdoing on the part of one party
*  or another to the conflict.
*  Got it.
*  So you're saying basically that even if there was an inciting event that was a violation,
*  it doesn't mean that the other side has just caused to do its own violation.
*  Exactly.
*  There's no tit for tat here.
*  It's not eye for an eye under this system.
*  The civilians have the protection because they're civilians.
*  OK.
*  So what if a legitimate military target is intentionally embedded within a civilian area,
*  which Hamas is accused of doing, specifically to make that calculation actually harder for
*  Israel?
*  So I think this is a great example of a case in which violations from one side don't change
*  the rules for the other.
*  So if Hamas is intentionally embedding itself in civilian areas in order to protect its
*  military operations and thereby endangering civilians, that is a violation of international
*  law on Hamas's part.
*  But even if it is the case that Hamas is committing such a violation and that is why the civilians
*  are in harm's way, that doesn't change the other party's obligation to comply with the
*  rules of proportionality.
*  So they still have to treat those civilians as civilians.
*  They still have to take them into account when they're determining whether an attack
*  is legitimate.
*  So even if it's a violation, it still does make the calculation harder for Israel.
*  Like it kind of works if you're Hamas, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it is true that some of these rules can make fighting a war and winning a war
*  more difficult.
*  But the point of this international system is to say it's worth giving up some military
*  advantage sometimes in order to have this protective system, which we all benefit from.
*  So here's something we thought about on the show that kind of pushes this idea to the
*  limit.
*  And that is if Hamas is putting their central command centers underneath hospitals, like
*  the Israelis are asserting, Israel would still have to take into account the civilian casualties
*  during any kind of attack on those hospitals, even if their goal is to destroy that command
*  center.
*  That's right.
*  So hospitals actually have special heightened protection under international humanitarian
*  law because they're seen as essential to civilian life.
*  So it's not just the immediate consequences that are so serious when targeting a hospital,
*  but that the loss of a hospital, if a hospital is attacked, also has significant consequences
*  for the civilian population.
*  So the baseline assumption is that hospitals are entitled to protection from attack.
*  If a hospital is being used for a military purpose, which to be clear would be a very
*  serious violation of international law by whoever was using the hospital that way, then
*  the hospital would lose that protection.
*  But the same rules of proportionality still apply.
*  So the civilians who are within that hospital still have to be taken into account.
*  And any military action to take out the command center or arrest people or similar needs to
*  be targeted.
*  And the goal needs to be to allow the hospital to return to its function afterwards.
*  This speaks to what you've been saying about the fundamental function of these rules of
*  war, which is to protect civilians' ability to live in the context of war.
*  Like they're still entitled to food, water, and medical care.
*  That's right.
*  And there are many different provisions within the Geneva Conventions and other parts of
*  international law that are really designed to protect that principle.
*  So for instance, collective punishments are illegal.
*  You can't punish civilians collectively for the actions of a government or an action of
*  somebody else.
*  It's also illegal to use starvation of civilians as a weapon of war.
*  You can't use that for strategic advantage, even if you could get one.
*  And likewise, you can't kill civilians, you cannot take them hostage, etc.
*  Right.
*  You said this term collective punishment.
*  You hear that a lot, Bandied, about it.
*  You heard the UN Secretary General say that just the other day.
*  Yeah.
*  I think he's really referring to this situation in Gaza where the civilians there collectively
*  are facing grave harm.
*  So the United Nations has warned that the whole Gaza Strip is at risk of a severe famine.
*  They've been warning for months now of other humanitarian concerns and of course the effects
*  of the actual conflict itself.
*  I want to ask about another aspect of destroying civilian infrastructure, which is the destruction
*  of people's homes.
*  Now we know that a huge percentage, the UN says 85% at this point, which is like 2 million
*  Gazans, most of the population, have been displaced from their homes.
*  What do the rules say about displacement?
*  So this is a little bit of a complicated area of law because there are two principles here
*  that can really be in tension with each other.
*  So the first is that before an attack, the attacking military or party has to warn civilians
*  and give them a chance to leave.
*  And early in this conflict when Israel told Gazan civilians to leave the north, Israel
*  framed that as a warning.
*  But many people saw it as in conflict with this other principle, which is that it's illegal
*  to forcibly displace or deport civilians.
*  If the intent is to protect civilians, then that's basically okay.
*  But if the intent is to displace them in order to take their land, in order to force them
*  out of a territory, gain political power, etc., then that's not okay.
*  So Israel has said that people will be allowed to return to their homes.
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu has spoken to this specifically.
*  But there is still going to be a practical consideration of whether that's possible.
*  Right.
*  If you're allowed to return, in this case to the north, but there's really nothing left
*  to return to because so many of the homes are destroyed, does that really count as being
*  allowed to return?
*  Yeah, I think that's where the legal questions start to get muddy about what the obligations
*  are to enable return and what that's going to look like.
*  And I think that that is something that is hugely unclear at this stage of the conflict,
*  what there will be to return to.
*  The Palestinians have already had displacement as such an important part of their history
*  that questions of displacement happening now, I think, have particularly heavy emotional
*  resonance for them.
*  Okay, so say one side or another of any conflict appears to violate these rules that you've
*  laid out.
*  What could happen?
*  We know that one option is that a country can accuse one of the sides of genocide because
*  that's what's happening before the International Court of Justice right now.
*  But what else could happen?
*  Yeah, so I think that's a good example of how there can be consequences for states such
*  as an action like that one, which was brought over a treaty violation.
*  The same thing has happened in the case of Russia, for instance, to do with their invasion
*  of Ukraine.
*  But there can also be consequences for individuals.
*  So going back again to this example of Russia, there's also a criminal case pending against
*  Putin in a different international court that is also related to the way the war in Ukraine
*  has been fought.
*  And so this is something that comes up often when there is a conflict with severe violence
*  and allegations of atrocities that can lead both to consequences for the states involved,
*  but also to individual consequences, including criminal charges.
*  So that can include charges for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
*  So war crimes need to happen in the context of a war, but crimes against humanity can
*  happen in other contexts as well.
*  Okay, so countries and individuals can face these really serious charges if they violate
*  these rules around conflict.
*  But what actually happens if you're charged and found guilty?
*  Because it seems difficult to enforce and actually to hold people and countries accountable.
*  It seems hard.
*  It is hard.
*  So for instance, the ICJ case over genocide, even if they do issue provisional measures
*  in that case sometime in the next few months, that court doesn't have any police officers.
*  It doesn't have peacekeepers.
*  It doesn't have any way to kind of militarily enforce any kind of judgment.
*  But it does still carry a huge amount of weight in terms of the way that its judgment is perceived
*  and the way that it could affect Israel's standing in the world and particularly with
*  its allies in Europe and North America.
*  So we've already seen it have some effect, I think, although it's hard to know for certain.
*  It seems very notable that in the weeks since South Africa originally filed their case,
*  Israel has started to make new agreements on allowing in humanitarian aid.
*  Their attorney general has announced that she is going to investigate statements by
*  certain lawmakers to determine if they could be considered incitement.
*  They have announced that their military operation will soon be scaling down, kind of entering
*  a new phase.
*  And I think that those actions both reflect a desire to maybe affect the court's judgment.
*  It also reflects, I think, a desire to show that it is a law abiding country.
*  So you're basically saying even if these courts can't put people in jail, there are other
*  forms of accountability that having these universally agreed upon rules give.
*  That these rules provide a way to figure out who is essentially allowed to be in good standing
*  in the world.
*  Yeah, I think that that's one reason why these rules and this broader system of justice
*  really matter.
*  You know, they matter to Israelis, they matter to Palestinians, they matter to the rest of
*  the world.
*  But I think they're also doing something here that's really important that goes beyond this
*  particular conflict, but is also really, really relevant to it, which is it gives us a way
*  to understand right and wrong and fair and unfair, even when we're completely overwhelmed
*  by the emotion of reading about a particularly horrific attack, of hearing about something
*  that is a level of unimaginable violence happening to families or children or people who might
*  remind us of ourselves.
*  And that can be one of the hardest circumstances in which to make a kind of reasoned judgment
*  and figure out the best way forward.
*  And so having this set of rules, which has already been agreed on, has already been worked
*  out. It applies not just to both sides in this conflict, but to the entire world, really
*  offers a way forward in how to think about this, how to understand this and how to envision
*  maybe even possible solutions that the parties to this might eventually reach.
*  Amanda, thank you.
*  Sabrina, thank you so much.
*  In a televised news conference earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  said he would not relent in the war in Gaza until Israel had achieved what he described
*  as total victory.
*  He added that nobody would stop Israel, quote, not the Hague and not anybody else.
*  The court in the Hague could issue a preliminary ruling as soon as next month.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops,
*  more interviews, I would do it.
*  But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we
*  don't have a clear path to victory.
*  Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.
*  On Sunday, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida suspended his campaign for president and endorsed
*  the frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, with the primary race in New Hampshire
*  in its final 48 hours.
*  I've had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his
*  elevation of Anthony Fauci.
*  Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden.
*  That is clear.
*  I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge.
*  The move cements the Republican contest as a two-person race between Trump and former
*  Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina, a little less than a week after DeSantis' devastating
*  30 percentage point loss to Trump in Iowa.
*  It remains to be seen whether DeSantis' departure will help Haley, who is believed to be better
*  positioned than DeSantis was, in New Hampshire and South Carolina, or whether more of his
*  supporters will migrate to Trump.
*  And...
*  And...
*  Over the weekend, President Biden pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  to agree to the creation of a Palestinian state after the war in Gaza is over.
*  It was their first phone call in more than a month amid tensions between Israel and the
*  United States over the war.
*  Biden told reporters after the call that he had presented options that would limit Palestinian
*  sovereignty to make the prospect more palatable to Israel.
*  There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that still don't have their own
*  military.
*  A number of states have no reputation.
*  And so I think there's ways in which this could work.
*  But on Saturday night, Netanyahu doubled down on his opposition to an independent state
*  for the Palestinians, saying he would not compromise on Israeli security, adding that,
*  quote, that is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state.
