# Federal Troops Enter L.A. — and the Trump-Musk Feud Hardens
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The David. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=0.0s)]
*  During an extraordinary weekend, President Trump deployed 2,000 troops from the National [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=12.9s)]
*  Guard to suppress a protest in Los Angeles against his own immigration policies and his [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=18.36s)]
*  bitter breakup with the world's richest man, Elon Musk, entered a new stage of acrimony. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=25.76s)]
*  Today, my colleagues, Los Angeles bureau chief Sean Hubler and White House correspondent [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=32.44s)]
*  Jonathan Swan, walk us through an eventful 48 hours. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=40.92s)]
*  It's Monday, June 9th. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=55.76s)]
*  Sean, you appear to be in your car. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=68.44s)]
*  Why are you in your car? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=69.4s)]
*  Because Los Angeles is a very big place and to cover Los Angeles is to be in your car most of the time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=72.28s)]
*  Fair enough. Well, thank you for doing this from your car because I'm sure it's not a dream scenario. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=80.64s)]
*  I just want to explain something. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  We had originally planned to make an episode from Monday about the acrimonious feud between [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  President Trump and Elon Musk when an even bigger story emerged from the city you cover [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=94.91999999999999s)]
*  for the Times as bureau chief. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  So we want you to tell us that story, the story you're covering from your car, about [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=103.0s)]
*  how we reached this point where the president has deployed the National Guard to put down [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=109.84s)]
*  protests in the city, which are still very much ongoing as we talk to you at almost 8 [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=116.92s)]
*  o'clock p.m. Eastern time. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=123.64s)]
*  So this has been an issue that's been kind of building for quite a while in California. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=125.6s)]
*  There have been periodic immigration enforcement actions around the state. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=130.6s)]
*  There have been immigration agents that have showed up at public schools doing welfare checks. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=135.76s)]
*  There's been a lot of wariness and nervousness around immigration enforcement all over the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=141.04s)]
*  state in California. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=147.2s)]
*  But in Los Angeles, it really came to a head at the end of last week on a Friday in a part [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=149.16s)]
*  of Los Angeles that is very dense and very busy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=155.94s)]
*  So on Friday afternoon, outside of a clothing wholesaler, immigration and custom enforcement [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=162.48s)]
*  agents showed up and they showed up to start arresting people who had been deported once [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  already, but who they believed had come back. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  Got it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=180.12s)]
*  So they were there to detain them and probably to deport them again. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=181.12s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  So federal agents come into this clothing wholesaler at about one thirty in the afternoon [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  and they show up and they start detaining people, you know, employees inside this business [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=191.48s)]
*  and loading them into vans as other agents in riot gear start to kind of close in on [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  the area. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=202.88s)]
*  And people inevitably in this cramped closed space start to freak out and make phone calls [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=204.12s)]
*  and word gets out and people start to show up and gather around. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=211.04s)]
*  And in this kind of military display of power, these federal agents start to disperse the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=217.0s)]
*  crowd and they're dressed in military gear and they're driving, you know, sort of military [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=222.44s)]
*  tactical vehicles and trucks and just sort of the show of force is so unnerving to people [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=229.16s)]
*  that protests erupt. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=237.96s)]
*  And this is clearly now a confrontation from what you're describing between protesters [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=240.0s)]
*  and federal agents. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=244.4s)]
*  It's explicit. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=246.72s)]
*  It is an explicit confrontation between federal agents and activists and also just general [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=247.72s)]
*  members of the working public in downtown Los Angeles. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=256.2s)]
*  There were a hundred people who were arrested according to the U.S. Attorney's Office and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=265.72s)]
*  things did eventually calm down. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=270.36s)]
*  But the sense was that this was sort of a one and done, you know, outburst that had [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=272.8s)]
*  happened kind of organically and that it hadn't gone too badly. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=278.08s)]
*  That was on Friday night. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=282.6s)]
*  So by Saturday the sense is that the worst of this is potentially over. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=284.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=290.12s)]
*  Then Saturday morning, about 20 miles away from downtown Los Angeles in a working class [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=291.12s)]
*  suburb called Paramount, word has gotten out that there's going to probably be another [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=298.52s)]
*  immigration action enforcement at this Home Depot where there are a lot of immigrant laborers. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  And word begins to spread that there might be this enforcement action, that there might [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  be a sweep, that they might be rounding up day laborers. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=314.28s)]
*  And so protesters begin to show up. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=317.56s)]
*  Crowds begin to gather. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  So suddenly it doesn't necessarily look like the worst of this is over. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  Suddenly it's apparent that the worst of this may not be over at all. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=326.6s)]
*  This incident too involves authorities in military gear and begins to escalate, you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=331.72s)]
*  know, over the course of the day. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=337.16s)]
*  We see you for what you are, a terrorist organization. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=339.12s)]
*  I, Otto Paramount, you are not welcome here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=343.32s)]
*  People protest, they yell things, they throw rocks at cars, they sort of clash with federal agents. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=347.0s)]
*  Hey, what happened to you, bro? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=353.59999999999997s)]
*  They shot you in the head? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=356.59999999999997s)]
*  You all right? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=359.59999999999997s)]
*  And so as Saturday morning gives way to Saturday afternoon, gives way to Saturday night, the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=361.0s)]
*  authorities order the crowd to disperse and start again to disperse them with pepper spray [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=366.12s)]
*  and flashbang grenades and so on. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=374.68s)]
*  And as all of this is unfolding kind of throughout the day in Los Angeles, word gets out that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  President Trump has been on the phone with Governor Newsom and has told him that he's [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=390.52000000000004s)]
*  planning to send in the National Guard. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=396.18s)]
*  And what does California's governor say in response in this call? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=400.76s)]
*  He says, Mr. President, that's not a good idea. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=405.20000000000005s)]
*  Governor Newsom tells President Trump that this is only going to inflame the situation, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=409.64s)]
*  that sending in the National Guard more military force is only going to terrify Californians [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=414.24s)]
*  and or incite people who are on the fringes to do even more violent and crazy things. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=420.88s)]
*  That no good can come of it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=428.76s)]
*  And in any case, it's not necessary because Governor Newsom tells the president, look, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=430.24s)]
*  we're handling this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=435.52s)]
*  We can handle this. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=436.52s)]
*  We have local authorities who can disperse the protesters. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=437.72s)]
*  It isn't out of control, the governor tells the president. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=442.6s)]
*  It is actually in control. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=445.44000000000005s)]
*  As a matter of fact, at one point in the city of Los Angeles on Saturday, the Los Angeles [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=447.32000000000005s)]
*  Police Department put out a press release commending the protesters within L.A. city [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=452.24s)]
*  limits for conducting civil disobedience in such a peaceful way. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=457.6s)]
*  And whatever you may be seeing on social media, it's easily quelled. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=462.52s)]
*  Nevertheless, President Trump ignores the governor and by dusk or so in Los Angeles, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=468.12s)]
*  he has issued this order, federalizing the National Guard and sending 2,000 troops into [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=476.47999999999996s)]
*  Los Angeles. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=484.08s)]
*  And Sean, just explain for those of us who don't think a lot about what it means for [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=486.2s)]
*  the president to federalize the National Guard, which has always been this complicated, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=492.0s)]
*  hybrid state federal entity, what it means for the president to do this and do it the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=496.64s)]
*  way he did over the objections of a governor. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=504.64s)]
*  It is highly unusual for the president to commandeer the National Guard. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=509.04s)]
*  The National Guards are usually controlled by governors. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=514.48s)]
*  When they're deployed for something, it's usually something big and it's usually with [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=518.4s)]
*  the governor's consent and often with the governor's request. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=523.8s)]
*  In many ways, this was something that was sort of the worst nightmare of California, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=528.52s)]
*  something that California authorities had seen coming and had been concerned about and [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=533.04s)]
*  in fact actually had even gamed out a little bit in the run up to the election. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=538.16s)]
*  Just explain that. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=543.04s)]
*  In Trump's first term, he talked then about wanting to use the National Guard to put down [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=544.52s)]
*  protests, to put down the George Floyd protests, for example. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=550.36s)]
*  And there was also talk in the run up to the election about using the National Guard to [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=553.8s)]
*  do things like help with immigration enforcement. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=558.76s)]
*  And so there was concern long before the election in California that we may have gotten through [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=561.68s)]
*  the president's first term without something like this happening in California, but we [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=566.8s)]
*  might not get through two terms and that this was almost certainly going to happen. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=571.08s)]
*  And what was California going to do when it did? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=575.04s)]
*  And the reason for this is that authorities here knew that the law wasn't going to give [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=578.68s)]
*  them a lot of options. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=583.88s)]
*  What the president is doing is perfectly legal. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=585.32s)]
*  And he was acting under a provision of something called Title 10 of the U.S. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=587.96s)]
*  Government Code that allows him to summon the National Guard to see to it that federal [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=593.56s)]
*  authorities are able to conduct the people's business without interference. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=599.12s)]
*  And so that was the provision under which he decided to call up the Guard. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=603.36s)]
*  But what Governor Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass and and many other folks in Southern California [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=608.64s)]
*  are saying is that, yeah, legal or not, this is not what the National Guard is supposed [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=614.96s)]
*  to be used for, that this is, as the governor put it, purposefully inflammatory and that, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=619.8s)]
*  In fact, it was the federal government that was the problem here, that it was their presence, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=625.36s)]
*  their military attitude, their confrontational attitude that was really causing the problem [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=630.4399999999999s)]
*  and creating a risk for everybody involved. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=636.64s)]
*  Sean, I'm curious. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=640.36s)]
*  I mean, those are Democratic officials who may have many layers of objections to what [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=641.6s)]
*  the president has done here. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  Some may be principled, some may involve some politics. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  Based on your reporting, based on what our colleagues have seen, does sending the National [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=652.8s)]
*  Guard out to contain the protests you have described, which sound like they have been [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  meaningful and at times have gotten violent, but whose scale is a little hard to measure, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=664.76s)]
*  does it seem proportional to the situation on the ground there? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=671.24s)]
*  No, it does not seem proportional to the situation on the ground. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=675.52s)]
*  From the standpoint of anyone who's lived in Los Angeles for any length of time, these [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=679.66s)]
*  protests are, they're nowhere close to the level of protest, the level of disruption [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=683.82s)]
*  that the National Guard has been called in to address in the past. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=691.38s)]
*  Look, I was in Los Angeles in 1992. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=695.98s)]
*  1992 was the last time the National Guard was sent to Los Angeles to put down a riot. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=699.02s)]
*  Right, at the request of the governor. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=704.22s)]
*  At the request of the governor. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=707.22s)]
*  And that was done with the approval of most of the public. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=708.9s)]
*  I was here when the riots broke out. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=712.7s)]
*  They were all over the city. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=715.02s)]
*  They involved bricks and rocks and bottles being thrown at traffic, people being killed, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=717.34s)]
*  people being pulled out of their cars and trucks and beaten up to near death. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=724.62s)]
*  A real breakdown in social order. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=729.86s)]
*  This was not that. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=734.02s)]
*  This was not even an echo of that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=735.46s)]
*  Well, Sean, to the degree that the National Guard is now there at this hour, what are [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=737.9000000000001s)]
*  they doing exactly? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=743.5s)]
*  How is this working? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=745.1800000000001s)]
*  And as best you can tell, is it, as Governor Newsom and the Democratic leaders in the state [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=746.26s)]
*  fear, inflaming the situation? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=751.86s)]
*  Or is this show of federal military might bringing these, at times, violent protests [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=754.58s)]
*  to an end? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=762.34s)]
*  So right now, the National Guard troops seem to be sort of gathered around guarding federal [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=764.18s)]
*  buildings. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=769.02s)]
*  They seem to be refraining from confrontations with protesters. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=772.8199999999999s)]
*  But it certainly is not quelling the protests. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=777.78s)]
*  So far, the protests have been scattered and sporadic. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=784.0999999999999s)]
*  And there have been some clashes, but this is not going away. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=791.0200000000001s)]
*  And this appears to be a real showdown. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=795.3000000000001s)]
*  And Governor Newsom formally asked to pull the National Guard out of Los Angeles. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=799.1s)]
*  He called the president's deployment order unlawful. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=804.98s)]
*  He said, we didn't have a problem until Trump got involved. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=808.1800000000001s)]
*  This is a serious breach of state sovereignty and inflaming tensions while pulling resources [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=811.62s)]
*  from where they're actually needed, the governor said. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=817.3000000000001s)]
*  And there are a lot of folks who really see this as a situation in which the longer the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=821.94s)]
*  National Guard troops or any sort of military forces deployed in connection with these immigration [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=828.9000000000001s)]
*  enforcement, that the more likely it is that people who are civilians will be arrested, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=834.74s)]
*  that there will be serious confrontations with protesters, and that this will be framed [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=840.9000000000001s)]
*  increasingly in political terms and that this is going to only escalate as time goes on. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=847.06s)]
*  And as one of the political experts here in Los Angeles, who I interviewed today, said to me, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=855.02s)]
*  it looks like the president wants a fight and it looks like Los Angeles could very well give him one. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=861.34s)]
*  Well, Sean, thank you very much. We appreciate it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=872.26s)]
*  Thank you, Michael. My pleasure. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=874.34s)]
*  On Sunday evening, the situation in downtown Los Angeles appeared to deteriorate. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=877.02s)]
*  A group of protesters attacked five driverless taxis, slashing their tires, smashing their [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=893.1s)]
*  windows, spray painting them with anti-ice messages, and setting at least three of them [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=899.38s)]
*  on fire. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=905.62s)]
*  After the break, Jonathan Swan on what's actually behind Trump's very public breakup with Elon Musk. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=911.14s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=925.86s)]
*  The bromance is definitely over. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=932.5s)]
*  Elon Musk and Donald Trump alliance has gone up in flames, total and utter flames. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=935.62s)]
*  Elon Musk is blasting a massive spending bill backed by President Trump. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=942.9s)]
*  Musk called the bill a, quote, disgusting abomination. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=947.14s)]
*  Trump clapping back. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=950.82s)]
*  He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=952.14s)]
*  And it didn't take long for Musk to respond, to say, without me, Trump would have lost the election. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=955.7s)]
*  Trump threatens to terminate Musk's government contracts, writing, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=962.2199999999999s)]
*  The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=965.2199999999999s)]
*  Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=969.6999999999999s)]
*  The president said Musk had Trump derangement syndrome. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=972.5s)]
*  Then Elon posted on X, time to drop the really big bomb, and wrote that Trump is, quote, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=976.7399999999999s)]
*  in the Epstein files. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=982.06s)]
*  The accusation from Musk is about as nasty as it gets, accusing somebody of being a pedophile. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=983.78s)]
*  The president also says he has no desire to repair his relationship with Musk, accusing [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=990.98s)]
*  the billionaire of being, quote, disrespectful to the office of the president. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  We're now seeing this completely fraying relationship on a full display. It's very remarkable. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1000.38s)]
*  A public meltdown unlike anything the country has ever seen. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1005.86s)]
*  Dovin, you're traveling with President Trump on what's turning out to be a very consequential [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1009.54s)]
*  weekend. We just spoke with our colleague, Sean Hubler, in Los Angeles about the implications [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1021.78s)]
*  of Trump's really historic decision to dispatch the National Guard in that city without the [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1028.5s)]
*  the state's governor or leaders. We turn to you because you have been reporting on something [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1035.46s)]
*  else happening over the past couple of days, and that's this nowadays long and high stakes [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1042.66s)]
*  feud between Trump and Elon Musk, which continues right up until now. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1049.02s)]
*  And you've spent a fair amount of time trying to understand what's really been at the heart [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1055.66s)]
*  of it. So what have you found? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1062.02s)]
*  Yeah, it seemed worth trying to understand how in the space of less than a week, Donald [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1065.1s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk went from being best friends in the Oval Office to Elon Musk saying, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1071.66s)]
*  actually, I think DJT may be a pedophile, you know, maybe on the Epstein list. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1078.02s)]
*  So maybe there's some things that happen behind the scenes that we need to figure out. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1084.34s)]
*  And so what I set out to do with my colleagues, Maggie Haberman, Teddy Schlieffer, Tyler Pager, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1088.9s)]
*  Ryan Mack, was to figure out what led to this. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1094.98s)]
*  And what we found is that you remember this press conference that Donald Trump held in [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1098.66s)]
*  the Oval Office on Elon Musk's last day in the White House. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1105.74s)]
*  Today, it's about a man named Elon, and he's one of the greatest business leaders and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1110.38s)]
*  innovators the world has ever produced. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1116.78s)]
*  He stepped forward. So this was two Fridays ago where there was this public display of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1119.1s)]
*  friendships. I expect to remain a friend and an advisor. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1125.3s)]
*  Certainly, if there's anything the president wants me to do, I'm at the president's [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1129.98s)]
*  service. There was an indication that they would continue to be great partners even as [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1133.5s)]
*  he left the government. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1137.82s)]
*  As a presentation from our country. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1139.58s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1142.54s)]
*  Take care. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1143.74s)]
*  All fake. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1147.78s)]
*  At that point, the relationship was extremely strained, particularly from Elon Musk's side. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1151.86s)]
*  He, over a period of months, was feeling more and more like the work he had been doing [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1158.02s)]
*  inside the Trump administration was for nothing. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1165.86s)]
*  So from his perspective, he comes in, he starts doze the Department of Government [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1169.3799999999999s)]
*  Efficiency with this stated mission to cut a trillion dollars out of the federal budget. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1176.22s)]
*  He slashes and burns parts of the government in a pretty haphazard way, gets a lot of tough [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1182.66s)]
*  critical media coverage as a result of that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1190.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. And at the end of all of this, from his perspective, whatever the number is, it's [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1192.78s)]
*  some number of billions. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1198.54s)]
*  It gets wiped out by the big, beautiful bill. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1200.34s)]
*  The main piece of legislation that Donald Trump is pushing through Congress for tax [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1203.8600000000001s)]
*  cuts. Just to explain what you mean, you know, the tax cuts in that bill are so big that [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1208.5s)]
*  independent nonpartisan analysts literally explain that it's going to add two point four [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1214.26s)]
*  trillion dollars in debt to the country. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1220.02s)]
*  Right. And then actually on this very last day in the White House, he gets another punch [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1222.74s)]
*  in the face. What happened immediately before that meeting was the president was in his [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1232.34s)]
*  dining room, which joins the Oval Office, and he gets presented by an aide with a packet [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1237.78s)]
*  of opposition research or negative information about a man named Jared Isaacman, who is a [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1244.78s)]
*  close friend of Elon Musk's, who Donald Trump had appointed to run NASA. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1251.6999999999998s)]
*  This was one of the big things that Elon Musk had asked of Donald Trump during transition. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1257.5800000000002s)]
*  He really wanted this. Obviously, NASA is hugely important to Elon Musk's rocket business, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1262.42s)]
*  SpaceX. It's also his whole mission of getting to Mars. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1267.74s)]
*  There is no federal agency more important to Elon Musk than NASA. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1271.74s)]
*  Yeah. So Trump names Jared Isaacman as his NASA administrator, and he was set to actually [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1274.7s)]
*  be confirmed with a vote from the full Senate the very next week. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1280.78s)]
*  But right before the press conference where they're giving Musk this very warm farewell, Trump [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1287.8200000000002s)]
*  is handed this packet with all of these donations that Isaacman has made to Democrats. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1293.98s)]
*  And right after the press conference, the cameras stop, the press gets kicked out. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1303.02s)]
*  And then there's this extraordinary meeting in the Oval Office with quite a large group, and [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1308.3s)]
*  Elon Musk and Trump starts reading aloud to Musk and the room these donations that Isaacman [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1314.78s)]
*  had made to Democratic politicians and saying, you know, this is not good. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1323.86s)]
*  We can't have this. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1327.74s)]
*  And what proceeds is this extraordinary scene where Trump is essentially humiliating Musk [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1329.42s)]
*  in front of a large group of White House staff. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1336.34s)]
*  But can I just make sure I understand this scene you're describing? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1339.6200000000001s)]
*  Right after Trump has just warmly said goodbye to Elon Musk in the Oval Office and the doors [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1342.5s)]
*  are closed, the cameras leave, the president is starting to read to everyone in the room, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1348.58s)]
*  including Musk, from an opposition research file in which he's finding more and more things [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1353.8600000000001s)]
*  about Musk's choice to run NASA that he doesn't like. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1360.02s)]
*  And he's subjecting Musk to that. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1363.78s)]
*  It's a public humiliation. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1366.8600000000001s)]
*  And Musk is sitting there kind of taking it. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1369.38s)]
*  And one other thing Trump does is in front of Musk, he asks different aides in the room, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1374.38s)]
*  well, would you hire him? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1378.46s)]
*  Would you? Would you hire him? [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1379.5800000000002s)]
*  Would you hire Jared Isaacman? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1381.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Would you do it? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1382.3000000000002s)]
*  And no one really stands up for him in the room. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1383.66s)]
*  And eventually Trump decides to withdraw the nomination of Isaacman. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1386.9s)]
*  So essentially what you and our colleagues have found is that Elon Musk, the first buddy, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1392.46s)]
*  by the time he's on his last day of service in this administration, literally the day [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1399.46s)]
*  that he's saying goodbye to the president, he's deeply wounded. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1404.46s)]
*  He's wounded because the president in his mind has completely undermined the work he's [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1410.46s)]
*  done for Doge and blown a hole in the budget that Elon Musk was trying to do. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1414.9s)]
*  And he's wounded because the president is wounded. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1420.54s)]
*  Elon Musk was trying to shrink by cutting government spending. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1423.62s)]
*  And the president is about to kneecap Musk's choice to run NASA, the single most important [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1428.1399999999999s)]
*  agency in the government to Musk. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1436.02s)]
*  And that wounded Elon Musk is the person who leaves the White House and starts this feud. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1439.1399999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1446.54s)]
*  To say that this is all self-interest from Musk, it's really because the big, beautiful [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1447.7s)]
*  bill got rid of subsidies for electric vehicles. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1453.82s)]
*  And I'm sure there's some truth to him being irritated about the way that they handled [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1457.86s)]
*  electric vehicle subsidies. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1464.3799999999999s)]
*  But what we found in our reporting is that the much more important reasons for this feud [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1465.6599999999999s)]
*  was that Musk felt over a period of weeks that his work for Doge was being canceled [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1472.62s)]
*  out by their tax bill. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1479.22s)]
*  And what you saw in the next few days is Musk moving in his public commentary on X from [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1482.26s)]
*  criticizing the legislation, calling it a disgusting abomination, to attacking Trump [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1489.58s)]
*  personally. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1496.3799999999999s)]
*  Jonathan, let's say for the sake of argument that this relationship really is over or [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1497.98s)]
*  entering a very different stage of itself that's deeply diminished. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1504.8200000000002s)]
*  Who has, based on your reporting, more to lose from it being over, which I guess is [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1510.8600000000001s)]
*  another way of asking which of these men, the president or the world's richest man, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1518.14s)]
*  has greater leverage over the other. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1523.5800000000002s)]
*  I will answer that question, but I think it's really important to take a slight step back [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1527.3000000000002s)]
*  and just understand that Trump doesn't have normal human relationships. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1531.98s)]
*  He is transactional. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1536.7800000000002s)]
*  If he can see value in somebody, if he can see that someone could do something for him, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1538.3000000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump is always open to some form of reconciliation. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1543.8200000000002s)]
*  I flew with Trump on Air Force One on Friday afternoon to New Jersey. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1547.98s)]
*  On the flight, I asked Trump about Musk. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1553.66s)]
*  I said to him, you posted on True Social the other day that a great way to save money [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1557.14s)]
*  for the federal government would be to cancel Elon Musk's billions of dollars worth of [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1561.38s)]
*  contracts with the federal government. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1566.8200000000002s)]
*  I said, how seriously did you take that? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1568.0200000000002s)]
*  And Trump said, well, you know, we're going to look at it. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1570.1000000000001s)]
*  We're going to look at everything. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1571.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, he's got a lot of subsidy, gets a lot of money. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1572.94s)]
*  Then he goes, but I'm only going to do it if it's fair. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1575.3000000000002s)]
*  You know, and it was this sort of like nice companies you've got there. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1577.14s)]
*  It would be a shame if something would happen to them. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1580.42s)]
*  So Trump very well understands that's his leverage. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1582.5400000000002s)]
*  Of course, he has the power to inflict extreme harm on Musk's businesses, which have a [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1587.14s)]
*  huge amount of exposure to the federal government, in particular SpaceX. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1594.38s)]
*  I mean, we've seen that Donald Trump is willing to use the levers of federal power to go [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1598.3000000000002s)]
*  after his enemies, whether it be law firms, Harvard University, you know, go down the [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1603.5800000000002s)]
*  list. So everyone, including Elon Musk, presumably knows that this threat is real. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1608.8600000000001s)]
*  So that's Trump's leverage. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1615.18s)]
*  I think that leverage exceeds any leverage that Elon Musk has. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1617.06s)]
*  But people close to Trump are aware that Musk is not without leverage. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1621.46s)]
*  Right. You know, you can tick through the obvious stuff. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1626.1399999999999s)]
*  He's the richest guy in the world. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1628.62s)]
*  He's the biggest donor in Republican politics. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1630.34s)]
*  But there's also another thing which people don't talk about so much in public, but they'll [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1633.4199999999998s)]
*  certainly talk about privately, which is he's seen a lot. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1637.78s)]
*  He has been allowed into a lot of rooms. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1641.86s)]
*  He had a lot of exposure to very sensitive conversations. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1644.66s)]
*  Right. So people close to Trump think that this probably ends up in some form of a [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1648.74s)]
*  transactional truce. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1653.66s)]
*  They're not going to have this best buddy bromance type relationship that they had [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1655.22s)]
*  before. But I wouldn't be surprised if they come to some form of an agreement where [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1660.5800000000002s)]
*  they don't attack each other personally. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1667.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if there's a financial component to this. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1669.98s)]
*  I mean, Musk had already promised Trump that he would give a hundred million dollars to [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1672.6599999999999s)]
*  his outside groups ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1677.06s)]
*  He hasn't given that money yet. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1680.6999999999998s)]
*  So does Donald Trump say, guess what? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1682.6999999999998s)]
*  The price just went up. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1685.82s)]
*  I don't know whether he will, but he's done similar things before making people pay a [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1687.86s)]
*  price for peace. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1693.1s)]
*  But this is the state of where we're at with these relationships and also with Trump's [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1695.4599999999998s)]
*  exercise of power in his second term. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1700.7s)]
*  Right. And in that way, Jonathan, this doesn't seem entirely unrelated thematically to [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1703.82s)]
*  what is happening right now in Los Angeles. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1710.62s)]
*  Obviously, these are very different situations. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1714.6599999999999s)]
*  But I'm thinking about the word power you just used and Trump's projections of power [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1717.18s)]
*  over the past couple of days. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1723.1399999999999s)]
*  Look, I think what you're seeing in both these instances is the improvised nature. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1724.86s)]
*  Of Trump's government. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1730.34s)]
*  This is one man making decisions very quickly with not really much of a process behind [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1732.1s)]
*  it. You know, Elon Musk asks him to run this thing called Doge. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1739.3s)]
*  Trump says, sure, go for it. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1745.1399999999999s)]
*  Right. And we still don't know exactly what happened behind the scenes with this [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1746.98s)]
*  deployment of the National Guard, but we certainly know it wasn't a normal process. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1751.5s)]
*  And he's doing it over the objections of the state's governor, Gavin Newsom. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1754.74s)]
*  So what we see in both these instances is one man exercising tremendous power with very [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1758.42s)]
*  limited and eroded checks on that power without any real form of an interagency process. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1766.8600000000001s)]
*  So you have high risk, high speed and a lot of cars colliding. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1775.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1787.3400000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1788.5400000000002s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1795.46s)]
*  Here's what else you need to another day. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1803.74s)]
*  The White House, which spent months fighting legal orders to return a man it mistakenly [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1807.6200000000001s)]
*  deported to a prison in El Salvador, has returned him to the U.S. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1813.46s)]
*  Kilmar Abrego-Garcia was flown back on Friday, ending the administration's most high [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1819.1000000000001s)]
*  profile battle with federal courts over the president's immigration policies. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1825.94s)]
*  Abrego-Garcia has landed in the United States to face justice. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1831.22s)]
*  During a news conference, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Abrego-Garcia now faces [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1836.46s)]
*  federal charges of illegally transporting undocumented migrants. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1843.02s)]
*  But it's unclear whether the government has strong evidence to prove that claim. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1847.98s)]
*  Upon completion of the sentence, we anticipate he will be returned to his home country of [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1854.14s)]
*  El Salvador. Today's episode was produced by Rachelle Bonja, Diana Nguyen, Eric Krupke [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnvxDt0Itxs&t=1859.8600000000001s)]
