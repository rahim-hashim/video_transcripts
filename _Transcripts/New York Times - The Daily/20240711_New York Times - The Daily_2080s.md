# 72 Hours Inside Biden’s Campaign to Save His Candidacy
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4KITk1kLRM)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobauro.
*  This is The Daily.
*  For the past three days, Joe Biden has fought to save his re-election campaign as panicked
*  congressional Democrats returned to Washington and openly debated whether to call on him
*  to step aside.
*  Today, my colleagues in Washington go inside the 72 hours that could make or break Biden's
*  nomination.
*  It's Thursday, July 11th.
*  As the sun rose on Monday morning, President Biden's nomination was already under siege.
*  Over the weekend, despite Biden's repeated claims that he would not drop out of the race,
*  a handful of senior House Democrats said that they thought he needed to end his candidacy
*  during a conference call that quickly leaked out.
*  One of them, Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee,
*  went public on CNN and joined a small but growing list of sitting Democratic lawmakers
*  saying publicly that Biden had to go.
*  Where are you on this issue?
*  What's your message to President Biden and to your fellow Democrats?
*  Well, look, I think you should step aside.
*  I think it's clear that you should not step aside.
*  Meanwhile, our colleagues at the Times were privately talking with congressional Democrats
*  who had stayed quiet.
*  And they told us that a resounding number of those Democrats wanted Biden out.
*  One of them estimated that in all his communication with lawmakers and their aides, it was about
*  nine to one against Biden.
*  So Monday morning was supposed to be a reset, but it didn't offer much relief.
*  It was a terrible night and I really regret it happened.
*  Age, age wasn't, you know.
*  Biden went on a pretty sympathetic TV show, Morning Joe, on MSNBC, but the questions were
*  anything but gentle.
*  Have you been tested for any age-related illnesses, pre-Parkinson's or anything like that, that
*  might explain sort of having a night like that where you couldn't finish sentences?
*  And his performance was pretty wobbly.
*  And the folks out there and the local, you know, race, you know.
*  Close listeners could hear him shuffling papers and seeming to read from notes.
*  I'm not going to share people's names from here, but the president, I can tell you, has
*  seen a neurologist three times.
*  And at the White House, there was an ugly press conference in which reporters and Biden's
*  press secretary argued over the disclosure of visits from a doctor who specializes in
*  Parkinson's disease.
*  That's a basic direct question.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  Hold on, hold on.
*  Wait, wait, wait.
*  Which sparked a new round of negative headlines.
*  Guys, guys, hold on a second.
*  There's no reason to get back and go back and forth and be in this aggressive way.
*  We have a little mist around here about how information's been shared with the press
*  board out here.
*  What are you mist about?
*  What are you mist about?
*  Everything he just asked about.
*  What do you, and then every time I come back and I answer the question that you guys asked.
*  It was not a good day for Joe Biden.
*  But this one thing becomes the exception.
*  It's this letter to congressional Democrats that the president sent just as they were
*  gathering at the Capitol for the first time in weeks.
*  Yeah, the president sent this letter specifically to tell them he is not leaving the race and
*  that they should stop, in effect, speculating about it.
*  I spoke to my colleague, Chief White House correspondent Peter Baker, shortly after the
*  letter came out on Monday.
*  This letter says to them, pay attention to what I'm saying.
*  I'm not getting out.
*  I'm in it to win.
*  Get over it, in effect.
*  He writes, quote, the question of how to move forward has been well aired for over a week
*  now, and it's time for it to end.
*  We have one job, and that is to beat Donald Trump.
*  And that's the point, right?
*  Is he saying, I've heard you and I'm not going to get out.
*  So if you don't stop talking about me getting out, you're going to make it harder for us
*  to defeat Donald Trump.
*  Right.
*  He's saying, in essence, you can't have this debate anymore because this debate, it
*  undermines my chances.
*  Exactly.
*  And therefore, I want you to shut up.
*  This question is over.
*  Knock it off.
*  Move on.
*  And I think he's daring them, daring his doubters and naysayers to come after him or to shut
*  up.
*  You want to take me on?
*  Take me on.
*  Right.
*  It's the old saying, right?
*  If you're going to shoot at the king, you better not miss.
*  So all eyes right now are on congressional Democrats to see where they fall this week.
*  Do the floodgates open and they end up abandoning him in large numbers or do they decide to
*  give up on that notion?
*  And that's the big question, right?
*  That may determine whether Joe Biden, at the end of this week, is still the party
*  nominee.
*  Hey, this is Katie Edmondson.
*  It is Tuesday morning, a little after 9 a.m.
*  And like a few dozen other reporters, I am standing outside the National Democratic
*  Club on a very humid 90 degree Washington morning because Democratic lawmakers are
*  meeting inside trying to figure out whether President Biden has a viable path forward
*  to run for reelection.
*  And there have been a number of efforts to keep this meeting under lock and key.
*  Of course, that's easier said than done when you have 200 plus people in a room.
*  Among those 200 people are some prominent Black and Latino House Democrats who Biden
*  had spent the past few days aggressively courting ahead of this meeting.
*  And the theory is that if they spoke up for Biden in this room, it would be harder for
*  everyone else to speak against him.
*  We're seeing some members streaming late into the meeting now and we will all be anxiously
*  waiting to hear what they determined when they leave.
*  An hour passed, two hours passed.
*  Text from one member says the meeting is still going.
*  Four or five speakers so far, no consensus.
*  A small trickle of lawmakers left the meeting early, deflecting questions from reporters
*  as they walked by.
*  And then finally, there's a stream of lawmakers.
*  The meeting is over.
*  Some were tight lipped.
*  Is there consensus?
*  For those who did talk, there was no clear consensus.
*  Congresswoman, how was the meeting this morning?
*  Meeting's good.
*  Some praised the meeting.
*  Wonderful meeting.
*  Some did not.
*  Congresswoman, can you just describe the mood in the room amongst members this morning?
*  Very nasty.
*  Very nasty.
*  Later, some would paint the mood inside the meeting as really bleak.
*  But outside, many just stared grimly and silently ahead as reporters peppered them with questions.
*  Some rallied behind President Biden.
*  Joe Biden is, will be, and should be our nominee.
*  And if you would give me space so I can call my staff and please cease asking me questions.
*  Some of the Democrats held the same views that they had before the meeting, like
*  Congressman Lloyd Doggett, the first Democrat to come out and ask Biden to step down as nominee.
*  He is a great man who's made a great contribution to the country.
*  But you shouldn't leave a legacy that endangers us that we surrender to the power.
*  Others just backtracked.
*  Representative Jerry Nadler, one of the senior House Democrats who had come out against Biden
*  on that leaked conference call, started to basically reverse course.
*  He is the person who's going to do it.
*  He's going to be a nominee.
*  What changed your mind then?
*  Again, remember, only he can withdraw.
*  He's made it very clear that he won't.
*  And that's the end of the story.
*  Do you guys, do you guys?
*  What was, was there more people saying Biden took a step down or more people saying he took a step down?
*  We're riding with Biden.
*  We're riding with Biden.
*  And Congressman James Clyburn, a key black lawmaker who earlier in the week
*  seemed open to finding another nominee, rushed past reporters, repeating,
*  We're riding with Biden.
*  We are riding with Biden.
*  We are riding with Biden.
*  We are riding with Biden.
*  Was everybody closing their car?
*  Nine times.
*  We are riding with Biden.
*  Was that the consensus from everyone in the room?
*  We're riding with Biden.
*  Do you still support the idea that Biden took a step down?
*  But it seemed the only real consensus was that there was no consensus.
*  In fact, one House Democrat coming out of the meeting was asked if Democrats are all on the same page.
*  And his response was, we're not even in the same book.
*  So for right now, we really do not see an answer emerging to the question that everyone wants to know,
*  which is, will Democrats stay united behind Biden?
*  A couple of hours later, it was Senate Democrats' turn to talk about Biden's future.
*  They convened for a weekly luncheon.
*  And the space just outside where they gathered was, once again, packed with reporters, including our own.
*  Annie Carney, Katie Edmondson, and Robert Jimison.
*  All right, so this is Robert again.
*  We are on the Senate side.
*  This is Katie Edmondson.
*  It is just before 2 30 in the Capitol.
*  And we are standing outside the closed door meeting of Senate Democrats who are at their weekly luncheon.
*  There is sort of odd split screen between their private comments and their public comments.
*  That has been particularly true here in the Senate.
*  And so we're going to wait to see what they come out and say after this meeting.
*  But I don't think the expectations are high that there's going to be any major break
*  toward trying to get the president to step down as the party nominee.
*  It was a good discussion, good discussion.
*  Was there anything?
*  Good discussion.
*  That's all I have.
*  After their luncheon, Senate Democrats trickled out of the room and were reluctant to really say much of anything.
*  I'm not going to be a news source.
*  You want to know what I ate?
*  No.
*  You personally feel coming out of that.
*  We got a ways to go.
*  But you know, we're not going to negotiate out in public.
*  So it was constructive.
*  Was there consensus?
*  Constructive.
*  Constructive.
*  Constructive.
*  Very constructive.
*  The protesters said that was like constructive.
*  I think it was.
*  I think that's all I'd been able to say.
*  They rehearsed these lines.
*  But in the few things that they did say, it was clear that the senators
*  weren't going to go any further toward pushing Biden out.
*  I still stand by the statement.
*  Take Senator John Tester of Montana, for instance, who is locked in a tight re-election battle this fall.
*  A week ago, he issued a statement saying, quote,
*  President Biden has got to prove to the American people, including me,
*  that he's up to the job for another four years.
*  That means that you think that he should drop out?
*  I have not spoken to the president.
*  Should he drop out?
*  And the statement is worth my human trust.
*  Give it back.
*  He refused to budge or in any way elaborate that position.
*  Is Joe Biden the candidate that can beat Trump?
*  Joe Biden is the Democratic candidate and he has my support.
*  He said unequivocally and emphatically that he intends to be the candidate.
*  And I think he will continue to have my support and the support of a lot of people in that room.
*  And so what you had were a bunch of Democratic senators pledging their loyalty to Biden
*  in this pretty tepid way.
*  They weren't making an affirmative case for him.
*  They were saying, we're going to stick with him.
*  All right.
*  Now this week, Senate Democrats intend to pick up where we left off in June.
*  And that was really summed up by the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer,
*  one of really just a handful of Democrats who could change this debate.
*  He was asked about Biden at a news conference.
*  Are you confident that President Biden has what it takes to win in November
*  and serve the next four years?
*  As I've said before, I'm with Joe.
*  Yes.
*  And he affirmed his support for Biden every time, almost as a reflex.
*  Is there the ability to throw out the virtual nomination?
*  As I've said before, I'm with Joe.
*  Yes. No, don't yell.
*  Way in the back, right there.
*  Over and over again.
*  Do you agree with her sentiment?
*  As I've said before, I'm with Joe.
*  Senator Schumer, does it leave Democrats in a difficult position?
*  Okay, it's Katie Edmondson.
*  It's now Tuesday night, approaching 6 p.m. here on Capitol Hill.
*  And the state of play is basically this.
*  A lot of deep concerns the Democrats privately are happy to discuss,
*  but there just aren't that many of them who are willing to go public with these fears.
*  And a big data point on that is that the Democratic leaders here on the Hill
*  are solidly behind him.
*  So right now, it feels like the prospect of a full-fledged congressional rebellion
*  of Democrats linking arms and saying, Mr. President, you need to step down,
*  is just not going to happen.
*  After the break, I speak with a Democratic congressman who has called on Biden to step aside
*  and is becoming increasingly frustrated at colleagues who agree with him,
*  but refuse to publicly say so.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Representative Smith, good morning, and thank you for taking some time to talk with us today.
*  We really appreciate it.
*  Well, thanks for giving me the chance.
*  Adam Smith represents the 9th congressional district in Washington state.
*  So I just want to start with a very simple question.
*  Did you ever think that the Democratic Party would be in the situation that it is in right now?
*  Well, I try not to place limits on my imagination.
*  I've seen a lot of things.
*  People make decisions for a lot of bizarre reasons and you wind up in places for reasons
*  you wouldn't expect.
*  So I don't know if I would say I never imagined it.
*  I will certainly say that I am deeply troubled by it.
*  Well, let's go there.
*  I mean, we're talking to you.
*  And the reason why we are eager to talk to you of all people is because you were among
*  the first senior Democrats in Congress, a leader of the Democratic Party.
*  And you were among the first senior Democrats in Congress, a leader of your party, to come out and say that you thought President Biden should step aside as the party's nominee.
*  And you did it in a moment when it seemed like his support in Congress might be crumbling.
*  And that was on Sunday and a little bit into Monday as well.
*  And obviously a lot has changed since then, which we will get to.
*  Walk us through, Congressman, how you got to that point where you did feel compelled to say that the Democratic Party needs a new nominee.
*  Did that start with the debate or did it go back further?
*  Actually, this goes back a long way.
*  I could give you the origin story here.
*  And please.
*  First thing was, so Joe Biden ran, you know, people like, okay, he's old.
*  Okay, but damn, you know, he did a good job.
*  We got there.
*  And I think there was a certain assumption that he would serve one term.
*  Now, I've been around this business a long time.
*  I never bought into that as such.
*  Okay.
*  People are very reluctant to step away in my experience, but okay.
*  So and then he moves through it and he's going to run again.
*  And from the very start, I was concerned about that because of his age.
*  So, you know, two years ago, I had some conversations like, really, are we just, we're just going to roll with the president.
*  And the thing is, nobody was interested in running against him.
*  And I had a number of conversations with different people who were having similar thoughts, members of Congress, you know, politicos, other folks.
*  And the general gist was, look, Joe's done a good job as president.
*  You know, if we get into a food fight of a primary, there's a risk.
*  So it's going to be fine.
*  So nobody decided to run against him.
*  And I said, okay, let's go.
*  So you're worried, but you made peace with it.
*  Yeah, yeah, I was a little nervous about it.
*  And then the debate happened.
*  And two friends of mine texted me, 10 minutes into the debate.
*  One said, oh, my God, are you watching this?
*  It's a disaster.
*  And I'm like, yeah, what?
*  And then another friend of mine just said, SOS, come on, Joe.
*  All right.
*  And I was like, uh-oh.
*  So I've watched a lot of debates throughout the years and I've seen a lot of bad debates.
*  Okay.
*  The inability to get a coherent sentence out, the inability to find the words was something I had never seen before in a debate.
*  And I saw how the country reacted to it.
*  I mean, Donald Trump gave the second worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates, but nobody paid any attention to it.
*  It was really bad.
*  And at that moment, I felt like two things.
*  One, Joe Biden, is he not an effective messenger?
*  And the frustration for me as a Democrat, we've got a great message.
*  Okay.
*  I've ran when we as Democrats didn't have a great message.
*  We've got a great message this time.
*  All right.
*  Joe Biden and the Democrats have delivered during his time as president and Donald Trump is an existential threat to the country.
*  A great message.
*  And you watch that debate and if you're a Democrat and you're just begging him to fight back, to say something, to get our message out there.
*  And look, we've got a lot of people out there who can very clearly articulate our message, but the voters, they're going to look to that top person.
*  And if that top person can't say it, it's going to hurt in a big way.
*  So that's what crystallized after the debate.
*  I called the White House the day after the debate.
*  What did you say?
*  I said, he's got to get out.
*  I said, it's just that's just where we're at.
*  Look, I'm weird.
*  I kind of say what I think.
*  I don't believe in tiptoeing up the things.
*  Either you're going to say it or you're not.
*  I said, look, I'm not going to make a snap decision here.
*  I'll give you guys some space.
*  I'm not saying anything.
*  And I kept talking to the White House campaign people throughout that.
*  And it became clear that that wasn't going to happen.
*  And I felt like I got to try.
*  It's just too important.
*  And so of the series of options that were in front of me, the only one that made any
*  sense was for me to do whatever I could in my power to get us a different nominee.
*  I felt like I had no choice but to pursue that avenue.
*  So that's where how I wound up there.
*  I'm curious what you heard from your constituents after the debate.
*  Clearly, you come to the conclusion.
*  Panic.
*  Universal panic.
*  Okay.
*  And these are these are Democrats.
*  I think our listeners should understand you represent a very Democratic district,
*  parts of Seattle.
*  Everybody was absolutely panicked.
*  Let me tell you, they didn't have a plan.
*  Okay.
*  It was just, oh, my God, what are we going to do?
*  Because I can't see how the president Biden, who was on that stage, beats Donald Trump.
*  I mean, that's basically what they were saying.
*  We can't win.
*  And what, Congressman, about your colleagues on the Hill, your Democratic fellow House
*  members, what were you hearing from them?
*  After the debate?
*  Exact same thing with a couple of exceptions.
*  There's a couple of people who were, that's all fine.
*  But overwhelmingly, yeah, 90% of people were same thing.
*  I think the differences and part of the problem is a lot of members of Congress have personal
*  relationships with the president or with people close to him.
*  And I think if anything explains why they had more of an initial pause, that's it.
*  They didn't want to go there that quick.
*  They have too much respect for the man.
*  And I respect that.
*  I do.
*  But your average Democratic voter across the country, it was panic.
*  So what were you weighing at that point?
*  Was this a moment at all of soul searching for you as you weighed what to do with these
*  feelings?
*  You know, you've concluded something has to be done.
*  Your constituents are clearly concluding something has to be done.
*  A lot of your colleagues think it sounds like that something has to be done.
*  But doing something on the order of what it sounds like you're thinking of doing in
*  this moment is not simple.
*  It's not easy.
*  It's not polite.
*  I have always had what I like to refer to as a problem solving mentality.
*  And I looked at it and said, OK, what are our options here?
*  If he's our nominee, what's going to happen?
*  Not going to be good.
*  Is there an option to not have him be our nominee?
*  He is the presumptive nominee.
*  We haven't nominated him yet.
*  And by the way, for all these people saying yes, but 14 million people voted for him,
*  let's put those 14 million people in a booth with the ballot in their hand,
*  have them watch that 90 minute debate, and then let's ask them how they're voting.
*  OK, they have that option.
*  So it's a different situation.
*  And I believe that the delegates to our convention have an obligation to pick the person
*  who's going to put them in the best position to win, particularly in this situation.
*  So I went right to it very quickly.
*  In your mind, did you feel that more and more lawmakers were about to come forward at that
*  moment?
*  I mean, you said just a few moments ago that something like 90% of the colleagues that
*  you've interacted with are just as worried as you are about Biden not being able to win.
*  Did it feel like momentum was tilting in that direction?
*  As an observer, I thought that was a very strong possibility.
*  Yeah, there was a lot of momentum there.
*  But it's a big thing to come out and say what I said.
*  And what we've seen really is a whole lot of people who are trying to straddle without
*  going one way or the other.
*  People talk about how I think there's only seven of us who have come out and said you
*  should be removed.
*  But there's a whole lot of other people who have said, I have concerns.
*  OK, wonderful.
*  I didn't elect you to have concerns.
*  I elected you to make decisions.
*  And there's a decision to be made here.
*  But what people are trying to do, I think there's still a large block of people who
*  are like, I just hope he does the right thing.
*  And does that annoy you?
*  Is that frustrating for you?
*  Well, the idea that we are going to slow walk into fascism because we don't want to hurt
*  somebody that we respect's feelings.
*  I cannot even begin to tell you how angry that makes me.
*  Let me just try to translate what I think you're just saying here.
*  You think that your colleagues are sparing President Biden's feelings.
*  They don't want to hurt his feelings by calling on him to step down.
*  And as a result, they are putting themselves on a path to having him lose the election
*  and Trump win.
*  I think that is a factor.
*  Let me also say there is a reasonable argument on the other side of this.
*  I disagree with it.
*  OK, the reasonable argument is there's nothing we can do.
*  He's gonna run.
*  OK, there is no way we can get him out of there.
*  So it doesn't make sense to criticize him in any way.
*  But I would suggest for the people who think that that you have to come up with a better
*  argument than the two that have been trotted out thus far.
*  Number one is he had a bad night, nothing to see here.
*  Everything's fine.
*  That's just something past the last test for most Americans.
*  Number two is, look, he's the only guy running.
*  So I'm with him and I'm not answering any more of your questions.
*  You saw that yesterday.
*  I'm with Joe.
*  We're riding with Biden.
*  Well, what do you think about his health?
*  Do you think he can make through four years?
*  We're riding with Biden.
*  I'm with Joe.
*  That's not going to fly either.
*  So it sounds like what you're saying is that for many of your colleagues,
*  the decision has come down to the president doesn't want to drop out of the race.
*  And therefore, what's the point in sticking our necks out and asking him to do it?
*  He doesn't want to do it.
*  Exactly.
*  And the other argument is that speaking out as you have hurts President Biden
*  while he's not willing to get out of the race.
*  So again, what's the point?
*  And since that Biden letter came out, what we've ended up seeing over the past couple of days
*  is that a lot of your colleagues have gone quiet.
*  The air in the room has shifted and the winds seem to be turning to fall in line.
*  Don't rebel.
*  And for some Democrats, what's been striking about that dynamic and about this moment
*  is that it feels based on everything you've said, based on what our colleagues are reporting about,
*  the depth of concern among Democrats, it feels to some Democrats like their own party
*  is now engaged in the kind of conduct that they've long accused Republicans
*  of engaging in the Trump era, which is saying one thing in private about their party's leader
*  that they don't approve of him.
*  And then going out in public and saying something different, which is,
*  he has my support.
*  I'm loyal.
*  Does that analogy ring to you?
*  And does it worry you?
*  Let me just say, and I say this strongly and with full belief,
*  there is no comparison between what Donald Trump is and what Joe Biden is.
*  No comparison whatsoever.
*  I'm asking about the party.
*  I know what you're asking and I'm going to get there.
*  This first point needs to be made.
*  Joe Biden is a good man who has served his country incredibly well for going on 60 years now.
*  Donald Trump is a criminal who tried to overthrow this country's government and
*  overturn a legitimate election.
*  He is convicted.
*  He is a horrific human being.
*  So any effort to compare the two, I find objectionable.
*  However, to your average voter,
*  Yeah, it looks similar in a way that I think undermines our ability to deliver that message
*  that I just delivered.
*  I mean, how does that leave you feeling?
*  It makes me frustrated and angry and frankly motivated.
*  You know, I'm not giving up until he is the official nominee.
*  I think we've got to look at this from a realistic standpoint.
*  Well, let me just ask you, it feels like there are a few possibilities for what happens now.
*  One is that Biden remains the nominee and he loses.
*  And that's what polling data suggests at the moment could happen.
*  Trump's lead is growing.
*  And in that scenario, your colleagues have kind of put themselves on what could be described
*  as a kind of slow death march toward the election.
*  And they're handing the election to someone they say is a threat to democracy.
*  The other possibility is that you're totally wrong.
*  And that Biden stays on the ticket.
*  He wins the race.
*  You were among a handful of doubters who tried to take him out.
*  And you were just wrong and wrong in an epic, historic way.
*  I want you to just sit with both possibilities for a minute.
*  Sure. And let me just tell you one thing.
*  I'm not wrong.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not wrong at all.
*  It's not debatable at this point that we can do better than Joe Biden for a candidate in the fall.
*  What is possible is that he could still win.
*  I'm not going to say he can't win.
*  What I am saying and what I challenge any sentient being to disagree with me on is
*  we would have a better chance of winning, a much better chance of winning,
*  if we had a different candidate at the top of the ticket.
*  That's my argument.
*  How vocal do you intend to be?
*  How far are you going to keep sticking your neck out in a world where the rest of the party
*  is looking at you with a little bit of a stink eye and as a little bit of a lonely anomaly
*  like a Cassandra standing there, you know, shouting into the wind?
*  Sure. First of all, literally hundreds of people have thanked me for doing what I did all across
*  the board. People, you know, just across the board.
*  So I don't have a problem in terms of a couple of people looking at me aghast.
*  A lot of people looking at me say, thank God somebody said something.
*  Okay. Second of all, as I said earlier, until he is the official nominee of this party,
*  I'm of the opinion that he shouldn't be.
*  And I'm going to keep doing that.
*  Once he becomes the official nominee of the party, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
*  What I'm going to do is I'm going to say vote for Joe Biden.
*  Okay. He needs to win this election.
*  So you will fall in line.
*  At that point, it's not falling in line.
*  Okay. There are five people on the ballot.
*  All right. And I'm going to support somebody for president and not going to be Donald Trump.
*  It's not going to be whatever crazy stuff RFK Jr. is talking about.
*  It's not going to be Cornell West. It's going to be Joe Biden.
*  Do you think that this debate over the president's candidacy is now over?
*  Not quite.
*  I'm the guy who keeps looking back on it.
*  Okay. Yeah. I know they're down three touchdowns since mid fourth quarter,
*  but maybe if they throw a bomb and they fumble to kick off, you know, so it ain't over till
*  it's over, as they say. And like I said, it ain't over until he's officially nominated.
*  Well, congressman.
*  Thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it.
*  Thanks. Thanks for your minutes.
*  After we spoke with Congressman Smith, an eighth member of the house democratic caucus,
*  representative Pat Ryan of New York asked Biden to end his campaign.
*  Soon after Peter Welch of Vermont became the first U.S. senator to ask Biden to quit.
*  Meanwhile, in an interview on Wednesday, an unexpected voice said that he hoped Biden
*  would remain in the race. Former president Trump.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to know today.
*  The leaders of NATO have agreed that Ukraine should have an irreversible path to membership
*  in the military alliance and plan to enshrine that commitment in a document to be released
*  this week during a NATO summit in Washington. The plan is motivated in part by fears of a
*  Trump victory this fall. Trump openly admires Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered
*  Putin, who ordered the invasion of Ukraine, is skeptical of U.S. military aid to Ukraine
*  and has repeatedly questioned the point of NATO. As a result, NATO leaders are trying in their words
*  to Trump proof both NATO and Ukraine's ability to join it.
*  And today's episode was produced by Lindsay Garrison, Jessica Chung and Diana Nguyen.
