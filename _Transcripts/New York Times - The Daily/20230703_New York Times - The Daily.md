# A Clash Between Religious Faith and Gay Rights
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOaNvYsdalE)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered another major decision on the last day of its term,
*  ruling in favor of a web designer who argued that having to create websites for same-sex
*  marriages violated her right to free speech.
*  Today, my colleague Adam Liptak on how the ruling puts freedom of expression above freedom
*  from discrimination and what that might mean for all kinds of different groups of Americans.
*  It's Monday, July 3rd.
*  Adam, you're back.
*  Hello, Sabrina.
*  So this time, you're here for another major case, one potentially with far-reaching consequences
*  for same-sex couples.
*  Tell me about the ruling.
*  So this is the end of June when we get the big cases, and this is one we've been waiting
*  for for many months.
*  The question is whether a website designer with religious convictions can refuse to provide
*  services to same-sex couples for same-sex marriages.
*  And the court, by the usual six to three split with the six Republican appointees in the
*  majority, says yes, she can.
*  She has a First Amendment free speech right not to be compelled by the government to say
*  things she doesn't believe.
*  She says that same-sex marriages are false and that in having to comply with a Colorado
*  anti-discrimination law that forbids discrimination on many grounds, including sexual orientation,
*  the government is making her violate her free speech rights by compelling her to say something
*  she doesn't believe.
*  In other words, she has the right not to make a website for same-sex couples who are getting
*  married because they're same-sex couples, something she disagrees with.
*  Right, and there is an established First Amendment doctrine called compelled speech that says
*  you can't force school children to say the Pledge of Allegiance, you can't require people
*  to in New Hampshire have a license plate that says live free or die, and whether that concept
*  fits neatly here is open to question.
*  But the Supreme Court adopts that concept, or the majority does, and says that this anti-discrimination
*  as applied to a web designer engaged in expressive conduct violates the First Amendment.
*  This is sounding vaguely familiar.
*  I'm thinking about that case a while back about a cake baker who didn't want to bake
*  a cake for a same-sex wedding also in Colorado.
*  It was about five miles away from where this web designer works.
*  Wow.
*  You're right to remember that case.
*  It involved a baker named Jack Phillips who made custom wedding cakes.
*  He said they were artistic works, and he refused service to a same-sex couple, was punished
*  for it.
*  That case went all the way to the Supreme Court, but we didn't get a definitive decision
*  in that case.
*  And remind me why, Adam, what happened?
*  I think the real reason was that the controlling vote was that of Justice Anthony Kennedy since
*  retired.
*  Justice Kennedy was on the one hand the court's greatest proponent of gay rights, the author
*  of all four major constitutional pro-gay rights decisions, but also very sensitive to First
*  Amendment free speech concerns.
*  And I just don't think he could make up his mind.
*  So he ultimately found an off-ramp ruling in favor of the baker on quite narrow technical
*  idiosyncratic grounds.
*  None of that is important to follow.
*  The only larger point is that there was no decision, and we've been waiting now for years
*  for the Supreme Court to return to this topic.
*  Okay, so now this case comes along with this web designer.
*  Tell me about her, the person at the heart of the case.
*  Her name is Lori Smith.
*  I paid her a visit some months ago as the case was soon to be argued.
*  So Lori, tell me about you, tell me about your business.
*  What do you do here?
*  So you're in my studio.
*  This is 303 Creative here in Littleton, Colorado.
*  And she told me her story.
*  So I'm from a family of entrepreneurs.
*  I always wanted to own my own business and I've always been creative.
*  She starts her own business, which makes ads and logos and websites.
*  Custom logos, custom artwork, custom designs.
*  For a variety of businesses.
*  Nothing I create, no two things are the same.
*  So everything's custom expression and artwork in nature.
*  And she sees herself as an artist and thinks that every piece of work she does for this
*  business is unique.
*  So my clients are coming to me because they're not looking for like a boilerplate template.
*  And she also says she's eager to go into a new business.
*  She wants to provide websites for weddings.
*  When I started creating, I made a decision that the things that I create and design for,
*  it would be honoring and glorifying to God.
*  And because of that, that means that I can't create all messages.
*  But she says her Christian faith would not allow her to create websites for same sex
*  weddings.
*  And I want to create weddings consistent with my faith, which teaches me that marriage is
*  between one man and one woman.
*  She says she'll serve gay couples in all kinds of settings.
*  I love everyone.
*  I serve everyone.
*  I have a client who identifies LGBT.
*  I just can't promote every message.
*  Just not in connection with same sex marriages.
*  But the state says that I can't do that.
*  And she's afraid that if she goes into this business, but only serves opposite sex couples,
*  she'll be punished by the state of Colorado under its anti-discrimination laws.
*  For me, I cautiously looked around at the nature of the environment in Colorado.
*  And I saw what was happening with people like Jack Phillips, who has a similar faith to
*  me.
*  And I wondered if the state could do the same to me.
*  And she thinks that because she's actually familiar with the Cake Baker case, she knows
*  Jack Phillips, the baker in the case.
*  And she knew she might run the risk of getting in trouble with Colorado, as he did, if she
*  were to turn down business based on same sex marriages.
*  So how did you get involved in this lawsuit?
*  Well, it started about six years ago.
*  And so she gets together with a big Christian litigating firm called Alliance Defending Freedom,
*  which had also represented Jack Phillips.
*  And they file suit.
*  And they do so before she's actually opened her doors to this kind of business.
*  They say that she has reason to be afraid that she'll face punishment if she starts
*  into this business but won't serve same sex couples for same sex weddings.
*  And so rather than wait to be punished, I decided to take a stand to protect my First
*  Amendment rights.
*  And I shouldn't have to be punished before I challenge an unjust law.
*  So there's really not a real life dispute here, right?
*  She's just trying to kind of head off the potential for a dispute that she thinks she
*  might have if she expands her business.
*  Right.
*  In the case with the Cake Baker, there was detailed record evidence in the court files
*  on who had done what, when, and it really added some texture and context to the case.
*  In this case, Smith said she had received but never responded to a request from what
*  looked like a same sex couple.
*  Now, according to recent reports, the request was bogus, submitted under the name of a straight
*  man.
*  But in any event, the case is very different from that of the Baker.
*  Right.
*  He actually had denied baking a cake to an actual couple, right?
*  So as you say, they were facts in the case.
*  And even though she's not here, she hasn't denied service to anyone, it's kind of something
*  that might happen in the future.
*  Right.
*  So we don't know what the request would look like.
*  We don't know what any resulting website would look like.
*  It's an odd thing to have a Supreme Court decision based on so little evidence.
*  But obviously, nonetheless, the case makes it all the way up to the Supreme Court.
*  Right.
*  It's hard to think that Alliance Defending Freedom had wanted to find another plaintiff
*  in another case to get back to the Supreme Court, particularly as its composition had
*  changed, as it had become more conservative.
*  And when the case arrives at the Supreme Court, it seems like a sequel to the case about the
*  Baker.
*  And it is.
*  But the Baker's case had two pieces to it.
*  It had a religious component, whether the Colorado Antidiscrimination Law violated his
*  right to free exercise of religion, and also whether it violated his right to free speech,
*  to free expression.
*  Okay.
*  This time around, the court only grants the free speech question.
*  So we're looking at a case which has heavy overtones of a classic clash between religion
*  and gay rights.
*  But it takes the form of a question about free speech.
*  Okay.
*  So instead of this being a fight about religion and free speech versus discrimination, it's
*  just free speech versus discrimination.
*  Right.
*  The court apparently thought the best way to handle this question is in a streamlined
*  and really bear down on whether the First Amendment's free expression protection applies
*  even in the face of an anti-discrimination law.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Okay.
*  So how did we get to this ruling from the Supreme Court last week?
*  Well, after the court agrees to hear the case, they hear argument in December.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  Laurie Smith blends art with technology.
*  And it starts by Laurie Smith's lawyer, Kristen Wagoner, getting up and making basically the
*  same points that Smith made to me.
*  ... that she has religious convictions.
*  She shouldn't be forced to violate them by saying things she doesn't believe.
*  That the First Amendment protects her in this area.
*  And what did the justices make of that argument?
*  Well, the justices were really trying to sort out what kinds of businesses are we talking
*  about that can invoke the First Amendment at all.
*  How do you characterize website designers?
*  Are they more like the restaurants and the jewelers and the tailors?
*  Or are they more like the publishing houses and the other free speech analogs that are
*  raised on the other side?
*  Many people would agree that a painter, a songwriter, the ghostwriter of a biography
*  engages in First Amendment protected activity and therefore might have a claim.
*  But not, for example, a shoe store or Walmart or a tire company.
*  Right.
*  If you're just any regular business facing the public, you don't have those rights if
*  what you're selling isn't your own expression.
*  So the two ends of the spectrum are pretty well defined.
*  I thought that there really isn't that clear a distinction in a situation like this.
*  That didn't answer the question about whether this web designer in this context was engaging
*  in expression.
*  Thank you.
*  Can I give you a hypothetical?
*  It's not really a hypothetical.
*  This Elena Kagan, for instance, says, what if what you're offering is basically a template?
*  You have lots of graphics.
*  You have typefaces.
*  And basically, clients are coming in and they're saying, we just want a standard website that
*  tells people where to stay and how to travel there.
*  And the question is, can a website designer say, sorry, that's not my kind of marriage?
*  Does that amount to Laurie Smith's expression?
*  How much creativity does she need to bring to the project?
*  So I think that if I understand you, you're saying, yes, she can refuse because there's
*  ideology just in the fact that it's Mike and Harry and there's a picture of these two guys
*  together.
*  And in this speech, you are announcing a wedding.
*  There were questions about how much will people understand the resulting speech to be hers
*  as opposed to the couples.
*  So what's the message if it says save the date, Lillian, Lillian, Lillian, marry?
*  What's the message there?
*  That's an invitation to celebrate a marriage.
*  But why is it your invitation?
*  So I mean, if you look at a wedding website, are you going to go, well, that's interesting
*  what Laurie Smith thinks about same sex marriage?
*  Or are you going to think, here's something that perhaps in consultation with an artist,
*  but nevertheless was created by and is the speech of the couple?
*  Another major question is, how broadly would a ruling in favor of Laurie Smith sweep?
*  Can I ask you a hypothetical that just sort of helps me to flesh that out?
*  Ms. Katanji Brown Jackson, for instance, asked an interesting hypothetical question.
*  Can you give me your thoughts on a photography business in a shopping mall during this holiday
*  season that offers a product called Scenes with Santa?
*  And this business wants to express its own view of nostalgia.
*  Let's assume a shopping mall wants to have a kind of 1950s sepia-toned Christmas setting
*  in which they say black children shouldn't participate because that's not their vision
*  of what the 1950s in America was all about.
*  Would that be acceptable?
*  That's a kind of speech, I guess, setting up a Christmas scene in a shopping mall.
*  And are you allowed to discriminate that way?
*  So she seems to be suggesting that a ruling in favor of Smith could actually go way beyond
*  a web designer's religious objections, that it could be a slippery slope.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  This court has protected vile, awful, reprehensible, violent speech in the past, and it is never
*  come to pass.
*  No, I'm just asking you, why is the objection?
*  An important point to recognize is that, let's recall, we're not talking about religious
*  belief alone.
*  We're talking about any belief.
*  And that belief can be quite ugly.
*  It can be an anti-Muslim belief.
*  It can be the idea that women shouldn't participate in the workforce.
*  It could protect all kinds of discrimination, so long as we're talking about expressive
*  speech delivered on a custom basis.
*  Got it.
*  Meanwhile, some of the conservative justices suggested there might be a slippery slope
*  in the other direction as well.
*  The problem, and what a lot of the hypotheticals are getting at, is however we decide this
*  case obviously applies to others.
*  And in court, the justices were grappling with, well, where would the line be if this
*  Colorado law was left in place?
*  Couldn't that leave the door open to at least some companies having to take on all kinds
*  of work that they deeply disagree with?
*  Does every press release writer, freelance writer, have to write a press release for
*  the Church of Scientology, say, even though the beliefs of that institution may be inimical
*  to that person?
*  And the more the justices talk, the more it becomes apparent that they're finding these
*  questions to be pretty hard.
*  You could say I...
*  So the answer is yes, Colorado would compel that person.
*  No, no.
*  The answer is no.
*  Okay, why?
*  Because Colorado...
*  So there are, as lawyers like to say, a lot of line drawing questions here.
*  At the conclusion of the argument, though, I think I thought, and most observers thought,
*  that the Sixth Justice conservative majority would find a way to rule for Laurie Smith,
*  was basically sympathetic to her position.
*  And that may have been inflected by the particular context of the case, that she was a Christian
*  woman opposed to same-sex marriage.
*  And this is a court that's very receptive to claims based on religion, particularly
*  from Christians.
*  And maybe is not as sympathetic in cases involving gay rights as it might be in other cases involving
*  other forms of discrimination.
*  And of course, Adam, you were right during the oral arguments to assume what you did
*  assume.
*  That is exactly what they ruled.
*  So tell me about the specifics of this decision.
*  Justice Neil Gorsuch writes for the Sixth Justice majority, and he basically says, you
*  know, it's true.
*  There are some hard questions here.
*  There are some thorny questions.
*  But the question in this particular case, he says, is an easy one.
*  That Laurie Smith has a First Amendment right not to be compelled by the government to make
*  websites for same-sex weddings, even in the face of a Colorado law that prohibits discrimination
*  based on sexual orientation.
*  So basically, they duck the thorny issues and say, she's right.
*  They kind of take her argument at face value.
*  Right. And I guess I'd say they they take her facts at face value because they said
*  that she was basically an artist, that she was engaged in expression.
*  She had earnestly held views about same-sex marriage and that she shouldn't be forced
*  to say something she didn't believe.
*  And in Gorsuch's opinion, is there any limit to what a so-called expressive, creative
*  business can do when it comes to denying services?
*  Like if she, Laurie Smith, wanted to refuse services based on a different kind of belief,
*  say, a belief that interracial marriage is wrong, would denying a couple a wedding website
*  be protected in that case, according to his opinion?
*  So the decision is very closely tied to the facts of the particular case.
*  But the logic of the decision certainly extends to other kinds of discrimination.
*  I was particularly curious about what Justice Gorsuch would have to say about discrimination
*  based on race.
*  And I was surprised enough that I wasn't finding that discussion, that I did a word search
*  in the document to make sure I wasn't missing something.
*  And although the dissent discusses racial discrimination, there's nothing about that
*  in the majority opinion.
*  So the opinion leaves open two kinds of questions, one of them just how far some businesses can
*  go in discriminating against people in various settings.
*  But it also doesn't answer the threshold question of what businesses qualify as expressive businesses
*  in the first place.
*  So Justice Gorsuch seems to studiously avoid drawing lines and distinctions and is deciding
*  the particular case without announcing general legal principles.
*  And the Supreme Court usually is in the business of announcing general legal principles.
*  So as this decision kind of makes its way out into the world, you know, the majority
*  has not defined exactly what an expressive business is.
*  It feels like that's going to be the center of the debate, right, going forward.
*  I mean, this is incredibly squishy.
*  And it seems like this opinion really does everything it can not to wade into that squishiness.
*  That's right.
*  And you can portray that in two ways, one that it's narrowly focused, but the other
*  in not addressing those other scenarios, it may open the door to all kinds of litigation
*  and mischief.
*  And Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent sure makes the point that it's hard to distinguish
*  based on the logic of the decision, other kinds of discrimination.
*  For instance, and she has a lot of examples, but one she offers is, what if a business
*  offers school photos?
*  Can it deny those services to multiracial children because the owner does not want to
*  create any speech indicating that interracial couples are acceptable?
*  I don't think Justice Gorsuch's majority has an answer for that, or at least not one
*  that he has offered.
*  So she's talking about the slippery slope and the negative possible effects from that.
*  Right.
*  She's saying that after the civil rights movement of the 1960s, we have gotten to a place in
*  the United States where everyone has accepted that businesses open to the public can't discriminate.
*  And here, all of a sudden, we're moving in the opposite direction on the basis of a First
*  Amendment doctrine that has not previously been used to allow discrimination.
*  She's basically saying this is discrimination, pure and simple.
*  Yeah, and I'm not sure Lori Smith would say that she's discriminating.
*  She might not adopt that language.
*  But in making distinctions based on her faith and declining to serve people, it is a form
*  of discrimination, but maybe the First Amendment allows it.
*  So Adam, at the end of the day, this really limits the power of anti-discrimination laws,
*  right?
*  How will they govern and be the law of the land in this new environment that we're in
*  after this ruling?
*  I agree with you, Sabrina, that it's a significant step.
*  But let's also recognize the limits.
*  It applies to a relatively narrow class of businesses.
*  It applies to those businesses when they're doing customized expression.
*  And it only comes into play if the business, probably contrary to their economic interests,
*  wants to discriminate against groups of people.
*  And it's true that most anti-discrimination laws will be enforceable tomorrow, just as
*  they were yesterday.
*  But at the same time, the message of the decision seems powerfully symbolic.
*  In a clash between a woman's religious faith and gay rights, religion comes out ahead.
*  Or a cynic might say that this is a decision in the aftermath of the court's ruling establishing
*  a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, which has remained unpopular in some quarters
*  and is a signal in the culture wars that same-sex marriages don't get quite the same
*  protections as other marriages.
*  So even though the ruling was based on free speech, you're saying it's important symbolically
*  that this was specifically about a religious belief in same-sex marriage.
*  Yes.
*  So there are two ways to look at the decision.
*  One is that it's a question about free speech and it applies in all kinds of settings.
*  But I don't know that it gets to the Supreme Court if it didn't involve the contentious
*  issue of same-sex marriage and the feeling among some religious people that it remains
*  a contested and offensive concept.
*  Adam, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  Thank you, Adam.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  I am so disappointed with this decision and it actually almost brings me to tears.
*  On Friday, in a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden's plan
*  to cancel a portion of student loan debt for individual borrowers.
*  We were looking forward to the student loan forgiveness.
*  We were actually expecting that.
*  That's going to crush us financially.
*  As federal student loan debt has risen to more than $1.6 trillion nationwide, the plan
*  specifically targeted lower earners, offering up to $20,000 of debt cancellation for those
*  making less than $125,000 a year.
*  We can't afford housing and groceries.
*  Who do they think are going to pay these back?
*  Because it's not me.
*  The court said the plan, which had not yet gone into effect, overstepped the authority
*  of the Department of Education and required approval of Congress.
*  I know there are millions of Americans, millions of Americans in this country who feel disappointed
*  and discouraged or even a little bit angry about the court's decision today on student
*  debt.
*  And I must admit I do too.
*  Speaking at the White House on Friday, President Biden made his displeasure with the court's
*  decision clear.
*  I believe the court's decision to strike down my student debt relief program was a
*  mistake, was wrong.
*  I'm not going to stop fighting to deliver borrowers what they need, particularly those
*  at the bottom end of the economic scale.
*  He announced he would continue the fight for debt relief and was directing the Secretary
*  of Education to find new ways to ease the economic burden for borrowers.
*  Today's decision has closed one path.
*  Now we're going to pursue another.
*  Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, Rachel Quester, Alex Stern, and Shannon Lin,
*  with help from Michael Simon Johnson.
*  It was edited by Mark George and Paige Cowitt, with help from Devin Taylor, contains original
*  music by Alicia Beaty Tube and Marian Lozano, and was engineered by Chris Wood.
*  Our theme music is by Jim Brunberg and Ben Landsvark of Wonderly.
*  That's it for the Daily.
*  I'm Sabrina Tavernese.
*  See you on Wednesday, after the holiday.
