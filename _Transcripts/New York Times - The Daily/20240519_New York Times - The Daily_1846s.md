# The Sunday Read: ‘Why Did This Guy Put a Song About Me on Spotify?’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBZHU_DCV0w)
*  Hi, I'm Brett Martin.
*  I'm a contributor to the New York Times Magazine and I live in New Orleans.
*  I genuinely don't remember what made me search for my name on Spotify one day last summer.
*  It's possible I was looking for a podcast I'd been on or maybe it was the kind of search
*  that we all do once in a while just to procrastinate or just out of vanity.
*  In any event, I must never have done this particular search before because the first
*  thing I saw was a song titled Brett Martin, You a Nice Man, Yes, and it had been up there
*  for 11 years.
*  Now there are many Brett Martins in this world, several much more famous than I am.
*  He's a Major League Baseball player, an Australian squash legend, some historical figures, but
*  obviously I press play.
*  And at first the words are generic enough.
*  Brett Martin, you're a radio guy, you're a writer man, you're a reporter dude.
*  Granted these are somewhat uncannily like my life, but I'm just thinking this is hysterical.
*  This is my new theme song.
*  Oh Brett Martin, you're a wonderful person, you're a nice man, I really like you.
*  There's a line about you tell good stories and I think this is fabulous, this is even
*  more like me.
*  But then a couple of really specific details stop me in my tracks.
*  Brett Martin, you cry on airplanes, you watch Sweet Home Alabama and you start to cry a lot.
*  Brett Martin, you cry on airplanes, you watch Sweet Home Alabama and you start to cry a lot.
*  Now I worked on a story 20 years ago for This American Life about crying on airplanes and
*  specifically about crying during the movie Sweet Home Alabama.
*  So at this point my girlfriend and our daughters come into the room and I point at the screen
*  and I say, wait a minute, this actually may be a song about me written by some guy I don't
*  even know.
*  And I'm stunned and I am also very, very amused.
*  Needless to say, this song becomes a huge hit in my house.
*  We probably play it 27 times, play it for every guest that comes to the house and every
*  time we laugh uproariously.
*  And it's not until maybe my 30th listen that I actually register how it ends.
*  This guy sings, Brett Martin, I really like you.
*  Will you be my friend?
*  Will you call me on the phone?
*  Brett Martin, here's my phone number.
*  And he sings his actual phone number.
*  Brett Martin, here's my phone number.
*  603-644-
*  I have to admit it takes me a few days to call.
*  First of all, who calls anybody anymore?
*  And who was this guy?
*  But my daughters keep asking if I've called and eventually my curiosity gets the better
*  of me.
*  So I finally pick up the phone and I never could have expected what I'd find on the other
*  end.
*  What happens next is this week's Sunday Read, a piece I wrote for the magazine that's about
*  what it's like to work at the intersection of art and commerce, what it takes to make
*  oneself visible in the never-ending river of content on platforms like Spotify that
*  rule our culture, and how you make a life in a commercial art form.
*  All of which are questions that nearly everybody I know who works in any medium finds themselves
*  asking.
*  So here's my article, read by Eric Jason Martin.
*  Our audio producer today is Adrian Hurst, and the original music you'll hear was written
*  and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  I don't want to make this all about me, but have you heard the song Brett Martin, comma,
*  You a Nice Man, comma, Yes?
*  I guess probably not.
*  On Spotify, Brett Martin, You a Nice Man, Yes, has not yet accumulated enough streams
*  to even register a tally, despite an excessive number of plays in at least one household
*  that I can personally confirm.
*  And I, the titular nice man, didn't hear the one minute, fourteen second song until last
*  summer, a full eleven years after it was uploaded by an artist credited as Papa Rotsy and the
*  Phatags.
*  I like to think this is because of a heroic lack of vanity, though it may just be evidence
*  of very poor search skills.
*  When I did stumble on Brett Martin, You a Nice Man, Yes, I naturally assumed it was
*  about a different, more famous Brett Martin.
*  Perhaps Brett Martin the left-handed reliever who until recently played for the Texas Rangers,
*  or Brett Martin the legendary Australian squash player, or even Clara Brett Martin, the Canadian
*  who in 1897 became the British Empire's first female lawyer.
*  Only when the singer began referencing details of stories that I made for public radios This
*  American Life almost twenty years ago did I realize it actually was about me.
*  The song ended, I really like you, will you be my friend, will you call me on the phone?
*  Then it gave a phone number with a New Hampshire area code.
*  So I called.
*  It's possible that I dialed with outsize expectations.
*  The author of this song, whoever he was, had been waiting eleven long years since his message
*  in a bottle bobbed on the digital seas.
*  Now at long last, here I was.
*  I spent serious time thinking about how to open the conversation, settling on what I
*  imagined was something simple but iconic, on the order of Dr. Livingston, I presume.
*  After one ring, a male voice answered.
*  I said, This is Brett Martin.
*  I'm sorry it's taken me so long to call.
*  The man had no idea who I was.
*  You have to understand, he said apologetically, I've written over 24,000 songs.
*  I wrote 50 songs yesterday.
*  And thus was I ushered into the strange universe of Matt Farley.
*  Farley is 45 and lives with his wife, two sons and a cockapoo named Pippi in Danvers,
*  Massachusetts on the North Shore.
*  For the past 20 years he has been releasing album after album of songs with the object
*  of producing result to match nearly anything anybody could think to search for.
*  These include hundreds of songs name checking celebrities from the very famous to the much
*  less so.
*  He doesn't give out his phone number in all of them, but he does spread it around enough
*  that he gets several calls or texts a week.
*  Perhaps sensing my deflation, he assured me that very few came from the actual subject
*  of a song.
*  He told me the director Dennis Dugan of Dennis Dugan I Like Your Movies Very A Lot, part
*  of an 83 song album about movie directors, called once, but he didn't realize who it
*  was until too late and the conversation was awkward.
*  Freed from the blinding incandescence of my own name, I could suddenly see the extent
*  of what I had stumbled into.
*  It was like the scene in a thriller when the detective first gazes on the wall of a serial
*  killer's lair.
*  Paparazzi and the Fatags is only one of about 80 pseudonyms Farley uses to release his music.
*  As the hungry food band, he sings songs about foods.
*  As the guy who sings songs about cities and towns, he sings the Atlas.
*  He has 600 songs inviting different named girls to the prom and 500 that are marriage
*  proposals.
*  He has an album of very specific apologies.
*  He was devoted to sports teams in every city that has a sports team, hundreds of songs
*  about animals and jobs and weather and furniture, and one band that is simply called the guy
*  who sings your name over and over.
*  He also has many, many songs about going to the bathroom.
*  If you have a child under 10 with access to the internet, it is very likely you know some
*  part of this body of work.
*  What he refers to collectively as his poop songs are mostly released under two names,
*  the Toilet Bowl Cleaners and the odd man who sings about poop, puke and pee.
*  The odd man is more shameless, he explained.
*  The Toilet Bowl Cleaners are making statements with their albums.
*  Though the distinction between the former's butt cheeks, butt cheeks, butt cheeks and
*  the latter's I need a lot of toilet paper to clean the poop in my butt may be subtler
*  than he imagines.
*  Largely, though not entirely, on the strength of such songs, Farley has managed to achieve
*  that most elusive of goals, a decent living creating music.
*  In 2008, his search engine optimization project took in $3,000.
*  Four years later, it had grown to $24,000.
*  The introduction of Alexa and her voice-activated sister-in opened up the there-to-for underserved
*  non-typing market.
*  In particular, the kind fond of shouting things like, poop in my fingernails, at the computer.
*  Poop in my fingernails, by the Toilet Bowl Cleaners, currently has over 4.4 million streams
*  on Spotify alone.
*  To date, that band and the odd man who sings about poop, puke and pee have collectively
*  brought in approximately $469,000 from various platforms.
*  They are by far Farley's biggest earners, but not the only ones.
*  Paparazzi and the Fatags has earned $41,000.
*  The Best Birthday Song Band Ever, $38,000.
*  The Guy Who Sings Your Name Over and Over, $80,000.
*  Dozens of others have taken in two, three or four digits.
*  The New Orleans Sports Band, the Chicago Sports Band, the Singing Film Critic, the Great Weather
*  Song Person, the Paranormal Song Warrior, the Moturn Media Holiday Singers, who perform
*  70 versions of We Wish You A Merry Christmas, substituting contemporary foods for Figgy
*  Pudding.
*  It adds up.
*  Farley quit his day job in 2017.
*  "'People like to criticize the whole streaming thing, but there's really a lot of pros to
*  it,' he said.
*  In 2023, his music earned him just shy of $200,000, about one half penny at a time.
*  Farley's earnings help fund his multiple other creative endeavors.
*  He records what he calls his No Jokes music.
*  This includes a two-man band he's been in since college called Mo's Haven, which once
*  recorded an album a day for a year.
*  He hosts two podcasts, one about his work and the other recapping Celtics games.
*  And he makes movies, micro-budgeted, determinately amateur but nevertheless recognizably cinematic
*  features starring himself and his family and friends.
*  They feature a spectacular array of New England accents.
*  In most, Farley plays some version of himself, a mild-mannered, eccentric hero projecting
*  varying degrees of menace.
*  Farley and his college friend Charlie Roxberg are in the midst of a project in which they
*  have resolved to release two full movies per year.
*  The model, Farley said, was inspired by Hallmark movies.
*  "'If this movie stinks, good news.
*  We're making another in six months.'"
*  Their most popular work remains Don't Let the River Beast Get You, 2012, a charmingly
*  shaggy tale of a cryptid threatening a small New England town.
*  It features Farley's father as a big game hunter named Ido Hutkins.
*  Like many of Farley's endeavors, his films have attracted a small but intense following.
*  "'I could fill a 5,000-seat arena if I could only get everybody in one place,' he says.
*  His is the kind of obsessive project that seems to inspire the same from others."
*  A few years ago, Lior Galil, a Chicago music writer, set out to listen to Farley's entire
*  corpus from start to finish, chronicling the journey in a zine titled Freaky for Farley.
*  Four pages into issue one, he had already taken on the grim tone of an Arctic explorer.
*  "'I've become a little tired of the album, 25 songs in,' he wrote,
*  which makes me concerned about my ability to get through the rest of this listening quest.
*  Issue two begins, I failed.'"
*  The umbrella name that Farley uses for all his outputs is
*  Moturn. He made the word up, or rather, he seized on what he felt was its strange power
*  after misspelling the word intern in what he had planned to be a 10,000-page novel.
*  To Farley, creativity has always been a volume business. That, in fact, is the gist of The
*  Moturn Method, a 136-page manifesto on creativity that he self-published in 2021.
*  His theory is that every idea, no matter its apparent value, must be honored and completed.
*  An idea thwarted is an insult to the muse and is punished accordingly.
*  "'If you reject your own ideas, then the part of the brain that comes up with ideas
*  is going to stop,' he said. You just do it and do it and do it and you sort it out later."
*  Or, as the case may be, you don't, but rather send it all out into the abyss,
*  hoping that someday, somebody, somewhere, will hear it.
*  I was aware, of course, that on some level I'd been had, the one tiny fish,
*  vain enough to be snared in Farley's trawl. It left me a bit paranoid. Charlie Roxberg
*  suddenly seemed like such a perfect Boston pseudonym that I spent a day investigating
*  whether he was a real person. He's real, lives in Connecticut, and makes corporate videos for
*  his day job. I lost another day chasing after a letterboxed commenter who goes by the handle
*  DCS577 and was so baffled by the popularity of Farley's movies that he published his own
*  short e-book, The Not Moturn Method. It urges readers to give up on their artistic dreams
*  and even mimics Farley's buckshot SEO by appearing in multiple, slightly different versions.
*  Surely he had to be a Farley alter ego. Nope, a 36-year-old movie buff in Missouri.
*  Mostly, I was trying to figure out whether I thought Farley was a bad guy. Did his scheme
*  represent the inevitable cynical end product of a culture in the grips of algorithmic platforms?
*  Or might it be a delightful side effect? Was his work spam or a kind of outsider art?
*  Was he just the poop song guy or was he closer to Steve Keene, the Brooklyn-based,
*  GenX hipster-approved painter of over 300,000 works who has been the subject of books and
*  museum retrospectives? As it happens, Farley has a song about Steve Keene. It's on a paparazzi album
*  titled I Am Not Wasting My Life, which suggested he was asking some of the same questions.
*  When I went to Danvers to meet Farley in December, it became quickly apparent that he is the most
*  transparent person in the world. He's got a thick head of hair, high cheekbones, and a friendly
*  Kyle Chandler-like face that none other letterboxed reviewer correctly identified as
*  Youth Pastory. When he picked me up at my hotel, he was wearing a fleece-lined brown hoodie that,
*  judging by social media, is the only outer layer he wears throughout the New England winter,
*  including on the 15-20 mile walks he takes twice a week. He struck me as the kind of guy who wears
*  shorts the moment it gets above 48 degrees. Compulsively early, he confessed that he arrived
*  at the lobby an hour before we were scheduled to meet. You might mistake Moturn's aesthetic for
*  stoner humor, but Farley says he has never had a sip of alcohol, much less done drugs.
*  By his own description, he eats like a picky 12-year-old. When I made him take me to a
*  restaurant in Salem called Doob's Seafood, famed for its belly clams, he ordered chicken nuggets
*  and buried them beneath a blizzard of salt and ground pepper, removing the top of the pepper
*  shaker to pour it on more directly. In the car, we listened to the rolling stones, the replacements,
*  Tom Waits. It's a mammoth accomplishment of self-control for me not to be playing my own
*  music right now, he said, though his efforts at restraint were puzzling, given that I was,
*  in all likelihood, the one person on earth at that moment whose job was to listen to it.
*  All of Farley's life, he has wanted to make things and have people see and hear them.
*  After going to school at Providence College, he moved to Manchester, New Hampshire,
*  specifically because he knew nobody there who might distract him.
*  If you know people, they want you to go to cookouts, he says. I designed my entire life to
*  not have to go to cookouts. Even now, he cannot abide downtime. To him, the wasted time of a party
*  or watching a football game is measured in songs or scripts he could have written.
*  At no point did Farley consider a more conventional route, such as film school or a low-level job in
*  the entertainment industry. Instead, he took a job at a group home for teenagers, knocking out a
*  40-hour week in three days so that he could work on music and movies the other four. He would leave
*  Mose Haven CDs in public places across Manchester, hoping somebody would pick them up. He slipped
*  them into the stacks at local record stores, like a reverse shoplifter. He would drive people to the
*  airport just so he could force his music on them on the way. Farley's persona is simultaneously
*  grandiose. I really do think I'm the greatest songwriter of the 21st century, he told me,
*  and knowingly self-effacing. One night, I went with him to a tiny independent theater in Lexington
*  for a screening of the moturn film Magic Spot, a time travel comedy. On the drive down, I asked what
*  the end game for the movies was. Obviously, they have a very different business model from his music.
*  What if somebody gave him, say, a million dollars to make his next movie? He thought for a second.
*  Three hundred thousand for me and Charlie, spread the rest around to the people who have helped us
*  all these years, make a ten thousand dollar movie, and get sued, he said. That would be about twice
*  the budget of a typical moturn joint. Magic Spot wasn't on the marquee when we pulled up,
*  but there was a flyer taped to the door. We couldn't afford color copies, but we did our best,
*  the theater owner said as he let us in. There were eleven people in the audience,
*  including Farley's father and brother-in-law, both of whom were in the movie. There was also
*  a film student named Taylor who had driven up from the Cape for the second of three moturn screenings
*  he'd see within a month, and two guys down from Manchester, one of whom was turning the other
*  on to the Farley cannon. A few minutes into the movie, the sound went out, and we sat for about
*  ten minutes while Farley frantically tried to fix it. He was on the verge of jury-rigging a solution
*  involving holding a microphone to his laptop when the sound system miraculously healed itself.
*  A huge success. I'm on cloud nine, he said, as we headed back toward Danvers. After the show,
*  he refused to accept his share of the ticket sales, instead pressing extra money into the
*  owner's hands as thanks. For somebody so driven to find an audience and so immune to embarrassment,
*  the advent of the digital age was a miracle. Farley began uploading the Moe's Haven catalog
*  to iTunes when it came out, and then to Spotify. As described in the closely autobiographical
*  moturn film Local Legends, Moe's Haven was intended to meld the sounds of Bob Dylan,
*  Van Morrison, and Pink Floyd into a musical concoction that was going to blow the minds
*  of millions of fans all the way around the world. As it turned out, Farley noticed that the only song
*  that seemed to blow minds, or at least get downloaded, was a comic throwaway called
*  Shut Up Your Monkey. Get down, get funky, shut up your monkey.
*  Some people would have quit right there, he says. I saw an opportunity.
*  A lot of energy has been spent trying to pick the lock of the recommendation algorithms that can make
*  or break a song on Spotify and other streaming services. Any number of online courses, distributors,
*  and publishing companies promise to navigate the labyrinth of inputs, playlist inclusion,
*  natural language processing, average length of listens, influencer attention, metrics like
*  acousticness, speechiness, and danceability that will push a song onto millions of users'
*  recommended playlists. Critics, meanwhile, bemoan the rise of bands like Greta Van Fleet, an
*  algorithmic fever dream, according to Pitchfork, who seemed to be engineered to be the next song
*  after whatever it was you actually chose to listen to. When I asked Farley how much of this he
*  factors into his work, the answer was almost zero. He gets the sense that longer titles
*  seem to work better than short ones, and that around a minute and a half is a good minimum
*  length, but for the most part, his is a blunt force attack on the softer target of search results.
*  At its most intentionally parasitic, this includes such tracks as a review of Exile on Main Street,
*  designed to be discovered by the Rolling Stones' Curious. A 2013 album credited to the passionate
*  and objective Joker fan takes advantage of the fact that song titles cannot be copyrighted.
*  Thus, This Girl is on Fire, Quick, Grab a Fire Extinguisher, Almost, Instant Karma, and
*  Searching for Sugar Man, which unlike the more famous Sugar Man by Rodriguez, is about a baker
*  whose sugar delivery is running late. Farley says he has since sworn off these kinds of tricks.
*  These days, he sets himself a relatively light goal of one 50-song album a month, recorded in
*  a spare bedroom in his house. Fifty tracks is the limit that CB Baby, which Farley uses to distribute
*  and manage his music, allows, a regulation that may or may not have something to do with Farley,
*  who used to put as many as 100 on an album. Once he reaches his quota, he begins the tedious work
*  of checking the levels of each song, entering titles and metadata, genre, writer, length,
*  etc., creating an album title and cover art, nearly always a selfie, and uploading the package
*  one song at a time. Farley showed me a worn green spiral notebook in which he meticulously tracks
*  his output and earnings. From Spotify, he earns roughly a third of a cent per stream. Amazon and
*  Apple pay slightly more on average, between a third and three-quarters of a cent. TikTok,
*  on the other hand, pays musicians by the number of videos featuring their songs and is thus immune to
*  Farley's strategy. When Chris and Kylie Jenner recorded a video of themselves dancing to Farley's
*  song about Chris, millions of people saw it, but Farley earned less than one cent.
*  Among other topics Farley told me he planned to tackle in future albums were colleges,
*  household items, tools, musical instruments. I had planned to ask what categories haven't worked,
*  but what had become clear by then is that the idea of any one song or even album hitting the jackpot
*  isn't the point. Even after Spotify's recent announcement that it would no longer pay royalties
*  on songs receiving fewer than a thousand streams, Farley's business model rests on the sheer bulk
*  of his output. And so does his artistic model. Whatever the dubious value of any individual song
*  in the Farley universe, it says part of the enormous body of the whole, the magnum opus,
*  that it gains power. This is especially true when you consider that an artificial intelligence
*  could conceivably produce 24,000 songs, Farley's entire oeuvre, in about a day.
*  A fact that gives his defiantly human, even artisanal, labour a kind of lonely Sisyphean
*  dignity. Whatever else Farley's work is, it is not AI, even when it barely seems to be AI.
*  A year or two ago, Farley discovered with some chagrin that he was no longer the number one
*  result for the search Poopsong. There was another Poopsong guy. His name is Teddy Casey,
*  and amazingly, he is also from a Boston suburb, Newton. That's where the similarities with Farley
*  stop. Casey has precisely two songs available for streaming, a sweet kids song about animals
*  called Monkey, and the Poopsong, which has over four million streams across various platforms.
*  Casey is 55. Until recently, he was working as a bartender and hosting open mic nights
*  near where he lives in mid-coast Maine. When I reached him, he was back home after a week
*  in New Hampshire, training to become a U.S. Postal Service letter carrier. He wrote his Poopsong
*  around 2009, but he didn't get around to posting it until 2020. It didn't do anything for months,
*  he said, and then all of a sudden, one month, it made $20. I was like, wow, cool, buy a case of beer.
*  These days, the song brings in about $1200 per month, enough to pay his rent, Casey told me,
*  with what sounded like a Lebowski and shrug. I have other songs that I want to put up,
*  he said, but I kind of don't want to sell out. I asked if he knew about the toilet bowl cleaners,
*  and he said he'd heard a few of their songs. I'm not making this up, he said. There's this other
*  guy, I don't know if you've heard of him, the odd man who sings about poop, puke, and pee.
*  His idea was to customize every Poopsong, so there's a Steven Poopsong, a Bob Poopsong,
*  a Mary Poopsong, he's got hundreds. I told him that both bands were in fact the same person.
*  Well, okay, he said, as if realizing the full extent of what he was up against.
*  I like mine better, but I'm biased, he said finally. You can tell he knows how to write songs,
*  but I think he's just been going for volume. In fact, I knew about the suite of songs that
*  combine Farley's two most successful genres, names and poop, because he was working on a new
*  set of them when I visited him. He estimated that he had already completed about three thousand,
*  but there were always new names. This can be kind of painful, he warned,
*  switching on his keyboard and firing up his laptop. He donned headphones,
*  consulted a list of names and got to work. In the silence of the room, I could just hear the
*  soft click of the keyboard and his vocals. Jamila, P-P-P-Poop, Jamila, Poop, Poop, Poop.
*  In Local Heroes, which is something like Farley's All That Jazz, there's a fantasy
*  sequence in which Farley imagines the two sides of his personality arguing,
*  one the serious, heartfelt artist, the other a greasy record executive demanding ever more poop
*  songs. Of course, the scene can only be a fantasy and can only have Farley playing both characters,
*  because the greasy record executive belongs to a lost world, one in which drastically fewer people
*  had a chance to produce art and the work was often corrupted by corporate gatekeepers,
*  but in which there was also a clearly marked road to an audience and a living. Farley represents
*  both the best and worst of the incentives and opportunities that have taken this world's place.
*  Certainly, there are few creators working today in any medium who would not recognize the anxiety
*  he embodies, that their work now lives or dies by the vagaries of opaque algorithms serving a
*  bottomless menu of options to an increasingly distracted public, and that if they don't bow
*  to the demands of these new realities, their work, and by extension they, will simply disappear.
*  Which is to say that while the experience of watching Farley work was not un-painful,
*  as promised, neither was it totally unfamiliar.
*  After a minute and a half of the Jamila poop song, Farley paused. He adjusted a few dials,
*  consulted his notebook, thought for a few seconds, and plowed on to the next song.
*  Different tempo, different vocals, similar theme. Tanka Tanka he sang. Poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.
