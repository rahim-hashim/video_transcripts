# Secure the Border, Say Republicans. So Why Are They Killing a Plan to Do That?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yk0RN-MCiE)
*  From New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. This is The Daily.
*  For the past few weeks, Democrats and Republicans were closing in on a game-changing deal to
*  secure the U.S.-Mexico border, the kind of bipartisan compromise that's unheard of in
*  contemporary Washington. Today, Karan Demersia on why that deal is falling apart.
*  It's Thursday, February 1st. So, Karan, we're here to perform a kind of autopsy on a deal that might
*  have been. To talk about a major bipartisan immigration agreement that took form over the
*  past few weeks. It was championed by President Biden, leaders from both parties in the Senate,
*  to understand exactly why in a divided, dysfunctional Washington it ever seemed like it had a chance to
*  become law and why in the end it seems to have been derailed. So where does that story start?
*  So the genesis of all of this is really late last summer when it starts to look like military
*  assistance for Ukraine, which the United States had been funding and giving to this ally since
*  early 2022 to help them fight off a Russian invasion is about to dry up. It had never been
*  completely easy, but it had never been a really serious challenge to get this sort of money
*  through Congress in various tranches in the past year and a half. But all of a sudden,
*  the right wing of the Republican Party starts to get really, really stubborn about saying,
*  we're not going to let you have this money unless you give us something that's important to us in
*  terms of national security. And that is more border enforcement on the southern border with
*  Mexico. So Republicans in Congress say to the president, you want that funding to Ukraine to
*  be consistent the way it has been. You're going to have to give us greater security on the US
*  Mexico border. Exactly. It's a completely unorthodox sort of a linkage. The logic that has been
*  presented is that they're both kind of national security type issues. But the idea of linking
*  the Ukraine war to border security, it's fairly novel. And it's born out of the political
*  priorities of the people who are pushing for that. The same group of Republicans that starts this
*  push for more border security measures, more enforcement, they also just so happen to be the
*  people who never liked the idea of sending all of this aid to Ukraine in the first place. Got it.
*  And it only takes a couple of weeks before this talking point that originated in the right wing
*  of the Republican Party. I am not inclined to support any more you help to Ukraine at this time.
*  If we want to take care of an invasion, we've got an invasion on that southern border. Kind of takes
*  over the entire mainstream of the party. I'm for better security at our border. I'm also for
*  supporting Ukraine. I feel like we've got to negotiate these in tandem. And you have many
*  prominent Republicans in the Senate too. Are you saying Ukraine should not be a standalone? It will
*  not be a standalone. Saying we're not going to let Ukraine aid get renewed unless there's border
*  security alongside of it. And things actually do hit a deadline at the end of September,
*  where this emergency aid that's been flowing for Ukraine since the beginning of the war,
*  they don't actually reauthorize it on time. And so all of a sudden, there's this pause and
*  everybody in the Democratic Party starts to panic. You're saying Republicans put their money where
*  their mouth is and they say, this is not just a talking point. You're not going to get this
*  aid for Ukraine at all. We are serious. Yeah. And after this, it becomes very clear that
*  Ukraine funding is not going to go ahead unless there are some border security measures attached
*  to it. That leaves President Biden in a little bit of a bind because he has staked a lot of his
*  legacy reputation on this Ukraine war. And it is the biggest success of his foreign policy. And so
*  he takes this very unorthodox, very surprising step of basically saying, okay, I'll meet that
*  demand. I will tie these two things together. And I cannot overstate how much of an earthquake
*  it is that Biden actually took that step to say, I will accept the GOP's ultimatum as legitimate
*  and actually come and try to meet it. Well, just explain that. Why is that such an earthquake,
*  given that you just described this as a kind of impossible bind for Biden? Well,
*  it flies in the face of basically three or four decades worth of what Democrats approach has been
*  to border security, which is that it's part of a bigger conversation about immigration policy
*  that has to involve things like pathways to citizenship or putting more visas for family
*  reunification on the table, or something that isn't primarily policing, processing, and shutting
*  things down. And that's been the case going back to basically the Reagan years, since that's the
*  last time Congress actually managed to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill. To split
*  off border security and say, oh, we'll do it alone and we won't ask for anything really on
*  the immigration front, that is breaking with a whole lot of precedent that frankly, a lot of the
*  Democratic Party saw as President Biden selling out on something that was pretty fundamental to
*  how they approach this issue. You're saying this is revolutionary because it violates a longstanding
*  Democratic approach that they will negotiate around reducing migrant crossings at the border,
*  they will strengthen border security, if and only if their approach to immigration is kind of met
*  halfway by Republicans. And in this instance, Biden is instead agreeing to negotiate a tougher
*  approach to the border without such halfway meeting from the other side. Instead, he's just doing it
*  to get money for Ukraine.
*  Exactly. And that is why several Democrats see this as him basically selling out immigrants and
*  giving up all the leverage that they might have on border security to get money for the next nine
*  months for Ukraine. However, President Biden and the Democrats who support him see this as a
*  potential opportunity. Yes, Ukraine is a problem, a big problem. But so is the border. They are seeing
*  the surge of migrants come to the border. They are seeing how many are being bused internally into the
*  country. They are seeing how tens of thousands are flooding the streets of democratically run cities
*  like New York. Right. And they know that that's a huge political liability for President Biden if he
*  doesn't do something to address it before the November elections. And so tying these two things
*  together basically gives him a potential opportunity to address two big issues with one
*  stone, if it works.
*  So once Biden takes this very unorthodox approach to funding border security in order to get this money
*  for Ukraine, what ends up happening?
*  So this creates an opportunity for a potentially huge deal on the border. A long shot, the type of
*  deal that has eluded Congress for several decades at this point. And a core group of three senators
*  starts entering this very intense phase of negotiations. They meet on a near daily basis for
*  months. And eventually they actually do coalesce around a set of policies that they think could work
*  to actually clamp down on the migration problem at the border in a way that both parties could stomach.
*  And what do they end up agreeing on?
*  They agree that they need to make it harder for people to claim asylum. There's a lot of people making
*  frivolous asylum claims who don't actually fear persecution if they go home. So they agree to raise
*  that bar. They agree to expand the capacity of detention facilities because a lot of the
*  Republicans' complaints are that you're letting all these migrants just run off into the country with
*  no guarantee that you can bring them back to deport them later. They should be in detention centers.
*  So they agree to do that. And kind of most critically, they agree to basically limit the number of
*  people that can come into the country on any given day. And the way they envision doing that is if the
*  number of migrants that border patrol officers encounter reaches an average of 5,000 per day, it
*  would trigger an effective shutdown of the border.
*  Huh.
*  That might sound like a lot, 5,000. It's actually far fewer than what we see now. Late last year, there
*  was an average of about 8,000 people trying to cross in every day. So this trigger functions as a fail
*  safe, that if all these other measures they're putting out there can't bring down the number of migrants
*  coming to the border, at least there's this that would actually shut things down.
*  So taken together, this seems like a pretty restrictive set of policies at the border, and a lot
*  like a Republican approach. And you're saying this is what a bipartisan group of senators comes
*  around to. So on top of starting off where Republicans wanted Biden to start off in these negotiations,
*  Biden and Democrats seem to be willing to sign off on a bill that is very much out of line with
*  traditional Democratic approaches to the border and immigration.
*  Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to speak to you today about an urgent responsibility the Congress
*  has to uphold the national security needs in the United States.
*  They definitely are.
*  We need real solutions. I support real solutions at the border.
*  President Biden comes out and says, we need this deal, get this done.
*  In terms of changes of policy and to provide resources that we need at the border, I'm really
*  there to change policy as well.
*  And that he's willing to make very serious, pretty major concessions in the Senate.
*  We see Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer put pressure on the Senate.
*  If we believe something is important and urgent, we should stay and get the job done.
*  Schumer even goes so far as to try to hold the Senate in until the holidays in the hopes they
*  can speed together the end of a deal.
*  Members need to be here next week.
*  We have to get this done.
*  And it's not just the Democrats.
*  Republican leaders are saying to themselves, this is an opportunity that's never going to be
*  repeated where you have Democrats this willing to make this kind of a deal.
*  We should take it and run with it and try to make this work.
*  And so as you're nearing the end of 2023, getting into the beginning of 2024, it actually seems
*  like it's a possibility that there could be the votes for this deal if they can just finalize it
*  in the Senate.
*  But it's a very different story in the Republican-led House, which has been much more
*  skeptical of a deal.
*  And it's a very different story as former President Trump, who's still really the leader of
*  the Republican Party, starts to rack up primary wins in Iowa and New Hampshire and starts
*  weighing in on this deal in very unsavory terms.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Karin, tell us exactly how, at this moment of maximum possibility, that this bipartisan
*  immigration deal starts to unravel.
*  As we get into the new year, the opposition from the House starts to get much more solidified.
*  You'd had a situation where basically, Mike Johnson, he's a new speaker, he starts in his
*  office at the end of October, just as all this stuff about the border negotiations and the
*  Ukraine deal is just picking up in the Senate.
*  And for a while, he's sounding like he might be open to it.
*  But by the time you get to the beginning of the new year...
*  Yeah, we have a humanitarian catastrophe here, and of course, huge national security concerns.
*  He is actually down on the border.
*  If you don't end catch and release as a policy, if you don't reinstitute remain in Mexico,
*  if you only fix asylum or parole and not these other things, then you don't have the right
*  to do that.
*  Saying that he doesn't think that this has legs, that it does not go far enough to secure
*  the border.
*  We're just asking the White House to apply common sense, and they seem to be completely
*  uninterested in doing so.
*  And that's the point at which it becomes clear that he has fully surrobed on the deal.
*  And how much do you, covering this, take that motivation at face value?
*  What's really going on?
*  I mean, if the Democrats have come this far and they've been in the White House for a
*  long time, the Democrats have come this far and Senate Republicans are pleased and pushing
*  for a deal, what's really keeping the House speaker from seeing this as an opportunity
*  as well?
*  Well, the House speaker does come from the right wing of the GOP.
*  He is inclined to say, look, we need a lot of really draconian restrictions on the border
*  to make sure that it's actually enforced.
*  But there's another element at play here, too.
*  The so-called border security deal Biden is gushing out and pushing out is not designed
*  to stop illegal immigration.
*  It's designed to continue.
*  Trump, who, as we said by mid-January, has reclaimed the mantle of the GOP from winning
*  these primary contests.
*  Trump is the leader of our party.
*  There is zero chance I will support this horrible open borders betrayal of America.
*  And he is openly using that pulpit to trash this emerging deal and tell Republicans to
*  vote against it.
*  I'd rather have no bill than a bad bill, a bad bill you can't have.
*  And that's what was happening in the House.
*  And why?
*  I mean, what is his reasoning for trashing a deal that starts to fulfill something so
*  central to his identity as president, which is get tough on the border?
*  Part of it is that the deal doesn't go as far as he would like to see it go.
*  It doesn't restore all of the policies like remain in Mexico and border wall construction
*  that he had pursued during his presidency.
*  But part of it is also that he doesn't want to give Biden a win on this.
*  It's an extremely compelling political campaign issue for him with his base.
*  And if the Senate makes a bipartisan deal and a bunch of Republicans are endorsing that
*  bipartisan deal, it becomes harder for him to say Democrats don't want to secure the
*  border, reelect me.
*  So in a very real sense, Trump is trying to torpedo this, we suspect, because he wants
*  to make sure that a huge issue so animating and central to his campaign and his base remains
*  an issue that's animating to his campaign and to his base.
*  If he lets this deal happen, he can no longer run against a Joe Biden who hasn't done
*  something about the border.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  And he and his supporters are very committed to keeping that tool alive for the next several
*  months.
*  But help me understand the power of what Trump is up to here, because at this moment, yes,
*  he's Donald Trump, a very influential leader within the Republican Party, but he's not
*  involved in the negotiations.
*  He's president, he might not win and become president.
*  So just how meaningful is his message to these House Republicans?
*  It's extremely meaningful because it's not like Donald Trump is on an island thinking
*  this way.
*  By weighing in here, he's exploiting a divide that was always there in the GOP.
*  You had the right wing of the party, very, very skeptical because they want to do more.
*  And then you had a part of the party that was saying, hey, let's make a deal.
*  So Trump coming in and catering to the base on this is kind of exactly what Trump always
*  does.
*  And once he does exploit that gap, it not only reinforces the anti-deal sentiment that
*  was already there in the House, it starts to turn senators cold on the idea of a deal
*  too.
*  And it trickles all the way up to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who tells a room
*  full of Republicans, as the deal is getting very, very close to being done, look, we're
*  in a quandary here.
*  We are potentially voting against the person who's going to be the GOP nominee.
*  And so we have to decide, are we going to vote with what Trump wants or against it?
*  And judging by the fact that McConnell said this to a room full of Republican senators,
*  I suspect he is in doing so revealing the answer, right?
*  That you really can't vote against the party's nominee.
*  Yeah.
*  He is admitting to the reality that they're in, which is that you can't do this without
*  there being heck to pay on the campaign trail.
*  And that could blow back on a lot of his members if they decide, no, we're going to put our
*  heads down and plow through with this.
*  And it's around this point where McConnell shows he's wavering, he's willing to be swayed
*  and not lead his party through this, that Johnson jumps back in and says, this is dead
*  on arrival if it comes to the House.
*  Which in a way creates even more pressure on Senate Republicans who start saying, look,
*  if this doesn't have a future, why should we stick our necks out for this deal?
*  So is it correct to say that that is the moment when this almost major bipartisan deal basically
*  collapses?
*  I think the next few days are going to tell whether Trump has successfully torpedoed it
*  or whether there's going to be a schism in the GOP because some senators decide not to
*  let him completely torpedo it.
*  But yeah, ultimately speaking, the fate of this bill is slim to none in Congress because
*  Trump has reinforced the House's inclinations and that has created back pressure on Senate
*  Republicans to just say, nah, not now, not good enough, not this year.
*  What is the reaction from President Biden to this turn of events and to the kind of
*  rapid deterioration of this deal?
*  So President Biden does something kind of interesting.
*  Two months ago, my team beginning to work with a bipartisan group of senators to put
*  together the toughest, smartest, fairest border security bill in history.
*  He starts talking really tough about the border and saying, that bill with the law today,
*  I'm going to shut down the border right now and fix it quickly.
*  Give me this deal.
*  If you give it to me, I will shut down the border.
*  It is the sort of talk that you'd expect to hear, frankly, from a big border enforcement
*  guy, which is not how President Biden started off his term.
*  He's the guy who campaigned on a humane approach to immigration.
*  And now he's saying, I'll shut it all down.
*  And so in a way, it's like he's trying to enter the ring that Trump is already in and
*  basically out flex him on how tough he can talk about the border.
*  So at this point, what happens to the two very substantive questions at the center of
*  this bill and this compromise?
*  What happens to funding for Ukraine and what happens to this effort to secure the border
*  if this bill now seems to be going absolutely nowhere?
*  That is the big question, right?
*  Because when this all started, Republicans set this quid pro quo of no Ukraine aid without
*  the border deal.
*  If they don't accept the border deal that the bipartisan team of negotiators came up
*  with, either they've got to renege on that position that got this ball rolling in the
*  first place to make sure that more Ukraine aid can get out the door, or they've just
*  got to say, yeah, we're comfortable with that.
*  We're comfortable with the fact that the United States is going to pull back on support that
*  maybe the rest of the Western world will follow and that that means Russia could overwhelm
*  Ukraine on the battlefield.
*  For Democrats, there's very little incentive to give the Republicans any of these border
*  enforcement measures without securing that Ukraine aid.
*  That was the whole reason that they agreed to go into this negotiation in the first place.
*  And the result of that is basically going to be, you know, maintenance of the status
*  quo, which is a little bit bleak given the fact that leaders of both parties have acknowledged
*  the situation, the border is not tenable and something has to be done about it.
*  It feels like at the end of the day, this is really the story of a Democratic president
*  being willing to meet his Republican congressional peers much more than halfway on a very sensitive
*  issue, the border and immigration.
*  And the response from those congressional Republican peers is to reject the offer, not,
*  it seems fundamentally because of the policies at hand, but because of the politics at hand,
*  because Donald Trump told them he doesn't like the deal.
*  And they said, well, if you don't like it, we don't like it.
*  So what does that ultimately tell us?
*  I think it tells us that what Republicans want here is either entirely Republican solution
*  that looks like a resumption of the policies that President Trump implemented on the border,
*  which is a big ask when you only control the House of Representatives and Democrats control the Senate
*  and the White House, or they want to be able to preserve the ability to blame the Biden administration.
*  We've talked about how that's likely to play out and already is playing out on the presidential
*  presidential election circuit.
*  It's also playing out within the House of Representatives, which is currently trying to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas,
*  the Homeland Security secretary, effectively for failing to shut down the border in what, frankly,
*  a lot of conservative legal scholars are also calling not a good impeachment, something that does not actually
*  rise to the level of that sort of indictment and punitive action.
*  But that's what they're choosing to do.
*  And that is very much a sticking your finger, pointing it at the Biden administration and saying,
*  this is your fault and we want you guys to take the personal hit for this.
*  And we want to prioritize that over any sort of down payment on trying to make these policy fixes
*  that maybe we could build on if we had a Republican president next.
*  And that seems to be the prevailing winds in the GOP.
*  And that wind is no deals, even if the deal is on something that the Republicans say they care about and want,
*  because they would rather be able to blame the Democrats.
*  Yeah.
*  Unless they get everything that they want or practically everything that they want,
*  maintaining that ability to say it's your fault is worth more.
*  And that's just a reality of the political time that we're in.
*  But it's also just a reality of how messily divided things are in Congress
*  and how impossibly hard it can be to chart a middle way.
*  Well, Karin, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
*  Thank you so much.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to another day.
*  Online child sexual exploitation is a crisis in America.
*  During a high profile hearing on Wednesday,
*  senators from both parties interrogated the country's most powerful tech executives
*  about what they think is the best way to deal with the problem.
*  The
*  Instagram displayed the following warning screen to individuals who were searching for child abuse material.
*  These results may contain images of child sexual abuse.
*  And then you gave users two choices.
*  One, you can't use the child abuse material.
*  The leaders of meta, TikTok, Snap, Discord and X testified that they have taken steps to crack down on the
*  child abuse material.
*  And then you gave users two choices.
*  Get resources or see results anyway.
*  Mr. Zuckerberg, what the hell were you thinking?
*  All right, Senator.
*  The basic science behind the leaders of meta, TikTok, Snap, Discord and X testified that they have taken steps
*  to crack down on such material.
*  But when pressed, most of the executives refused to endorse federal regulation to address the problem.
*  Are you familiar with the Earn It Act?
*  Do you support that?
*  Like, yes or no?
*  We're not prepared to support it today, but we believe that section support the CSAM Act.
*  The Stop CSAM Act.
*  We are not prepared to support it.
*  Would you support the shield that we believe that the cyber tip line and neck that would be no.
*  Throughout the hearing, families in the audience held up photos of the victims of online child sexual abuse,
*  an act that Republican Senator Lindsey Graham singled out for praise.
*  To all the victims who came and showed us photos of your loved ones, don't quit.
*  It's working.
*  You're making a difference.
*  Through you, we'll get to where we need to go so other people won't have to show a photo of their family.
