# What Lahaina Lost in Hawaiiâ€™s Wildfires
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BII0bK4uEUo)
*  Anela, for someone who's never been to Lahaina town, can you paint a picture of the town
*  for me?
*  I mean, if I were to walk down Front Street, say, what would I see?
*  You could probably see the man on his bike with his parrot on his shoulder just riding
*  along.
*  You would probably see an elder sitting on the side and just saying hello to everybody,
*  making time to talk story if you wanted to talk story.
*  You'll see people sitting under the tree, what we call Campbell Park, by the Pioneer
*  Inn, which is a nice shady area.
*  It's not too far from the Banyan Tree.
*  Or if you're under the Banyan Tree, you'll see people sitting on the benches either having
*  lunch or just taking pictures or just relaxing.
*  You'll see people walking down having ice cream from David Lapert's on the corner.
*  You'll see people going into the ABC store, buying t-shirts and little memorabilia or
*  souvenirs.
*  You'll see people along the wall, what we call the wall, where there was no shop.
*  It was just a wall walkway.
*  Standing there, looking at the water, the ebb tide going in and out, taking pictures,
*  looking at all the sailboats and just enjoying the ambience of Front Street.
*  Walk down further, you see more restaurants, there's art galleries, there's the famous
*  Ululani shaved ice that people just draw to the line was always long because on a hot
*  day having the shaved ice was such a treat to cool you off.
*  And just walking down and going into the stores and just seeing all the people there and walking
*  by and just a sense of peace, really.
*  Yeah, it's all gone.
*  It's all gone.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  Last week, wildfires broke out on the Hawaiian island of Maui.
*  They burned so uncontrollably and so quickly that some people had to swim into the sea
*  to survive.
*  As the weekend came to a close, the devastation came into focus.
*  More than 1,000 people are missing and 93 people are dead, making it the deadliest fire
*  in the United States in over a century.
*  One of the hardest hit places was the town of Lahaina on the island's northwestern edge.
*  Lahaina was once the royal capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii.
*  The fire decimated its historic center and at its heart, Waiole Church, the oldest on
*  the island and a cherished meeting place for Hawaiians.
*  Today, the minister of that church, Anela Rosa, talks about what it means to lose Lahaina
*  and what it will take to rebuild it.
*  It's Monday, August 14th.
*  Anela, may I call you Anela?
*  Yes, of course.
*  Hi honey.
*  Oh, it's lovely to meet you.
*  Thank you.
*  You're welcome.
*  Anela Rosa, Chuck.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  I'm going to probably need like 20 minutes.
*  Okay, all right.
*  Sorry, my niece.
*  Who was that?
*  My niece came by.
*  They're loading up the cars.
*  My cousin has a big boat, so they're going to load up the boat and take supplies to Lahaina,
*  to the ocean.
*  They need gas.
*  There's no gas station that has gas on the other side.
*  So the cars are running out of gas.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Okay.
*  She said they're doing a convoy with the police.
*  So they're taking ice and supplies and all that.
*  So they're gathering all that stuff.
*  While I'm talking to you, I'm not going to do any labor.
*  Do you need to go?
*  I don't want to keep you from an important task like that.
*  No, I have nieces and nephews.
*  They would never let me work anyway.
*  They would just do the work.
*  They wouldn't let me do anything.
*  That's fine.
*  Okay.
*  So, Anela, I wanted to go back to the beginning.
*  Tell me a little bit about yourself.
*  Where'd you grow up?
*  Well, my family's originally from the south side of Maui in an area called Malkenna.
*  I come from a very, very big family.
*  As a child, my grandmother had a point of taking us, the grandchildren, to Lahaina because
*  it's her stomping ground.
*  My grandmother was a hard woman.
*  If you didn't know her well, you wouldn't be able to get along with her.
*  She didn't take any crap from anybody, not even from her kids or grandchildren or anybody
*  else.
*  But she was raised in the Catholic.
*  We went to the Catholic church.
*  She showed us where her two brothers were buried.
*  So let us know that this is family.
*  This is where she's from.
*  This is where she grew up.
*  She gave us her history.
*  She took us down to Front Street.
*  They used to have an old theater.
*  They had a restaurant there, an Okazuya, where you'd grab like small bits of pieces to make
*  a little what they call bento, which is like a takeout lunch.
*  She took us to the beach that they went to to go fishing.
*  And she took us there to have a picnic.
*  So my ties to Lahaina is through her.
*  And then when I was my mid 20s, I think the job opportunity came available in the mid 80s.
*  I moved to Lahaina and I have been there ever since.
*  So how was it?
*  What was it like moving there?
*  What was it like living there once you got there?
*  It was I liked it.
*  I really did.
*  I like the busyness of Lahaina.
*  Rode my bike into Lahaina town afternoons after my shift.
*  And I saw a lot of tourists.
*  You don't see too many local people down in Front Street.
*  You see a lot of tourists because it is a tourist attraction.
*  And you see the excitement in the visitors.
*  You see the excitement as they see something new or something they've never seen before.
*  And it's a good thing to know that we grew up here.
*  We know this.
*  We see this all the time, but we cannot take it for granted.
*  I was looking for a church, but I wasn't anxious because I still wanted to play and have my
*  fun.
*  And then eventually I hooked up with my aunt and my uncle Earl.
*  They said, come to our church, which was wayola.
*  Just come to our church.
*  So I did.
*  And the church was always full.
*  We had to sit on the outside because church was just packed in those days.
*  And I kept coming and coming and coming.
*  That's what started my adventure at wayola.
*  So eventually I got involved with the church in different capacities from a young adult
*  leader to serving as a deacon, serving as a board member, being a treasurer, because
*  I felt that it was important that my young voice was heard amongst these elders because
*  they're not going to be around for very long.
*  And I need to learn from them what they did, what their thoughts were so that we could
*  carry on the history and the foundation of wayola church.
*  And I'm not sure if you're aware that we celebrated our 200th anniversary just a few months ago.
*  Oh my goodness, your 200th.
*  Yeah, we're the very first church that was built and founded on Maui.
*  Can you just tell me the history of the church?
*  The church was founded by Queen Te Opulani, and she was the highest ranked queen or highest
*  ranked ali'i in entire Hawai'i.
*  When the missionaries came, I think their first boat landed in 1820.
*  And in the old days, Hawaiians had their own gods, but she decided to open the doors and
*  say, no, let's hear what the gospel is saying and let's hear what these missionaries are
*  sharing.
*  So she heard it in Oahu, loved it, came to Maui, brought them, and wanted the Lahaina
*  people, her people of Lahaina, to hear the same word, to hear what she heard.
*  So having that under our belt, it meant a lot.
*  It meant a lot for us as a community, for our church, wayola.
*  So anyway, one particular minister who was helping us, she was what we called an interim,
*  she said, you know, Anela, you have great leadership skills.
*  You should look into becoming a pastor.
*  I'm like, eh, eh.
*  I am like the farthest perfect person for being a pastor.
*  I said, I still want to do bad stuff.
*  Oh God, I'm like the last person, please.
*  I still swear.
*  She said, no, no, no.
*  So I said, OK, I'll just go to classes.
*  We'll see.
*  It was a long journey.
*  What changed your mind, Anela?
*  Why did you decide to become a minister?
*  I mean, you sort of felt like you still wanted to do bad things, right?
*  What happened?
*  What changed?
*  I'm not saying I'm perfect.
*  And I tell my congregation every time, I am not a perfect person.
*  So don't look at me for that kind of stuff.
*  You're not going to get it.
*  I wanted to help wayola because in the time of trying to find a full-time ordained minister,
*  there weren't many local young people going to seminary school because it was quite expensive
*  and coming back to preach in our local churches.
*  So the last one, two, three, maybe I think the last three or four ministers we had were
*  all from the mainland.
*  They were from Hawaii.
*  So in order for me to make sure that our culture is taken into consideration in everything
*  that we do and in order to make sure that the people are comfortable, because I never
*  want our ordained minister that comes from the mainland not understand the history of
*  our church or of the people, because it's very, very important.
*  So, Anela, part of your decision to become a licensed minister for this church is to
*  carry forward the legacy of it in some ways, your history, your culture, to make sure it
*  survived and the culture around it survived.
*  Yes, that's exactly what it was.
*  And that's exactly what it is.
*  And you know, when they say that it takes a village to raise a child, this is exactly
*  how Laina has been that I have witnessed.
*  I have no children, but there are children in my life that I have watched grown up.
*  I have watched Mary.
*  I have watched have children.
*  I have watched them.
*  Maybe the child that I baptized 20 years ago comes back and tells me, I see, you know,
*  they always call me callable, but I see you baptized me.
*  I said, yeah, I remember.
*  I said, so what are you doing here today?
*  So I have a baby.
*  It's okay.
*  So they remember or I've watched them grow up.
*  And if I called him by name, I remember having this one boy who was about nine years old.
*  I called him by his first name.
*  He goes, how do you know me?
*  I said, because I baptized you.
*  You did?
*  I said, yeah, I'm talking to your mom.
*  I said, I baptized you.
*  So I want you to be good at it goes.
*  Whoa.
*  I mean, you know, those things.
*  So this community, this village is intense.
*  Everyone knows everyone.
*  Everyone knows your parents.
*  Everyone knows your grandparents.
*  So you really can't get away with much because people are watching,
*  but they're also guiding you.
*  They're also protecting you as much as they can.
*  That's how strong this community is.
*  And do you remember what it felt like giving the first sermon that you gave?
*  What did you remember walking into the church and talking in front of people for the first time?
*  What was that like?
*  Oh, my God, I can never forget that because I still have moments.
*  My stomach turned and I mean, I was just, I was in pieces.
*  You know, when I stepped up to the pulpit, I actually had to wait to take the last step up.
*  And I looked out to the graveyard because our pulpit is on that side of the cemetery.
*  I looked out to the graveyard and Uncle Earl's dad, my great uncle,
*  is buried out there with his wife and his family.
*  He was also a minister and he was very well known.
*  He was very popular in Lahaina and all over the island.
*  So I looked out and said,
*  Teacher Mann, help me.
*  Please give me the strength.
*  Do what I need to do so that people can help me and I can help them.
*  You looked out the window and saw the grave of your uncle's father and that gave you strength.
*  It did because his headstone stands out.
*  It's a kind of big black one.
*  It's right in line with the pulpit.
*  So I look at that.
*  I mean, I still look at it.
*  Even when I'm sitting down listening to music,
*  I look out there and I look and I'm thinking,
*  you set the foundation for my family, for all those behind me,
*  for the legacy behind me that I'm carrying, trying to carry forward
*  and the support in that way.
*  But my stomach still turns even to this day after 13 years,
*  when I step up to the pulpit and I still look out and I said,
*  Teacher Mann, papa, please help me.
*  Please guide me.
*  Let the words come out.
*  Oh, Judy.
*  She's just trying to call on my other phone.
*  I'm trying to get a hold of her for the last three days
*  because our conference is trying to send us money.
*  But the banks in Lahaina has burned.
*  The PO Box, our post office has burned.
*  So I told them, you can't send a check
*  because we have no place to get the mail.
*  It won't work.
*  The post office is gone.
*  Yeah.
*  My mind is just going in 20 different places.
*  Can you call me back maybe in about 10 minutes
*  and let me get some things cleared up with Judy?
*  Okay. Call you back.
*  Okay.
*  Bye.
*  Bye.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Anela, can you tell me when you first heard about the fire?
*  Where were you at that moment?
*  Well, the initial fire in the morning,
*  we were driving out to go to take care of some appointments.
*  In the morning, about 11 o'clock, we left our home.
*  I live in a subdivision,
*  which is probably about three or four miles from the church.
*  And as we're trying to make our way out,
*  we knew that the fire had happened,
*  but we had connections with someone at the police station,
*  our neighbor, she works there.
*  So we called her, it's a road open.
*  She goes, it is, but it's hard because the winds are blowing.
*  There's debris on the ground, but you can get out.
*  And I said, what about the fire?
*  She said, right now it's contained,
*  but they're just hoping that it doesn't flare up again.
*  I said, okay.
*  So we went thinking, okay, don't get it contained.
*  So on our way back, about two o'clock in the afternoon,
*  we got stopped in traffic on the bypass.
*  You couldn't even see the ocean.
*  You couldn't see the island of Lanai out there
*  because the smoke was just carrying.
*  The fire was on the top part of the bypass
*  and it had run across to the bottom part of the bypass.
*  All we saw was black smoke, then some white smoke,
*  and then more black smoke.
*  They said, oh my God, there's a little house down there
*  right where the fire was.
*  And it's right above the subdivision down by the water.
*  Oh my God, this fire is going to go across the street
*  to the families down there.
*  We have a member that lived there,
*  can't get through, we couldn't call anybody.
*  Self-service was down.
*  So I couldn't get through to anyone.
*  I didn't know where she was.
*  Didn't know if she was okay.
*  Then the police came.
*  This is already five hours sitting.
*  They told us that we need to evacuate.
*  People were just moving back.
*  They weren't leaving.
*  They were just moving back, hoping that the road would open.
*  So I looked at my cousin who was with me, a girl's daughter,
*  and I told her, what do you want to do?
*  Do you want to go to Nauani's house in Wai'ihuk
*  or do you want to just stay in the line?
*  She said, no, let's just go to Wai'ihuk
*  and let's just hang out there until they open the road.
*  And then the fire moved north towards where Uncle Earl,
*  the minister that I talked about, the my uncle and auntie,
*  their house burned.
*  I see.
*  And my niece finally got a hold of me today
*  because I didn't know where they were.
*  We couldn't find them.
*  We couldn't get out.
*  We're just, oh my gosh, where are they?
*  So she finally called.
*  She said, auntie, we're fine.
*  But she said, auntie, I don't know about our house.
*  She said, honey, the house is gone.
*  I said, sister and papa's house is gone.
*  You're out.
*  Your house is gone.
*  Dad's house is gone.
*  Anela, did you say that your house was gone?
*  No, my house is fine.
*  My nephew made it to our house.
*  He was dousing our house from yesterday with water
*  just to make sure that it didn't catch on fire.
*  Wow.
*  When did you discover that the fire had started to move north toward the church?
*  When I saw a posting on either Facebook or Instagram
*  that somebody shared with me and they said, wayola church.
*  So I looked at it.
*  It was just up the church, just the hall.
*  That's what that picture is.
*  And it was just in flames, just flying flames.
*  Did you think you'd lost it?
*  I did because the young man that lives in the corner,
*  Toma, who is a member, he used to want to take care of our graveyards.
*  He was there trying to shoot water on the building, trying to save it.
*  But he said the police came, told him he had to evacuate.
*  He said already the hall was up in flames.
*  He said the church, a spark had already hit the roof.
*  But he didn't know how it was meant because he had to evacuate.
*  And then today someone texted me a picture of the church.
*  The front of the building, which is all concrete,
*  and the back building is still standing.
*  But everything in the middle, all wood, is gone.
*  Our hall, which is all wood, is gone.
*  The building behind it, there are three structures.
*  The building behind it, which we housed, our Puananaleo,
*  which is the preschool, Hawaiian immersion, that building is gone.
*  What was it like to see that?
*  When you got that text on your phone,
*  what was the first thing that came to your mind?
*  Well, it was a little bit of delight because not everything was taken.
*  I had heard rumors that the church was completely down to the ground.
*  And then when I saw the picture, I looked at the front lawn.
*  It was still green.
*  The TVs were still green.
*  A little bit of the foundation is still there.
*  And the backside where we had stained glass windows, they're still standing.
*  And the front door that had stained glass windows, they're still standing.
*  But to see that part, there's hope.
*  We had a meeting last night with our conference minister and other pastors.
*  And I told him, I said, you know, it's just a building.
*  I want to make sure that our congregation is safe, our community, the people are safe.
*  And it may sound cliche, but it really, you know, we can rebuild.
*  The church has a history of rebuilding itself.
*  And we will.
*  But my concern really at the moment was the people that making sure that everybody was safe.
*  And how are the people, Anila?
*  As far as I can see, Judy was the last person.
*  I shouldn't say last person.
*  She's one of the persons I couldn't get a hold of.
*  Gordon, who was also a strong member, just left the board, but he was part of our building and ground.
*  He lived down the road.
*  I don't know where he is.
*  I haven't heard from him.
*  And then the church has rentals behind the wharf, which is further down the street.
*  Some of them were evacuated.
*  And I think I heard that one of our church members who lives there, he was evacuated and he's fine.
*  One other person that lives behind the wharf, Susan, I don't know where she is.
*  But I'm trying to find out from other people, have you been in contact with so and so?
*  And everyone's looking for each other.
*  I mean, I don't even have to ask.
*  They go, oh, I saw Kaina or I can't get a hold of so.
*  Oh, I saw Claire.
*  Things like that.
*  So they're reaching out to let me know that if they reach someone, then they let me know
*  or they let each other know.
*  So because I mean, our congregation, everybody's worried about each other.
*  Yeah.
*  So it sounds like there's still a small handful of people who are missing.
*  There is.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just thinking that they're safe, but there's just no way to communicate with them.
*  That's what I'm praying for.
*  Right.
*  That there's just not signal where they happen to be right now.
*  Right.
*  Have you lost anybody outside your congregation, Anela?
*  I don't know.
*  Because the first count of six people, I don't know who they were.
*  The next count, they came out of 30 something.
*  I don't know who they were, but I'm not sure.
*  I mean, just your heart, just everything that this catastrophe can be as big as it was.
*  And seen all the pictures, seen the helicopter that took the video.
*  I'm like, oh my gosh, this is, this is devastating.
*  This is, I just worked, just couldn't come out.
*  I'm like, I had my moments where I just, just started crying because look at me now,
*  thinking about all the families, the friends, you know,
*  and the loss and we don't know how many people we lost.
*  And there's still people missing and not accounted for.
*  So amongst the, the rubbish or whatever that's left the ash, I'm sure they'll find
*  probably people of all those people that passed.
*  I'm sure we'll know a few of them because again, it's a small community.
*  Anela, what does Front Street look like now?
*  Ash, honestly, just ash.
*  It looks like destruction.
*  I only know what a war zone looks like from pictures that I watched on movies,
*  but it was described as a war zone.
*  The pictures that were shared on the internet of videos,
*  you could barely recognize where the places were.
*  And I'm looking at them, I'm like, oh gosh, that's the harbor.
*  I said, oh, okay, that building is stopped by the Banyan tree.
*  I said, oh, that's the, the Porco share where the people used to wait for their boats.
*  And yeah, they're moving down the line.
*  I'm like, where is that?
*  I'm like, I mean, I just, I couldn't place it.
*  I'm like, oh my gosh, it's coming up through the elementary school.
*  And I'm only seeing pictures.
*  So until I'm there for the moment, I had to grasp the moment and just take a deep breath.
*  We walked here, we talked here, we ate here, we sat here, we sang here,
*  you know, we did all of those things.
*  And until that happens, it's hard to grasp.
*  It's really hard to put it into words.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you have plans to go to see with your own eyes in the coming days, if you can?
*  If they open the road, I want to go home and look at the church and just,
*  just, you know, see it for myself with my own eyes.
*  Will you have a church service this Sunday?
*  If I get back home, I'll be there.
*  If I get home and they allow me to go down to that area, I will show up.
*  I won't have a service prepared as I normally do.
*  But if there's still shaded area right at the edge between the graveyard and the church,
*  so we'll probably sit around there if I can get cured and just probably do a prayer and just
*  hear from everybody and let everybody just speak their voice and just share, you know,
*  what their needs are and see if we can, we can co-core them in any way by reaching out.
*  It feels like it's important.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I remember the history of when Queen Liliuokuleni was being overthrown
*  and the congregation at that time, the minister was on the side of overthrowing the queen
*  where the congregation was not.
*  So the doors of the church were closed, but the people, they had church somewhere else
*  until they were able to get that pastor out and then they came back to the church.
*  So I think coming, thinking of that story, that always comes back to me.
*  I'm like, those are strong congregants.
*  That's what the church is about.
*  It's about surviving.
*  It's about being together.
*  And I hope that this is where we move forward from with the congregation now.
*  I really hope so.
*  And I have faith in my congregation that they will.
*  I believe their belief is very strong and their faith is very strong.
*  Thank you so much for your time and for talking to me, even though I know you have so much going on.
*  You're welcome.
*  Thank you.
*  Bye.
*  Okay.
*  Aloha.
*  Bye.
*  After several attempts to reach her church over the weekend, Anela was unable to get there.
*  She said rescue workers had blocked off the area and told people to stay away
*  as they continued to identify victims.
*  The recovery effort was hampered by the sheer scale of the destruction.
*  Over 2000 buildings were destroyed.
*  The vast majority residential and authorities estimated it would cost over $5 billion to rebuild.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Friday, Attorney General Merrick Garland elevated the federal prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden
*  to the status of special counsel after negotiations to revive a plea deal on tax and gun charges
*  fell apart.
*  Up until a few days ago, the two sides had been hoping to salvage the deal.
*  But that effort hit a snag when Biden demanded blanket immunity from future prosecution.
*  As special counsel, David Weiss, who's also the U.S. attorney in Delaware,
*  can now pursue charges in any jurisdiction he chooses
*  without seeking the cooperation of local federal prosecutors.
*  The move raised the possibility that Biden could be tried in the politically charged case
*  and that the 2024 election could have questions about the legal fate
*  not only of a former president but also of the current president's son.
