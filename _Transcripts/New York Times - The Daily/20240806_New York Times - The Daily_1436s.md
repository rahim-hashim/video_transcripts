# What Just Happened on Wall Street?
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgFSkG39OQ4)
*  Hey, it's Michael.
*  Before we get started, I want to share some exciting news about another daily news show
*  from the Times called The Headlines.
*  Here on the Daily, we tell one story a day.
*  The Headlines, hosted by my colleague Tracy Mumford, brings you the day's top stories,
*  along with insights and analysis that you've come to know from Times reporters in the newsroom,
*  all in about 10 minutes.
*  Something you can listen to alongside the Daily.
*  Anyway, the news is that you can now find The Headlines wherever you get your podcasts.
*  So search for it and subscribe to it.
*  And now, here's today's Daily.
*  We have breaking news this hour.
*  The stock market in some very troubling territory.
*  Take a good look at your screen if you're moving around because this is a live look
*  at the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over 800 points so far.
*  My name is Gina Smilick.
*  I'm the Fed and Economy reporter here at the New York Times.
*  And I'm watching the markets here at the Open.
*  Nearly everything on Wall Street is down.
*  The S&P fell 1.8%.
*  And the Nasdaq, the tech-heavy index where we've seen some of the biggest losses, that
*  is down over 6%.
*  And I have been watching them in real time as they plummet.
*  They have never been down a thousand points ever, not even intraday on the Nasdaq.
*  Is that true?
*  That is true.
*  And volatility is just spiking across markets.
*  Microsoft is down 5%.
*  Alphabet, 5%.
*  Meta, 6%.
*  Apple, 9%.
*  It's been a morning of just pure carnage.
*  A relatively calm year on Wall Street is no more.
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Boborio.
*  This is the Daily.
*  Today.
*  Why every major U.S. stock market plunged on Monday, wiping out hundreds of billions
*  of dollars in value.
*  And what the dizzying sell-off can tell us about whether the American economy is now
*  headed for a recession.
*  My colleague, Gina Smilik, is our guest.
*  It's Tuesday, August 6.
*  Gina, let's start with the big question of the day.
*  Why have the markets been utterly seized by panic and taken a huge nosedive over the past
*  24 hours?
*  And how does that fit into the larger economic story that we have been telling on the show,
*  mostly through you over the past few years, which is the story of the U.S. government's
*  efforts to try to lower inflation, to bring down record high prices by using the tool
*  of higher interest rates, which of course make borrowing more expensive, and doing that
*  without pushing the economy into a recession.
*  Yeah.
*  So the big question, literally since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest
*  rates to bring down inflation, was can we get inflation down without causing a recession?
*  Right.
*  And up until very recently, it looked like the answer to that was basically yes.
*  Inflation was coming down and the economy was still growing and the job market stayed
*  strong.
*  But over the past few days, we've gotten a couple of pretty important economic reports
*  from the U.S. government that have suggested that the U.S. might not be steering clear
*  of a recession to the degree that we had thought it had previously.
*  So what we're seeing in markets today is a reaction to that, and it's kind of been magnified
*  by some technical things that are happening, but fundamentally, the story that we're seeing
*  play out right now is people getting nervous that the U.S. might be headed for a recession.
*  Okay.
*  Well, talk about those numbers that came out over the past few days that are fueling that
*  worry that we might be headed for the recession that we have so far avoided for the past couple
*  of years.
*  Yeah.
*  So it really started last Thursday, which is the day that we get our weekly jobless
*  claims numbers.
*  So as a reminder, these are new applications for unemployment benefits.
*  They're sort of a proxy for people losing their jobs.
*  And those jobless claims numbers jumped.
*  By how much?
*  Pretty significantly.
*  So they jumped by 14,000, which took them to the highest level in almost a year.
*  Okay.
*  So not a good number.
*  Not a good number, but the claims data are pretty prone to big swings, especially during
*  the summer.
*  And so that wasn't enough in and of itself to cause people to be really, really nervous.
*  What really made people nervous came on Friday.
*  So on the first Friday of every month, we get the monthly jobs report.
*  This is sort of the big indicator of how the job market is doing in any given month.
*  And it gives you two really big numbers.
*  The first is just the overall hiring number.
*  How many people, employers added to their payrolls over the past month.
*  The second is the unemployment rate.
*  And both of those metrics looked a little bit worse in this report than economists had
*  expected.
*  So what we saw was people were hiring at a much less rapid pace than they had previously
*  been.
*  And the unemployment rate jumped up by a couple of tenths, which while it was only a little
*  bit, it added to a pretty significant move up in the unemployment rate that's taken
*  place over the past year and which has really been accelerating over the past six months.
*  And so taken together, this set of data that we got on Friday, the slowdown in hiring,
*  the pop-up in the unemployment rate combined with the jumping claims we saw on Thursday
*  and some other weakening data that we've seen in the job market really put economy watchers
*  on notice.
*  You know, people are starting to put these numbers together and worry that the state
*  of the job market is really deteriorating pretty quickly here.
*  And that matters because the job market is really the clearest and their earliest signal
*  of a recession.
*  So in short, by the end of last week, the red lights are starting to flash and the panic
*  is beginning to creep up.
*  I don't know if I call it panic, but definitely worries are starting to creep in.
*  And compounding all of this, the Fed literally just reinforced their rate setting last week.
*  They had a meeting on Wednesday right before all of this bad labor market data came out,
*  at which they decided to keep interest rates on hold at their current level, 5.3%, which
*  is two decade high, because they wanted a little bit more confidence that inflation
*  was coming under control and they felt pretty good about the job market situation and thought
*  that it could handle a couple more months of high interest rates.
*  And so they left rates on hold at this very high level just before we saw this deterioration
*  in the job data.
*  Got it.
*  I want to put all this together because it's kind of fascinating.
*  So investors are processing a lot of information.
*  By Friday of last week, they are seeing that the job market is slowing down.
*  They will understand that is central to the question of whether or not we're headed for
*  recession.
*  And they're processing that the government's most powerful tool for making the situation
*  better, which is cutting interest rates, is not one that the Fed is going to employ right
*  now.
*  Maybe it will down the road.
*  And obviously that combination leads a bunch of investors to decide that this is a moment
*  to look at their stocks and rather than hold on to them and hope they're going to keep
*  going up, assume that bad things are ahead and they should sell them.
*  I think that's a big part of the story.
*  I think that investors are looking around and saying, yeah, we expect the Fed to cut
*  rates in September.
*  They were always going to cut rates in September, right?
*  Like before before the sell off happened.
*  But is September going to be too late to avert a heart landing in the economy?
*  And why do you think, Gina, that stock markets didn't just fall, but fell so much on Monday,
*  a thousand points, for example, in the Dow alone?
*  Reasons.
*  All of this started in fundamentals and concerns over the state of the economy, but it pretty
*  quickly became exacerbated by technical stuff.
*  So the first is the different central banks are doing different things right now.
*  Japan is raising rates.
*  The US is talking about cutting them.
*  And when global central bank policies diverge, you can really see currency values diverge
*  as well. And that's relevant to markets because there are traders around the world who are
*  have positions that are based on the value of an underlying currency.
*  And when those currencies move, you can see those traders have to pretty quickly unwind
*  those positions and sell the assets.
*  And so that's probably causing some of the selling we're seeing right now.
*  Got it. Which is clearly something that happened over the past day.
*  Yes. The second thing that's really important here is that stocks were just very high going
*  into this. They had really been sort of buoyed up by optimism about things like artificial
*  intelligence and some of the big tech stories we've been talking about.
*  And that means that they had a long way to fall.
*  You know, there was just a lot of room for them to come down here.
*  And then I think the final thing is that sometimes when you've got a sell off in the market,
*  selling leads to more selling.
*  You've got a situation where some traders are going to be looking at their positions and
*  saying, oh, we might have people sort of pull out of these or there will be a trigger at
*  which they have to pull out of these if they keep falling.
*  And so traders have to sell things in order to raise cash in order to sort of meet those
*  requests as they come in.
*  And so I think that's what we've seen.
*  We've seen a situation where the market moves are kind of snowballing upon themselves.
*  So all that makes me wonder why the Federal Reserve, to avoid more selling off and to
*  lessen all this anxiety, doesn't just get together and make an interest rate cut, right?
*  Like, do it tomorrow, because wouldn't that bring stock prices right back up and kind
*  of make everything bad that just happened in all these markets go away?
*  Right. The Fed does not set policy based on what is happening in the stock market.
*  The Fed sets policy based on what is happening in the real economy.
*  And when it comes to the real economy, I think they're not convinced that things are
*  absolutely falling apart yet.
*  And I think they worry that if they were to react very swiftly to this, if they were to
*  make an interest rate cut in between their meetings, which is what we in the press call
*  an emergency interest rate cut, they would really stoke the sense of panic.
*  They would make people feel like they knew something that like something was really going
*  horribly wrong in the economy.
*  And I just don't think that they feel confident that that is where we are at this point.
*  This was one point of data and they are not ready to freak out.
*  At least not yet.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Gina, help us understand why the people who are in the press are so
*  concerned about the Fed.
*  They're concerned about the Fed.
*  They're concerned about the Fed.
*  They're concerned about the Fed.
*  Gina, help us understand why the people who run the Federal Reserve can put aside all
*  the panic in the markets and decide this is not a moment to pull on the emergency break.
*  Why do they see more strength than freaked out investors do in the US economy right now?
*  Right. I've talked to some Fed officials since the job market data came out on Friday.
*  And I think that the overwhelming sense here is that they are wary.
*  They are watching this data.
*  They are watching for signs the job market is cracking.
*  But at the same time, they're not panicking.
*  So I think that the Fed is really at this moment taking a long view.
*  And I think it's really important to review sort of how we got to this moment.
*  Back in 2021 and 2022, we saw inflation really start to take off as we were coming out of
*  the pandemic recession.
*  So we briefly had a very sharp slowdown in the US.
*  The economy kind of rocketed back.
*  And as the economy rocketed back, price increases really popped.
*  Right. In part because the government spent so much money making sure that consumers
*  could get through the pandemic recovery.
*  Right. And in part because we had global supply chain problems and a whole variety of other
*  issues that really sort of contributed to inflation.
*  And the way that the Fed dealt with that was by starting in early 2022, raising interest
*  rates really sharply in order to slow down the economy, bring inflation under control.
*  And when that happened, it was pretty broadly expected that they might cause a recession
*  in the process. It's very hard to slow down the economy just enough to cool off inflation
*  without slowing it down so much that you cause a recession.
*  And so that was the big concern back in 2022 and 2023.
*  If daily listeners listen to us back then, that was what we were talking about all the
*  time was, is the Fed going to cause a hard landing?
*  Because there's no such thing as a Goldilocks economy where you're trying to conquer
*  inflation and you're somehow not inflicting damage on things like the employment market.
*  We kept talking about that nonstop.
*  It's impossible to get this just right.
*  Yeah, it seemed very unlikely, especially based on sort of historical precedent.
*  But what we've seen is this really encouraging outlook late in 2023 and then early
*  this year. We saw inflation coming down pretty nicely.
*  We saw consumer spending really holding up.
*  People are still taking vacations.
*  They're still spending on a whole variety of goods and services.
*  And we actually saw overall growth hold up.
*  We recently got a GDP number that showed that the economy expanded by 2.8 percent on an
*  annual basis in the second quarter, which is pretty solid growth.
*  And so altogether, it just kind of seemed like the Fed was nailing this.
*  It seemed like they were really getting that soft landing we'd all been hoping for.
*  And only recently, only in these last couple of data points with the creep up and the
*  unemployment rate turning into something more serious and jobless claims starting to
*  really take a move higher.
*  I think have we started to consider that we might not be nailing this off landing, that
*  actually these things are in trouble.
*  OK, well, let's assume for the sake of argument that in the coming weeks and maybe a
*  month or so, more evidence comes the Fed's way, suggesting that the economy is not doing
*  well. What can we anticipate the Fed's reaction will be?
*  If their thinking starts to turn the way of investors who have been selling off all these
*  stocks. So we were already widely expecting a rate cut in September.
*  I think most economists will tell you that given this slowdown in the job market, the
*  question is how big that rate cut is going to be.
*  So early on, we were expecting just a quarter point cut.
*  But if you look at where markets are priced now, if you talk to most Fed watchers, they'll
*  tell you that a larger rate cut is probably likely if the job market continues to slow
*  down.
*  So the Fed may decide that it needs to veer from its plan.
*  This plan has been working pretty well.
*  And if they did cut interest rates more than they had previously said they would, would
*  that be an acknowledgement, Gina, that they have taken too long to act, that they
*  have been too slow?
*  I think that they would say that they never had a hard and fast plan at this stage.
*  You know, I think policy in a moment like this has to be pretty reactive to the economic
*  conditions. And they've been pretty clear about that for some time.
*  And then I think the second thing is, yeah, to some extent, I think if you are getting
*  signs that the job market is really slowing down, that you're moving a little bit late,
*  when you're late, you play catch up.
*  And so catch up would look like potentially larger interest rate decreases.
*  And so I think that if that is what comes to pass, that's probably how people will read
*  it.
*  What's so interesting about this moment is that I think it's fair to say we tend to
*  associate bad economic moments, recessions, with big singular events.
*  You know, 9-11, the collapse of the housing market, the pandemic.
*  That's what we think of when we think about the U.S.
*  economy going into recession.
*  The idea that we might be heading into a recession now is just fundamentally weirder,
*  because if it happens, it will have been because our government successfully staved
*  it off for a few years through this very delicate process of raising interest rates
*  to fight inflation.
*  And the idea is that eventually it can't keep a lid on this, right?
*  You know, cat in the hat style, the plates and the balls and the rakes, they all fall.
*  And it's going to be harder to assign blame for that if and when it happens.
*  Yeah. So recently, the recessions that we've been having have been a little bit
*  different. They've really been caused by these big external events.
*  So in the most recent instance, obviously, that was a pandemic.
*  But putting on my economics nerd hat here a little bit, as is my lot in life, I think
*  I would actually compare this most to the early 1980s recession.
*  That was a pretty bad one. And I'm not going to say that this moment would necessarily
*  be that bad. But what is similar here is that it was a moment of economic slowdown
*  that was really caused by the Fed's attempts to control inflation.
*  And I think that this would be a very similar episode.
*  And in that instance, everybody blamed the Fed and Paul Volcker for raising interest
*  rates and causing a recession. And he was not a popular figure during it.
*  And it was very much seen as a huge policy problem and a big black eye on the Fed.
*  But with the sort of passing of time, I think people came to see it as the Fed having
*  successfully contained inflation.
*  You know, the reviews of that 1980s recession got a little bit sunnier with time.
*  And so I think there'd be a real question.
*  You know, is this episode seen similarly?
*  Do people think that the Fed has made a huge policy error and that this is a big
*  mistake and that we should all roundly blame them?
*  Or do people see this as sort of a necessary evil that they caused a hard landing, but
*  they had to do it to get inflation under control?
*  I think those are big questions. And they'll matter a lot for the legacy of Jerome Powell,
*  who's the current Fed chair and who has been getting a lot of plaudits recently for
*  having gently landed the plane.
*  And I think if it turns out that the plane is in for actually a hard landing, there
*  are going to be some questions about his legacy here.
*  Questions that it seems really began to crystallize on Monday.
*  Yeah, I would say that's the case.
*  So I don't think we can end this conversation without recognizing that this stock market
*  sell off and the fears of a recession that underlie it are occurring in the middle of
*  a general election for president.
*  And a lot has changed in that race over the past few weeks, almost all of it pretty
*  positive for the Democrats who are the incumbents in this race.
*  But incumbents are almost always seen as responsible for the economy and by extension,
*  the stock market, which, as we are discussing, is in some real turmoil as of Monday.
*  And it feels worth lingering on all of that for just a moment.
*  Yeah, so there is a big question here over who is going to own this moment.
*  You know, I think we've got a complicated situation because the incumbent president,
*  Joe Biden, is not running for reelection.
*  His vice president, Kamala Harris, is, but are voters going to attribute this to her?
*  Are they going to blame the stock market sell off on her?
*  I don't think that's entirely clear.
*  We've seen former president Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, really trying to
*  pin this on Kamala Harris.
*  But is that going to carry water?
*  I think that's an open question.
*  And then just to add to all of this political complication, you've got the Fed
*  preparing to cut interest rates.
*  Some investors and economists think it's likely that they're going to go both in
*  September and in November, just a couple of days after the election.
*  And that's complicated because the Fed is independent of the political situation.
*  You know, they are not they are not beholden to the White House and they try to be very
*  clear that they're politically independent.
*  But this is going to plunge them right into the political fray right around the
*  election. President Trump has already said that and applied the cutting interest
*  rates near the election would be a political attempt to help the Democrats.
*  The Democrats are very carefully not talking about the Fed at the moment.
*  But I think that this is going to be just a very fraught moment for the Fed politically
*  going forward here.
*  Right. Because we may have a situation where one side is rooting for the Fed to do
*  what it thinks will help them and the other side may be rooting for the Fed not to do
*  it because it may help the opponent.
*  Right. And then I think to add complication to the situation, I think no matter what
*  side you're on, you're kind of hoping that the Fed manages to pull this off and not
*  cause a recession because what president wants to be in office next year during a
*  recession, you know, recessions don't clear up in 25 seconds.
*  There are just layers upon layers of political complication here.
*  So this current economic moment is really playing out on multiple levels.
*  There's this Fed level.
*  You know, the Fed's removed from politics, but its legacy and its reputation are very
*  much on the line here.
*  There's this political level.
*  The White House doesn't really have all that much control over this situation, but
*  the outcome of the presidential election is ultimately going to be pretty potentially
*  shaped by it.
*  And then, of course, there's this sort of human level.
*  The American people are the ones who are going to be in office next year.
*  The American people are going to be directly and potentially pretty profoundly
*  affected by the outcome.
*  Gina, as always, thank you very much.
*  Thank you, Michael.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you need to NURDAY.
*  In a landmark ruling on Monday, a federal judge found that Google had acted illegally
*  to maintain a monopoly in online search.
*  The decision endorsed claims made by the U.S.
*  government that Google has denied its competitors a chance to grow by spending
*  billions of dollars a year to become the automatic search engine on many consumer
*  devices. The ruling does not offer remedies for Google's behavior, which will be
*  decided in the coming months.
*  But those remedies could eventually include forcing Google to sell off parts of its
*  business. And
*  the prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, has resigned and fled the country
*  as protesters stormed her residence and set fire to government offices.
*  It was a dramatic end to Hasina's reign, which has become increasingly authoritarian,
*  prompting massive protests and violent government crackdowns.
*  Everybody had to adapt to the depressed environment and order in which their
*  dollars were財, bury money and tangle dry ground.
*  And these stores in this blo valid Universal came from very없ed
