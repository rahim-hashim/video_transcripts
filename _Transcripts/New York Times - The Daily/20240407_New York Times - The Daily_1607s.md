# The Sunday Read: ‘What Deathbed Visions Teach Us About Living’
**New York Times Podcasts:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbjS3nDcxCY)
*  Hi, my name is Phoebe Zerwick and I'm a contributor to the New York Times Magazine.
*  For this week's Sunday Read, we'll be sharing a recent article for the magazine about death
*  bed visions, visions that people experience as they're dying.
*  These visions can begin days, weeks, maybe even months before someone passes away.
*  And they can cover a whole range of subjects, but they tend to center on the patient's
*  earlier life and lived experience.
*  As death approaches, people will begin to see friends and relatives, even pets whom
*  they loved, who preceded them in death.
*  They might even hear the person speak or smell their perfume.
*  People describe these deathbed visions as realer than real, as different from any other
*  kinds of dreams that they've ever had.
*  So this story is based on the research by a physician named Dr. Chris Kerr, who works
*  at Hospice Buffalo.
*  He believed that these deathbed visions were completely different from delusions or hallucinations
*  brought on by medication.
*  And so Kerr's team interviewed his patients and their relatives.
*  They found that these experiences were common among a majority of patients, an astonishing
*  88% in their first study.
*  Dr. Kerr often says that he hasn't discovered anything new.
*  He's just reclaimed wisdom that's been lost to modern medicine.
*  In the past century, death moved from people's homes and into a hospital setting.
*  It became medicalized, with machines beeping and doctors and nurses rushing around.
*  And to appreciate these end-of-life experiences, you need a little bit of quiet and time to
*  just talk.
*  Otherwise they might go unnoticed.
*  I should say, I'm not religious.
*  I don't have beliefs about the afterlife.
*  Normally I write about topics like mass incarceration, abortion, or the refugee crisis.
*  Deathbed visions are something that I'd never heard of, until I encountered it in my own
*  life.
*  You'll hear about that later on.
*  But after that experience, I was compelled to report on it.
*  Last June, I spent about a week at Hospice Buffalo with Dr. Kerr.
*  I met some of his patients or their surviving relatives, sitting back and letting people
*  tell their stories.
*  I understand you were seeing your mom too.
*  She showed up.
*  She was waving to you or something, right?
*  Just standing over here.
*  One patient, Peggy Helosky, said that she had been visited by her mother, who was waiting
*  for her.
*  How long ago did she pass?
*  Eleven years.
*  You'll smile on her face.
*  You think you'll be seeing her more?
*  I will.
*  Peggy also saw her dog.
*  I saw Kasha.
*  She was smiling.
*  Kasha didn't bark.
*  I'm in peace with everybody.
*  I'm happy.
*  I'm okay.
*  I know it's not time yet.
*  I'm like quite ready yet.
*  But it's coming.
*  Dr. Kerr's patients told me that being with and talking to their relatives about their
*  visions, that it provided a kind of comfort and peace to them.
*  Their relatives said that knowing that the person they loved was not scared of what lay
*  ahead, of death, made their grief much more bearable.
*  Since my article was published, so many people have shared their own stories.
*  Some people interpret this as evidence of an afterlife.
*  Some is something about the power of our inner mind or consciousness.
*  Others is just love in its purest form.
*  Personally, I don't want to put a label on it myself.
*  But the fact is, someday, we're all going to reach the end of our own lives.
*  And as the research bears out, when that does happen, people tend to find these visions
*  helpful or spiritually meaningful.
*  So this story is an attempt to explain them.
*  So here's my article, read by Samantha Dez.
*  Our audio producer is Jack DeSodoro.
*  The original music you'll hear was written and performed by Aaron Esposito.
*  Chris Kerr was 12 when he first observed a deathbed vision.
*  His memory of that summer in 1974 is blurred, but not the sense of mystery he felt at the
*  bedside of his dying father.
*  Throughout Kerr's childhood in Toronto, his father, a surgeon, was too busy to spend
*  much time with his son, except for an annual fishing trip they took, just the two of them,
*  to the Canadian wilderness.
*  Gaunt and weakened by cancer at 42, his father reached for the buttons on Kerr's shirt,
*  fiddled with them, and said something about getting ready to catch the plane to their
*  cabin in the woods.
*  I knew intuitively, I knew wherever he was must be a good place because we were going
*  fishing, Kerr told me.
*  As he moved to touch his father, Kerr felt a hand on his shoulder.
*  A priest had followed him into the hospital room and was now leading him away, telling
*  him his father was delusional.
*  Kerr's father died early the next morning.
*  Kerr now calls what he witnessed an end-of-life vision.
*  His father wasn't delusional, he believes.
*  His mind was taking him to a time and place where he and his son could be together, in
*  the wilds of northern Canada.
*  And the priest, he feels, made a mistake, one that many other caregivers make, of dismissing
*  the moment as a break with reality, as something from which the boy required protection.
*  It would be more than 40 years before Kerr felt compelled to speak about that evening
*  in the hospital room.
*  He had followed his father and three generations before him into medicine and was working at
*  Hospice and Palliative Care Buffalo, where he was the chief medical officer and conducted
*  research on end-of-life visions.
*  It wasn't until he gave a TEDx talk in 2015 that he shared the story of his father's
*  death.
*  Pacing the stage in the sport coat he always wears, he told the audience,
*  My point here is I didn't choose this topic of dying.
*  I feel it has chosen or followed me.
*  He went on,
*  When I was present at the bedside of the dying, I was confronted by what I had seen and tried
*  so hard to forget from my childhood.
*  I saw dying patients reaching and calling out to mothers and to fathers and to children,
*  many of whom hadn't been seen for many years.
*  But what was remarkable was so many of them looked at peace.
*  The talk received millions of views and thousands of comments, many from nurses grateful that
*  someone in the medical field validated what they have long understood.
*  Others too posted personal stories of having witnessed loved ones' visions in their final
*  days.
*  For them, Kerr's message was a kind of confirmation of something they instinctively knew, that
*  deathbed visions are real, can provide comfort, even heal past trauma, that they can, in some
*  cases, feel transcendent, that our minds are capable of conjuring images that help us,
*  at the end, make sense of our lives.
*  Nothing in Kerr's medical training prepared him for his first shift at Hospice Buffalo
*  one Saturday morning in the spring of 1999.
*  He had earned a degree from the Medical College of Ohio while working on a PhD in neurobiology.
*  After a residency in internal medicine, Kerr started a fellowship in cardiology in Buffalo.
*  To earn extra money to support his wife and two young daughters, he took a part-time job
*  with Hospice Buffalo.
*  Until then, Kerr had worked in the conventional medical system, focused on patients who were
*  often tethered to machines or heavily medicated.
*  If they recounted visions, he had no time to listen.
*  But in the quiet of Hospice, Kerr found himself in the presence of something he hadn't seen
*  since his father's death.
*  Patients who spoke of people and places visible only to them.
*  So, just like with my father, there's just this feeling of reverence, of something that
*  wasn't understood but certainly felt, he says.
*  During one of his shifts, Kerr was checking on a 70-year-old woman named Mary, whose grown
*  children had gathered in her room, drinking wine to lighten the mood.
*  Without warning, Kerr remembers, Mary sat up in her bed and crossed her arms at her
*  chest.
*  Danny, she cooed, kissing and cuddling a baby only she could see.
*  At first, her children were confused.
*  There was no Danny in the family, no baby in their mother's arms.
*  But they could sense that whatever their mother was experiencing brought her a sense of calm.
*  Kerr later learned that long before her four children were born, Mary lost a baby in childbirth.
*  She never spoke of it with her children.
*  But now she was, through a vision, seemingly addressing that loss.
*  In observing Mary's final days at hospice, Kerr found his calling.
*  I was disillusioned by the assembly-line nature of medicine, Kerr told me.
*  This felt like a more humane and dignified model of care.
*  He quit cardiology to work full-time at the bedsides of dying patients.
*  Many of them described visions that drew from their lives and seemed to hold meaning,
*  unlike hallucinations resulting from medication or delusional incoherent thinking, which can
*  also occur at the end of life.
*  But Kerr couldn't persuade other doctors, even young residents making the rounds with
*  him at hospice, of their value.
*  They wanted scientific proof.
*  At the time, only a handful of published medical studies had documented deathbed visions, and
*  they largely relied on second-hand reports from doctors and other caregivers, rather
*  than accounts from patients themselves.
*  On a flight home from a conference, Kerr outlined a study of his own, and in 2010 a research
*  fellow, Anne Banas, signed on to conduct it with him.
*  Like Kerr, Banas had a family member who, before his death, experienced visions.
*  A grandfather who imagined himself in a train station with his brothers.
*  The study wasn't designed to answer how these visions differ neurologically from hallucinations
*  or delusions.
*  Rather, Kerr saw his role as chronicler of his patients' experiences.
*  Borrowing from social science research methods, Kerr, Banas, and their colleagues based their
*  study on daily interviews with patients in the 22-bed inpatient unit at the hospice campus,
*  in the hope of capturing the frequency and varied subject matter of their visions.
*  Patients were screened to ensure that they were lucid and not in a confused or delirious
*  state.
*  The research, published in 2014 in the Journal of Palliative Medicine, found that visions
*  are far more common and frequent than other researchers had found, with an astonishing
*  88% of patients reporting at least one vision.
*  Later studies in Japan, India, Sweden, and Australia confirm that visions are common.
*  The percentages range from about 20 to 80%, though a majority of these studies rely on
*  interviews with caregivers and not patients.
*  In the last 10 years, Kerr has hired a permanent research team who expanded the studies to
*  include interviews with patients receiving hospice care at home and with their families,
*  deepening the researchers' understanding of the variety and profundity of these visions.
*  They can occur while patients are asleep or fully conscious.
*  Dead family members figure most prominently, and by contrast, visions involving religious
*  themes are exceedingly rare.
*  Patients often relive seminal moments from their lives, including joyful experiences
*  of falling in love and painful ones of rejection.
*  Some dream of the unresolved tasks of daily life, like paying bills or raising children.
*  Visions also entail past or imagined journeys, whether long car trips or short walks to school.
*  Regardless of the subject matter, the visions, patients say, feel real and entirely unique
*  compared with anything else they've ever experienced.
*  They can begin days, even weeks, before death.
*  Most significant, as people near the end of their lives, the frequency of visions increases,
*  further centering on deceased people or pets.
*  It is these final visions that provide patients and their loved ones with profound meaning and solace.
*  Kerr's latest research is focused on the emotional transformation he has often observed
*  in patients who experience such visions.
*  The first in this series of studies, published in 2019, measured psychological and spiritual
*  growth among two groups of hospice patients.
*  Those who had visions and a control group of those who did not.
*  Patients rated their agreement with statements including,
*  I changed my priorities about what is important in life, or
*  I have a better understanding of spiritual matters.
*  Those who experienced end-of-life visions agreed more strongly with those statements,
*  suggesting that the visions sparked inner change, even at the end of life.
*  It's the most remarkable of our studies, Kerr told me.
*  It highlights the paradox of dying, that while there is physical deterioration,
*  they are growing and finding meaning.
*  It highlights what patients are telling us, that they are being put back together.
*  In the many conversations Kerr and I have had over the past year, the contradiction
*  between medicine's demand for evidence and the ineffable quality of his patients'
*  experiences came up repeatedly.
*  He was first struck by this tension about a year before the publication of his first
*  study, during a visit with a World War II veteran named John, who was tormented throughout
*  his life by nightmares that took him back to the beaches of Normandy on D-Day.
*  John had been part of a rescue mission to bring wounded soldiers to England by ship
*  and leave those too far gone to die.
*  The nightmares continued through his dying days,
*  until he dreamed of being discharged from the army.
*  In a second dream, a fallen soldier appeared to John to tell him that his
*  comrades would soon come to get him.
*  The nightmares ended after that.
*  Kerr has been nagged ever since by the inadequacy of science and of language to fully capture
*  the mysteries of the mind.
*  We were so caught up in trying to quantify and give structure to something so deeply
*  spiritual and really we were just bystanders, witnesses to this, he says.
*  It feels a little small to be filling in forms when you're looking at a 90-something-year-old
*  veteran who is back in time 70 years having an experience you can't even understand.
*  When Kerr talks about his research at conferences, nurses tend to nod their heads in approval.
*  Doctors roll their eyes in disbelief.
*  He finds that skeptics often understand the research best when they watch taped interviews
*  with patients.
*  What's striking about this footage, which dates back to Kerr's early work in 2008,
*  is not so much the content of the visions, but rather the patient's demeanor.
*  There's an absence of fear, Kerr says.
*  A teenage girl's face lights up as she describes a dream in which she and her deceased aunt
*  were in a castle playing with Barbie dolls.
*  A man dying of cancer talks about his wife, who died several years earlier, and who comes
*  to him in his dreams, always in blue.
*  She waves, she smiles.
*  That's it.
*  But in the moment, he seems to be transported to another time or place.
*  Kerr has often observed that in the very end, dying people lose interest in the activities
*  that preoccupied them in life and turn toward those they love.
*  As to why, Kerr can only speculate.
*  In his 2020 book, Death is But a Dream, he concludes that the love his patients find
*  in dying often brings them to a place that some call enlightenment and others call God.
*  Time seems to vanish, he told me.
*  The people who loved you well, secured you, and contributed to who you are are still accessible
*  at a spiritual and psychological level.
*  That was the case with Connor O'Neill, who died at the age of 10 in 2022, and whose parents,
*  Kerr and I, visited in their home.
*  They told us that just two days before his death, their son called out the name of a
*  family friend who, without the boy's knowledge, had just died.
*  Do you know where you are?
*  Connor's mother asked.
*  Heaven, the boy replied.
*  Connor had barely spoken in days or moved without help.
*  But in that moment, he sat up under his own strength and threw his arms around her neck.
*  Mommy, I love you, he said.
*  Kerr's research finds that such moments, which transcend the often painful physical
*  decline in the last days of life, help parents like the O'Neills and other relatives grieve
*  even unfathomable loss.
*  I don't know where I would be without that closure or that gift that was given to us,
*  Connor's father told us.
*  It's hard enough with it.
*  As Kerr explains, it's the difference between being wounded and soothed.
*  In June, I visited the adult daughter of a patient who died at home just days earlier.
*  We sat in her mother's living room, looking out on the patio and bird feeders that had
*  given the mother so much joy.
*  Three days before her mother's death, the daughter was straightening up the room when
*  her mother began to speak more lucidly than she had in days.
*  The daughter crawled into her mother's bed, held her hand, and listened.
*  Her mother first spoke to the daughter's father, whom she could see in the far corner
*  of the room, handsome as ever.
*  She then started speaking with her second husband, visible only to her, yet real enough
*  for the daughter to ask whether he was smoking his pipe.
*  Can't you smell it?
*  Her mother replied.
*  Even in the retelling, the moment felt sacred.
*  I will never, ever forget it, the daughter told me.
*  It was so beautiful.
*  I also met one of Banus' patients, Peggy Holoski, who had enrolled in hospice for home
*  care services just days earlier, after doctors at the cancer hospital in Buffalo found blood
*  clots throughout her body, a sign that the year-long treatment had stopped working.
*  It was time for her husband, Stephen, to keep her comfortable at home with their two greyhounds.
*  Stephen led Banus and me to the family room, where Peggy lay on the couch.
*  Banus knelt on the floor, checked her patient's catheter, reduced her prescriptions so there
*  were fewer pills for her to swallow every day, and ordered a numbing cream for pain
*  in her tailbone.
*  She also asked about her visions.
*  The nurse on call that weekend witnessed Peggy speaking with her dead mother.
*  She was standing over here, Peggy told Banus, gesturing toward the corner of the room.
*  Was that the only time you saw her?
*  Banus asked.
*  So far.
*  Do you think you'll be seeing her more?
*  I will.
*  I will, considering what's going on.
*  Peggy sank deeper into the couch and closed her eyes, recounting another visit from the
*  dead, this time by the first greyhound she and Stephen adopted.
*  I'm at peace with everybody.
*  I'm happy, she said.
*  It's not time yet.
*  I know it's not time, but it's coming.
*  When my mother, Chloe Zerwick, was dying in 2018, I had never heard of end-of-life visions.
*  I was acting on intuition when her caregiver started telling me about what we were then
*  calling hallucinations.
*  Mom was 95 and living in her Hudson Valley home under hospice care, with lung disease
*  and congestive heart failure, barely able to leave her bed.
*  The hospice doctor prescribed an opioid for pain and put her on antipsychotic and anti-anxiety
*  medicines to tame the so-called hallucinations he worried were preventing her from sleeping.
*  It is possible that some of these medications caused mom's visions.
*  But as Kerr has explained, drug-induced hallucinations do not rule out naturally occurring visions.
*  They can coexist.
*  In my mother's case, I inherently understood that her imaginary life was something to honor.
*  I knew what medicine-induced hallucinations looked and felt like.
*  About 10 years before her death, mom fell and injured her spine.
*  Doctors in the local hospital put her on an opioid to control the pain, which left her
*  acting like a different person.
*  There were spiders crawling on the hospital wall, she said.
*  She mistook her roommate's bed for a train platform.
*  Worse, she denied that I loved her or ever did.
*  Once we took her off the medicine, the hallucinations vanished.
*  The visions she was having at the end of her life were entirely different.
*  They were connected to the long life she had led and brought a deep sense of comfort and delight.
*  You know, for the first time in my life, I have no worries, she told me.
*  I remember feeling a weight lift.
*  After more than a decade of failing health, she seemed to have found a sense of peace.
*  The day before her death, as her breathing became more labored, mom made an announcement.
*  I have a new leader, she said.
*  Who is that, I asked.
*  Mark, he's going to take me to the other side.
*  She was speaking of my husband, alive and well, back home in North Carolina.
*  That's great, mom, except that I need him here with me, I replied.
*  Do you think he can do both?
*  Oh yes, he's very capable.
*  That evening, mom was struggling again to breathe.
*  I'm thinking of the next world, she said, and of my husband, who would lead her there.
*  The caregiver on duty for the night and I sat at her bedside as mom's oxygen level
*  fell from 68 to 63 to 52, and kept dropping until she died the next morning.
*  My mother was not a brave person in the traditional sense of the word.
*  She was afraid of snakes, the subway platform, and any hint of pain.
*  But she faced her death confident that a man who loves her daughter would guide her to
*  whatever lay ahead.
*  Do you think it will happen to you?
*  She asked me at one point about her dreaming life.
*  Maybe it's genetic, I replied, not knowing, as I do now, that these experiences are part
*  of what may await us all.
