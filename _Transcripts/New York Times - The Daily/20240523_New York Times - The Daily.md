# The World’s Court vs. Israel’s Leaders
**New York Times Podcasts:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrb5-UiKQrU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Earlier this week, the top prosecutor of the International Criminal Court requested arrest
*  warrants for Israel's prime minister and its defense minister.
*  The move shocked Israelis and set up a possible showdown between the world's top criminal
*  court and Israel, together with its biggest ally, the United States.
*  Today, my colleague, Jerusalem bureau chief Patrick Kingsley, explains.
*  It's Thursday, May 23rd.
*  So Patrick, earlier this week, there was a pretty surprising announcement by the International
*  Criminal Court in The Hague.
*  It had to do with Israel and Hamas.
*  Tell us what happened.
*  Well, on Monday morning, we were all taken by surprise by an announcement from the chief
*  prosecutor at the ICC, the International Criminal Court, the top criminal court in the world.
*  It tries individuals accused of war crimes, and the chief prosecutor announced that he
*  was requesting arrest warrants for five individuals involved in the war between Israel and Hamas
*  for crimes against humanity.
*  Three of them were from Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas within Gaza, the Hamas military
*  commander and the political leader of Hamas, who's based in Qatar.
*  But maybe the biggest news in this announcement was that the chief prosecutor was seeking
*  the arrest of two of Israel's top leaders, Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and
*  Yoav Galant, the defense minister.
*  And this was a massive bombshell.
*  These two men are leaders from a major US ally.
*  They're in regular contact with the US government.
*  And they were being implicitly equated with the three top leaders of an organization,
*  Hamas, that many consider a terrorist organization.
*  And this equation sent shockwaves through Israeli society and indeed around the world.
*  So this is absolutely remarkable, Patrick.
*  I, for one, was quite surprised by seeing this.
*  I want to dig into it with you.
*  So who is this prosecutor behind these requests for these warrants?
*  And how did he reach this decision to go for them in the first place?
*  So the prosecutor's name is Kareem Khan, and he is a British lawyer, a British barrister.
*  He is 54.
*  He's led a very impressive career.
*  He has spent years working on human rights cases, both defending people and also prosecuting
*  in such cases.
*  He was involved in tribunals related to the wars surrounding the breakup of the former
*  Yugoslavia, Rwanda.
*  He investigated Islamic state crimes in Iraq.
*  And in 2021, he is appointed the top prosecutor at the ICC.
*  And what are his responsibilities as top prosecutor?
*  Well, it's his job to travel the world and investigate allegations of human rights abuses,
*  war crimes, crimes against humanity, and in the process plays a key role in deciding who
*  gets prosecuted at the International Criminal Court.
*  The ICC and the ICC prosecutor investigates and tries people who would not be pursued
*  by the judicial system within their countries of origin.
*  It steps in when it seems like the domestic authorities in any given country are not doing
*  their job.
*  And last year, he famously went after President Putin in Russia in connection with the war
*  in Ukraine.
*  So at what point did this prosecutor, Kareem Khan, turn his attention to Israel and Gaza?
*  Well, he actually inherits an investigation from his predecessor that's looking at Israel's
*  conduct and also that of Hamas during a previous war in 2014 between the two sides.
*  But then that gets superseded on October 7th by the horrors that we saw that day committed
*  by Hamas and then by the scale and damage caused by Israel's bombing campaign in its
*  counterattack.
*  And we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what Hamas had done in early October,
*  but also growing criticism and condemnation of what Israel and its air force did in its
*  response.
*  You'll remember that earlier this year, the International Court of Justice, a separate
*  court also in The Hague began to address claims that Israel was and is committing a genocide
*  in Gaza, a claim that Israel strongly denies.
*  Right.
*  That was the case that South Africa brought.
*  We did an episode about that.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  So as the world's attention focuses on this new conflict, so does Kareem Khan's.
*  Also today, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Kareem Khan QC, has wrapped
*  up a visit to Israel and the Occupied West Bank.
*  Khan has visited the region to investigate if war crimes were committed.
*  We start to see him arrive in Israel, visiting some of the sites that Hamas attacked last
*  year, talking to survivors, talking to leaders, reviewing security camera footage and so on.
*  I've just come from the border of the Rafah crossing and we could see Gaza.
*  At least we could see cranes that were on the territory of Gaza.
*  He also visited the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza, talks to Palestinians.
*  At the Ministry of Justice in Ramallah, the chief prosecutor of the world's highest court,
*  he goes to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to Ramallah, where the Palestinian Authority
*  is based, building up evidence that led to this announcement on Monday.
*  Today I'm filing applications for warrants of arrest before pre-trial chamber one of
*  the International Criminal Court.
*  And he makes this very dramatic announcement in a video.
*  My office has diligently collected evidence and interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses
*  at the scene of at least six major attack locations.
*  Flanked on each side by two of his deputies.
*  I have reasonable grounds to believe that three senior leaders of Hamas, Yahya Sinwa,
*  Mohammad Daif and Ismail Haniya, bear criminal responsibility for the following international
*  crimes.
*  The accusations that he makes against the three Hamas leaders focus on the violent actions
*  that Hamas took on October 7th.
*  Extermination as a crime against humanity.
*  Murder as a crime against humanity.
*  And he walked through a long list of charges stemming from the extraordinary violence during
*  that attack.
*  The taking of hostages as a war crime.
*  Rape and other acts of sexual violence during captivity.
*  And he says there are reasonable grounds to believe that hostages taken from Israel have
*  been subject to sexual violence, including rape, while being held in captivity.
*  And he cites assessment of medical records, video and documentary evidence as well as
*  interviews with victims and survivors.
*  And I repeat and underline my call for the immediate release of all hostages taken from
*  Israel and for their immediate safe return to their families.
*  So this prosecutor sees the atrocities on October 7th and then what followed with Hamas
*  taking the hostages, abusing them as crimes against humanity.
*  That's what it amounted to in his view.
*  Exactly.
*  And what about the charges against the Israelis?
*  These are slightly different.
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Galant bear criminal
*  responsibility for the following international crimes.
*  Obviously a lot of the outcry and horror at the war in Gaza has centered around Israel's
*  airstrikes that have killed tens of thousands of Gazans.
*  But Kareem Khan focuses not on the military actions of Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Galant,
*  his defense minister, but on the accusation of starvation of civilians as a method of
*  warfare, starvation, the idea that Israel has allegedly sought to restrict and block
*  aid deliveries, food supplies to Gaza with the intent to starve the civilian population there.
*  These individuals, through a common plan, have systematically deprived the civilian
*  population of Gaza of objects indispensable to human survival.
*  And that's primarily based on the fact that for the first two weeks of the war, until
*  October 21st or so, Israel blocked all aid entry to Gaza.
*  After Yoav Galant, the defense minister, one of these two Israelis whose arrests Mr. Khan
*  seeks said that he was imposing a total siege on Gaza.
*  No food, no fuel, no electricity.
*  And while that total siege was eased towards the end of October, Khan also notes that there
*  have been continuing restrictions on essential supplies like food and medicine ever since.
*  That conduct took place alongside attacks that killed civilians, the obstruction of
*  aid delivery by humanitarian organizations, and attacks on aid workers that forced many
*  of those same humanitarian organizations to either cease operations or limit their life-saving
*  efforts in Gaza.
*  The implication is that the famine that he says is present in some areas of Gaza and
*  imminent in other areas is in part the responsibility of Netanyahu and Galant.
*  That starvation has caused and continues to cause deaths, malnutrition, dehydration, and
*  profound suffering among the population.
*  My office charges Netanyahu and Galant as co-perpetrators and as superiors in the commission
*  of these alleged crimes.
*  Why is the focus of these charges starvation?
*  I mean, given that the airstrikes, as you say, were in many ways really the focus of
*  this war and certainly the focus of the world's attention on this war, the civilian deaths
*  from the military operation, why starvation?
*  Karim Khan does not explain why he focuses on starvation rather than Israel's military
*  tactics, which he mentions only in passing.
*  But legal experts have said that it's easier to prove that starvation was used as a method
*  of warfare than it is to prove that there have been any specific crimes involved in
*  any specific airstrikes.
*  And that's because under the rules of war and international law, it's not necessarily
*  illegal in and of itself to kill civilians during wartime.
*  If a military assesses with the help of military lawyers that the likely civilian death toll
*  caused by that strike is proportional to the value of the military target, then that in
*  many cases will be in accordance with the rules of war.
*  If a military can prove that sense of proportionality, then it's actually quite hard to prove that
*  there was any crime committed in the process.
*  So in other words, military actions are often weighed quite carefully.
*  In the case of, say, a modern military like Israel's or the United States, there are lawyers
*  that look at these things.
*  It's not necessarily so easy to prove that something was disproportionate and should
*  be considered a crime.
*  Exactly.
*  Whereas with the crime of starvation, legal experts say that it's potentially easier to
*  prove that there was some wrongdoing there because Yoav Galand, the Israeli defense minister,
*  went on record in a public statement and he announced that there would be a total siege
*  on the territory of Gaza.
*  And that was followed by an action, the action of closing off Gaza's borders for the next
*  two weeks.
*  And no aid was allowed in during that time.
*  There were restrictions on electricity, water, fuel, as well as food.
*  And that's why legal experts think that Karim Khan has gone after Israel with the crime
*  of starvation rather than focusing on their military operations.
*  But I suppose just thinking about our coverage, Patrick, and the conversations you and I have
*  had, famine and starvation and a civilian population in extreme distress trapped in
*  a small piece of territory is also not a small thing, right?
*  That is also something that makes sense that the court would be considering.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's a huge thing.
*  People don't have to be hit by an airstrike to be living through an absolutely catastrophic
*  situation.
*  So these charges really seem to spell bad news for Israel and for these two Israeli
*  leaders Netanyahu and Galand.
*  And it's remarkable because these are men who, as you say, are some of America's closest
*  allies.
*  I mean, they're at the Pentagon.
*  They're having meetings with President Biden.
*  Now the chief prosecutor of the ICC is saying that they are war criminals.
*  Yes, it is a very dramatic moment in the view of some people at turning point.
*  And certainly we can say that it is one of the harshest rebukes of Israel's wartime conduct
*  since October 7th.
*  Within Israel, there's been a very different reaction.
*  And it's not all bad news for Benjamin Netanyahu.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Patrick, what do Israelis make of this announcement?
*  In Israel, the reaction has been very different.
*  Whether it's Netanyahu's allies or his critics, there has been almost uniform outrage that
*  the prosecutor for the ICC would make these accusations.
*  And it means that at a time of rising domestic criticism of Prime Minister Netanyahu, across
*  the political spectrum, with only a very few exceptions, everyone has rallied behind Netanyahu
*  and Gallant.
*  Despite the fact that Netanyahu is increasingly unpopular and even within his own government,
*  there have been growing criticism of his wartime strategy.
*  For example, just two days before the prosecutor's announcement, one of the senior members of
*  his own wartime cabinet, Benny Gantz, issued Netanyahu with an ultimatum warning him that
*  he would quit the government if he did not spell out a plan for a post-war Gaza.
*  Then suddenly the announcement comes from Kareem Khan that Netanyahu and Gallant are
*  under investigation.
*  And Gantz is one of the first to come out with a condemnation of Kareem Khan in the
*  defense of the Israeli government.
*  That is the clearest example of how even critics of Netanyahu have fallen in line, circled
*  the wagons and presented a united front.
*  This is really interesting.
*  So this action by the prosecutor has kind of had the effect of actually closing divisions
*  that were starting to appear in Israeli society, effectively bringing Netanyahu's critics
*  kind of back into his camp, or at least making it harder to criticize him.
*  Exactly.
*  Israelis in general feel that Israel has always been targeted unfairly, held to a higher
*  standard than many other countries.
*  And that this is, once again, another example of that, another example of Israel being accused
*  of things that other countries do but get away with.
*  And there have been broadly three criticisms from the Israelis of the ICC prosecutor.
*  First, the Israeli claim is that the ICC prosecutor is making a horrible false equivalence between
*  Hamas, a terrorist organization, and Israel, a democratic state.
*  Hamas raided Israel and launched the bloodiest attack on Jews in a single day since the Holocaust.
*  Israel in the eyes of Israelis is fighting a righteous response to protect their citizens
*  and to win back the liberty of the hostages that were captured on October 7th.
*  This guy is out to demonize Israel.
*  He's doing a hit job.
*  And Netanyahu himself articulated some of the clearest versions of this argument when
*  he went on American television.
*  He's creating false symmetry, false facts, and he's doing a grave injustice to the international court.
*  And he called Khan's decision absurd, an effort to demonize Israel and to hold it to far higher
*  standards than any other country.
*  He said it would have been as if after 9-11...
*  That's like saying after 9-11, well, I'm issuing arrest warrants for George Bush but also for Bin Laden.
*  Arrest warrants had been issued for both Osama Bin Laden and George Bush.
*  Or after in World War II, well, I'm issuing arrest warrants for FDR but also for Hitler.
*  It's a hit job.
*  It's not serious.
*  He's out to defame Israel.
*  The second criticism from Israelis has been about process.
*  The ICC was created about two decades ago by a treaty.
*  More than 120 countries have signed that treaty.
*  But Israel has not.
*  And Israel contends that the prosecutor doesn't have the authority, therefore, to go after
*  Israeli political leaders.
*  Israelis also say that Khan didn't spend enough time assessing whether Israel was itself investigating
*  these allegations within its own judicial system.
*  Remember that the ICC is a court of last resort.
*  It's only supposed to intervene when a domestic judicial system is generally not making any
*  effort to investigate an alleged crime.
*  And Israelis are saying that Khan didn't spend enough time investigating Galen and Netanyahu.
*  The ICC prosecutors have spent 10 years investigating alleged crimes committed during a previous
*  war between Israel and Hamas.
*  This decision has been issued within just a few months.
*  And Israelis are saying that Khan jumped the gun in that sense.
*  So the Israelis are saying, look, we're trying to get to it, but you just didn't give us
*  enough time.
*  Exactly.
*  And they've even said that Khan's team was supposed to be coming this very week to continue
*  that conversation and assess whether Israel was genuinely looking into these allegations
*  by itself.
*  And that they misled Israel by pretending that they would be making that assessment
*  when in fact all along they were planning to request arrest warrants.
*  Interesting.
*  So for Israeli officials, they're seeing it as a kind of activist thing as opposed to
*  a neutral judicial decision.
*  That's their claim at least.
*  The prosecutor's office says that they have tried to sincerely engage with Israel on this
*  issue, but that it's become clear to them that Israel does not seriously investigate
*  this kind of crime.
*  So you said there are three elements to this.
*  What's the last?
*  The third and last element is on the content of the claim itself.
*  Israel flatly denies that it is responsible for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
*  It even denies that there is a famine or that the situation is on the point of a famine.
*  It points out all the ways in which it has worked to get much more aid into Gaza since
*  October, including opening more crossings, allowing the U.S. to create a pier on the
*  shoreline of Gaza.
*  It's allowed some countries to airdrop aid.
*  And certainly the amount of aid that has gone in in recent months has dwarfed the amount
*  that was going in in October and November.
*  While it accepts that its soldiers have obstructed and at times even killed aid workers, it says
*  that that obscures the fact that it coordinates every day in detail with aid groups to facilitate
*  thousands of aid missions every month.
*  Isn't Israel's argument that these shipments could also include things that could be very
*  useful for Hamas, the group that just killed 1,200 of its citizens?
*  Exactly.
*  It seems disputing, least of all Israel, that Israeli officials are examining all the aid
*  going into Gaza.
*  The dispute is about whether that's necessary.
*  Israel says it is.
*  It says that if it didn't check, then some of these aid convoys might be smuggling in
*  weapons or material that could be used to fight Israel, to kill Israeli civilians, and
*  that therefore Israel has no choice but to examine some of these goods going in.
*  Again, the counter argument is that Israel's checks are far more stringent than they need
*  to be and end up preventing the entry of everyday items that pose no military threat.
*  Okay, so that's the Israeli perspective.
*  How does the United States see the prosecutor's request here?
*  I mean, the U.S., obviously, Israel's biggest ally.
*  Well, the American president, President Biden, condemned it in no uncertain terms.
*  He said the prosecutor's decision was outrageous and he condemned him for drawing an implicit
*  equivalence between Hamas and the leaders of the state of Israel.
*  And why did Biden come out so strongly against the prosecutor?
*  We know that humanitarian aid has been a major concern for this administration.
*  So why would Biden be so opposed to something that really is calling out Israel for this aid?
*  First of all, because Israel is a major ally of the United States and the United States
*  wants to show support for its ally.
*  Second of all, they fear that this kind of criticism, this kind of intervention will
*  actually make Israel less rather than more likely to bring the war to a halt because
*  the feeling is that it will make Israel more defensive and in turn batten down the hatches.
*  The third reason is that the United States historically has never been a particular fan
*  of the International Criminal Court.
*  We mentioned earlier that Israel did not sign the treaty that created the ICC.
*  Well, the United States did not do that either.
*  And that's in part because American leaders fear that having an international global court
*  undermines American sovereignty.
*  They think it's the role of the American judicial system to investigate American citizens.
*  And there is a fear that with the United States so active militarily in many parts of the
*  world, that membership of the court, involvement in the court could pave the way for American
*  soldiers being tried for acting on behalf of the United States.
*  And that could somehow dent American foreign policy goals across the world.
*  Okay, so the United States doesn't really like this court, you know, has troops in a
*  lot of places, doesn't want a court swooping in and prosecuting them when something goes
*  wrong.
*  But I guess the question then in my mind, Patrick, is does what this prosecutor is doing
*  matter?
*  I mean, America is not a signatory.
*  Israel is not a signatory.
*  So why is this important?
*  Well, for the time being, its meaning is more symbolic than anything else.
*  First, Kareem Khan has not issued an arrest warrant.
*  He has requested an arrest warrant for these five people.
*  And three judges will now spend weeks and possibly months deciding whether to uphold
*  those requests.
*  That process can be less than a month.
*  In the case of Vladimir Putin, it was just shy of a month.
*  Bashir of Sudan was issued with a warrant.
*  The process took roughly a year.
*  When and if they do do that, however, there will be practical effects.
*  If an arrest warrant is issued, it means that any country that's a member of the International
*  Criminal Court, in theory, should arrest any of these individuals if they enter their territory.
*  That includes more than 120 countries all over the world.
*  So there are countries like Russia, Europe, Latin America, Africa, and so on.
*  Yes, it's true that the United States and Israel are not signatories.
*  And neither are Turkey or Qatar, two of the countries where Hamas officials spend much
*  of their time when they're outside Gaza.
*  So there will still be places for officials on either side of these accusations to travel
*  to.
*  But there are lots of other countries like France, Italy, both places where Benjamin
*  Netanyahu traveled in the past year, where in theory, they will not be able to set foot.
*  So the negotiations over the war can still continue.
*  But if Netanyahu travels to France or to Italy, he could be arrested, which is pretty wild.
*  Yes, at least that's the theory.
*  The national authorities in any given country still have to make a choice about whether
*  they want to follow through with it.
*  But would those countries perhaps not arrest him out of deference to the United States?
*  I think the expectation is that if we got into this scenario, then someone like Netanyahu
*  simply just wouldn't travel to such a country.
*  But the truth is, we just don't really know.
*  We are entering uncharted waters.
*  So this is really isolating Netanyahu in the world, should it go forward?
*  Yes, isolating Netanyahu and to some extent, Israel itself.
*  It has not just practical implications for the physical movement of Netanyahu and his
*  defense ministry gallant, but it also compounds Israel's relationship with foreign allies.
*  It complicates Israel's ability to arm itself.
*  More countries may grow more unwilling to sell Israel arms, or at least they'll face
*  growing pressure because of this decision not to do so.
*  It also could force the country to become ever more reliant on the United States as
*  it becomes more of a pariah over its actions in Gaza.
*  Which of course puts the United States in an even trickier position with an ally who's
*  been pretty hard to be friends with of late.
*  Right.
*  And in truth, while the practical consequences of this move are still unknown, they do in
*  general compound the sense that Israel is facing more and more diplomatic consequences
*  for its actions.
*  More than a decade ago, a former Israeli prime minister warned that Israel would face what
*  he called a diplomatic tsunami if its conflict with the Palestinians went unresolved.
*  It's possible that years later we're starting to finally see what he meant.
*  Israel does still have its supporters, many of them, but we're also now seeing during
*  this war a level of criticism that goes above and beyond the kind that we've grown used
*  to seeing directed at Israel over the years.
*  In addition to the warrant requests we've seen this week, we've obviously had an extraordinary
*  wave of protests on American campuses and elsewhere in the world.
*  And earlier this year, we had a watershed moment when the International Court of Justice
*  began hearing accusations of genocide against Israel.
*  And this week, several European countries recognized Palestine as a state.
*  Wow.
*  If the tsunami hasn't yet arrived, we can at least say that the waves are getting stronger.
*  Patrick, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  On Wednesday, the leaders of Spain, Norway and Ireland announced that they would recognize
*  an independent Palestinian state.
*  The move was largely symbolic, but raised the concern that if neighboring countries
*  followed their lead, Europe could become a counterweight to the American position that
*  statehood for Palestinians should come only from a negotiated settlement with Israel.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Nikki Haley, the former United Nations ambassador who dropped her Republican presidential bid
*  in March, said on Wednesday that she would vote for Donald Trump, but stopped short of
*  officially endorsing him.
*  Haley was Trump's longest standing rival in the 2024 primary contest and had carved
*  out an important lane for herself as the voice for voters looking for an alternative to the
*  former president.
*  Her decision on whether to endorse him could play a pivotal role in the race.
*  Haley has built a formidable network of high dollar donors and a solid base of college
*  educated voters that Trump needs to win.
*  And the city of Uvalde, Texas has reached a settlement with most of the families of
*  children who were shot by a gunman at Robb Elementary School in 2022.
*  To avert a lawsuit, the city promised to overhaul the city's police force, create a permanent
*  memorial to the victims and pay $2 million.
