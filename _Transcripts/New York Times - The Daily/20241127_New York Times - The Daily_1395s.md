# How Israel Uses Palestinian Detainees as Human Shields
**New York Times Podcasts:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_CoegM35aw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily.
*  Overnight, Israel agreed to a ceasefire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, a major
*  turning point in one of the wars Israel has been fighting since Hamas attacked it on October
*  7.
*  But the war in Gaza shows no signs of ending.
*  With Israel coming under increased scrutiny for the way it is conducting it.
*  Today, a Times investigation into one controversial tactic.
*  The Israeli use of Palestinian detainees as human shields.
*  And what it reveals about the nature of the conflict.
*  My colleague Natan Odenheimer explains.
*  It's Wednesday, November 27.
*  So Natan, a lot has been happening with Israel in the past few days.
*  We had the ceasefire with Lebanon and Hezbollah on Tuesday night.
*  And the week before, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Golan.
*  They issued those warrants for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.
*  You Natan have been investigating another practice by the Israeli military, one that's
*  unconnected to what happened in the court, but seems to also raise questions about the
*  rules of war.
*  And that is Israel's use of Palestinians as human shields.
*  Tell me exactly what you found.
*  So actually, I stumbled into this story around January 2024.
*  I was filling my water bottle at the gym when I heard someone who I quickly understood was
*  an Israeli soldier who recently returned from Gaza, talking about seeing Palestinians being
*  sent into Hamas tunnels.
*  That what he was explaining is that the military is using Palestinians as human shields, sending
*  them into Hamas tunnels ahead of Israeli forces to probe those dangerous areas.
*  So in other words, this is an Israeli soldier you're overhearing.
*  The guy just came back from Gaza and he's recounting how they used Palestinians as human
*  shields in Gaza.
*  Precisely.
*  And I immediately wanted to know more.
*  If true, if they were using Palestinians in this way in combat, this would be very, very
*  wrong and illegal under both Israeli and international law.
*  So I injected myself into the conversation, challenged him a bit to see how insistent
*  he is.
*  He stood behind the story and I went back home that day knowing that I have to get to
*  the bottom of this to understand if this is something that only happens in one or two
*  places and is very local or is this something that is actually a widespread phenomena across
*  the military?
*  So what did you do next?
*  How did your reporting take shape?
*  Well, so I had one lead, right?
*  I was able to get his number and I called him up a few days later, introduced myself
*  as a journalist, said that I'm interested to hearing more of his thoughts about how
*  the war is being fought.
*  And when we got to this topic again, he showed a few more details telling me more or less
*  where it took place.
*  But at some point he closed in and said that he'd want to stop the conversation there.
*  He said that he's not very willing to talk about this anymore.
*  So basically he went dark before you could actually understand exactly what this phenomenon
*  was.
*  Right.
*  And we had a lot of questions.
*  We wanted to know how widespread it is, who are those Palestinians and mainly who authorized
*  this?
*  And slowly, slowly we were able to find more people.
*  Some of them came forward because they thought that it's very disturbing.
*  Others we just kept on asking those questions and we were able to piece together a full
*  picture.
*  And what did that picture show?
*  So over a course of about 10 months of investigation, we, Bilal Shabir, my colleague in Gaza, and
*  Patrick Kinkley, the Jerusalem bureau chief of the New York Times, were able to uncover
*  a disturbing practice of the Israeli military in Gaza.
*  The Israeli military was using Palestinians as human shields in Gaza.
*  They were using them to probe Hamas tunnels and they sent them ahead of forces into homes
*  that they were afraid were booby trapped by Hamas.
*  In some cases, Palestinian detainees were dressed as IDF soldiers and in others, they
*  were given body cameras to take with them to give live feed to Israeli soldiers.
*  Why use Palestinians for this?
*  Why do this at all for that matter?
*  Israel has an incredibly sophisticated military and presumably the technology to do this kind
*  of work.
*  Right.
*  So there are different reasons.
*  So first off, as great as drones and robots and even canine dogs can probe tunnels, a
*  human being that can walk and move objects is way more efficient in probing areas.
*  Sometimes a person can do tasks that a drone and a robot can't really do.
*  And the other thing is that after three months of war, a canine dog is not as efficient as
*  it was in the past.
*  They're too traumatized and they're confused from all the smell of the explosives around.
*  So they lose their orientation.
*  So whenever sniffer dogs, robots or drones weren't good enough to probe the tunnels or
*  walk ahead of forces into homes, they started using Palestinian prisoners as human shields
*  for dangerous tasks.
*  So the Israeli military is using people, Palestinian detainees, to do this very dangerous job.
*  That even dogs at this point can't do.
*  Were you able to talk to anyone who this actually happened to?
*  Yes.
*  So our reporter in Gaza, Bilal Shabir, spoke with three Palestinians who spoke on the record
*  about their experience as being used as human shields.
*  One of them was a pharmacist named Bashir El-Dalu.
*  He's a 43 year old father of four from northern Gaza.
*  In the beginning of the war, he and his family fled south.
*  And then around mid-November, he decided that he wants to make a risky trip back to his
*  home to get some essentials, some things that his family really needed.
*  At that point, the Israeli military considered any Palestinian walking around these unpopulated
*  areas as a potential Hamas operative.
*  I see.
*  Because this was after the Israelis had told everybody to evacuate.
*  So anybody still there was suspect.
*  Right.
*  So after Bashir got to his home, the Israeli military detained him.
*  And by his account, they ordered him at gunpoint to undress and they blindfolded him.
*  They took him barefoot and almost completely naked to a nearby yard of a multi-story building.
*  And then they took off the blindfold, made sure that his hands are tied in front of him
*  and not in the back so he would be able to move objects, and told him to go ahead of
*  forces and probe that area.
*  And this yard, according to his account, was partly ruined.
*  There were glass all over the floor.
*  And as he was walking, he was injured by this glass.
*  Because his feet were bare.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  His feet were bare.
*  And the soldiers were staying behind, giving him directions from a megaphone.
*  So they ordered him to move around the yard, looking into different places, places they
*  thought were potentially booby-trapped or an entrance to a tunnel.
*  And then there was noise coming out from around an electricity generator.
*  And the soldiers got really afraid and started shooting in that direction.
*  But it turned out that it was a kithid that made all this noise.
*  And he said that some of the soldiers laughed in relief.
*  Wow.
*  Was he hurt?
*  He wasn't hurt from the shooting, but he was injured from walking barefoot on the glass.
*  So they used him as a human shield in several instances, but eventually they decided to
*  take him into Israel and send him to an Israeli detention center.
*  And I think that one of the things that really sent chills into my arms when I heard this
*  is that he said that he was excited, happy, and relieved to get there, knowing that he's
*  outside of this dangerous zone.
*  Wow.
*  So that actually shows you how frightening that was for him, that he felt better once
*  he got to the Israeli detention center, not generally the kind of place that a Gazan would
*  tend to feel very safe in.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that it's also important to mention that he was treated there for his injuries,
*  but also released later on, sent back to Gaza, which tells us that the Israeli intelligence
*  did not think that he was involved with any militant group.
*  Right.
*  That he was essentially just a civilian.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And what we later found out is that El Dalo's experience wasn't that rare.
*  The Israeli military used Palestinians as human shields again and again throughout the war.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So, Natan, you said that you eventually came to understand that the story of Bashir, the
*  pharmacist, was actually not that rare.
*  But what was the actual scope of this?
*  What was the scale?
*  So it's very difficult to understand the scale, but we spoke to 16 Israeli defense officials
*  and soldiers.
*  Some of them participated in this practice, and most of them describe it as a rather routine
*  practice.
*  And it seemed to us that this practice became more and more widespread throughout the war.
*  And one of the reasons that made us understand that is that we went to some people in, say,
*  April or March and asked them if they know anything about it.
*  And they gave us a hard no.
*  They said, you know, this is not something that they would imagine people would be doing.
*  But then again, when we circled back in June or July, suddenly they said that they came
*  across it and even saw it with their own eyes.
*  So the practice seemed to have gotten much more widespread as the war went on.
*  Exactly, Sabrina.
*  And we were able to confirm that this took place in at least 11 different squads throughout
*  the Gaza Strip.
*  So from the north to the south in five Palestinian cities.
*  And what really gave us a clear idea that this is quite commonplace practice was that
*  it had a term.
*  So the practice was broad enough throughout the military that it had a name and, you know,
*  people knew it.
*  That implies scope.
*  That's right.
*  So the first time we heard these terms was in February.
*  A soldier who came back from the battlefields told us that already in November, he heard
*  a senior commander explain to his deputy that a nearby unit is asking for either a mosquito
*  or a wasp.
*  And what does he mean there?
*  I mean, mosquito and wasp.
*  So luckily for us, the deputy didn't know either.
*  And the more senior commander explained to him that a mosquito is a Palestinian who was
*  detained nearby in Gaza and was then being used as a human shield in tunnels or in other
*  dangerous places.
*  As for wasps, we got varying accounts from sources.
*  What we do know is that a wasp is someone who was in Israel and was brought into Gaza
*  by Israeli intelligence officers for brief and specific missions.
*  And there was some disagreement about whether these were detainees or whether these were
*  paid collaborators who volunteered to enter Gaza with the military.
*  OK, so in other words, mosquitoes are kind of like Bashir, the pharmacist.
*  They maybe got swept up in something inside Gaza, but wasps were different.
*  They were brought from Israel back to Gaza and used there.
*  But why would that happen?
*  What is the purpose of moving them?
*  Seems quite complicated to do.
*  So what I understood from several of the soldiers is that these are sometimes Palestinians who
*  have knowledge of the tunnels or other places.
*  Sometimes they were being used as human shields going into those tunnels ahead of the forces,
*  but they were also used for intelligence and sometimes to point to places where they told
*  the Israeli military could potentially be makeshift graves of hostages.
*  So places that Hamas have hidden the bodies of Israeli soldiers taken captive on October
*  7th.
*  So in other words, they might have some specific knowledge of where to look and where to find things.
*  Exactly.
*  The Israeli military was hoping to squeeze as much information as they could from those
*  people.
*  But the flip side of it is that it also created a lot of paperwork and bureaucracy and required
*  logistics and coordination by different units and different agencies as well.
*  This suggests that senior commanders did not only know about it, but sanctioned at least
*  several versions of this tactic.
*  And what did the Israeli military say to you when you confronted them about the practice
*  before you published your article?
*  The Israeli military did not deny this.
*  They said in the statement that its directives and guidelines strictly prohibit the use of
*  detained Gaza civilians for military operations.
*  It added that the account of the Palestinian detainees and soldiers interviewed by the
*  Times would be examined by the relevant authorities.
*  So they said they'd look into it.
*  What exactly are the laws and conventions around this?
*  So using civilians or militants as human shields in a battlefield is completely illegal, not
*  only by international law, but also by Israeli law.
*  And Israel has some experience with that.
*  About two and a half decades ago, the Israeli military used Palestinian civilians for risky
*  missions mostly in the West Bank.
*  And this went to court.
*  And the Israeli Supreme Court said that this is completely prohibited under Israeli law
*  and ordered the military to stop with this practice.
*  But you've shown here that they're doing it again.
*  What happened after your story published?
*  Well, we know that it was discussed in the military and the government, but we can't
*  really tell you if the military took serious steps in order to prevent it.
*  But it's also important to note that the intensity of the war in Gaza went down significantly
*  in the past few months.
*  And it's possible that this practice isn't as widespread as it was in the height of the
*  war.
*  But as far as I know, not one Israeli officer or conscript was punished or even investigated
*  for participating in this practice.
*  Natan, I'm curious about those Israeli soldiers that you talked to and how they saw this practice.
*  I mean, fundamentally, it was something that was meant to protect them, of course.
*  But clearly, some of them must have felt uncomfortable with it because they were talking to you,
*  a journalist, about it.
*  Right.
*  We won't be able to report on this story if it wasn't for the many Israeli soldiers who
*  felt disgust and disturbed and horrified by the fact that the Israeli military is using
*  this practice.
*  One soldier told us that his entire platoon pushed back so hard that they basically stopped
*  using this practice in their platoon, releasing the two Palestinian civilians who they were
*  using as human shields.
*  And I think that one thing that really resonated with me is that a soldier said that, you know,
*  even if this war is justified, it doesn't mean that everything we do or everything that
*  we can do in this war is justified.
*  Natan, at a high level, it seems like what your reporting shows, and correct me if I'm
*  wrong here, is that the Israeli military, like Hamas, is willing to sacrifice Palestinian
*  civilians for their own military purposes.
*  And Israel, of course, accuses Hamas of hiding within civilian populations, essentially using
*  Palestinians as human shields in Gaza.
*  And now we know that Israel is also using Palestinians as human shields.
*  So I'm wondering if you think that the correct way to understand your reporting here is actually
*  a sort of shared disregard, both on the part of the Israeli military and Hamas for Palestinian
*  civilian life.
*  Well, there is a common thread in the disregard to Palestinian lives, and both are terribly
*  wrong.
*  But they're each going about it in their own way.
*  Hamas is a terrorist organization that is showing disregard for its own people, whereas
*  Israel is a sovereign state that is violating the rules of war.
*  And I think that an important takeaway from this story is how the Israeli military, which
*  is a military of a state that is a member of the UN, that has, you know, the most powerful
*  nations in the world as allies, has its military standards being deteriorating to a place that
*  it hasn't been ever before, namely using Palestinians as human shields in this widespread way.
*  And one way to understand how it could have deteriorated to this point is to be reminded
*  of the shock of Israeli society after seeing the October 7th atrocities.
*  And the Israeli society was just traumatized by this, which clouded the moral judgment
*  of many Israeli soldiers walking into their rows in the military and later marching into
*  Gaza.
*  In other words, there's an emotional response that's happening on the part of Israelis and
*  Israeli citizens who, of course, are also Israeli soldiers.
*  And that is clouding, in some ways, judgment and allowing them or perhaps kind of inviting
*  them to see Palestinians in this dehumanized way.
*  Yeah.
*  And also made them think that Hamas are Palestinians and that Palestinians are Hamas, which is
*  something that is a bit hard for the greater Israeli society to understand that there are
*  many Palestinians who oppose Hamas or many Palestinians who are suffering from Hamas
*  and who suffered from Hamas even from before the war.
*  But this shows a deterioration in the regards to human lives by the Israeli military and
*  something that we've never seen before.
*  Where then does Israel go from here?
*  So we're in the stage of the war in which the intensity of the fighting is winding down
*  in Gaza.
*  And also, the ICC have just issued the orders against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
*  and former Minister of Defense Yoav Galant.
*  So these two things make it harder for Israelis to ignore the consequences of the war in Gaza,
*  namely the vast destruction and the many, tens of, Saudis of Palestinians who died in
*  this conflict.
*  And now Israeli society that has justified this war throughout needs to face unjustified
*  parts of it, like in the case that Bilal Patrick and I uncovered about how it's using Palestinians
*  as human shields.
*  Natan, thank you.
*  Thank you, Sabrina.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  Early this morning, the ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah
*  went into effect.
*  The deal was announced by President Biden in a televised address from the White House
*  on Tuesday night.
*  He said it was designed to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah permanently.
*  It was a major turning point in a conflict that had displaced over a million Lebanese
*  and tens of thousands of Israelis.
*  The conflict started on October 7th when Hezbollah began firing into Israel in solidarity with
*  Hamas.
*  Israel later retaliated, killing the group's longtime leader, planting explosives in the
*  pagers used by the group's operatives, and conducting airstrikes against Hezbollah strongholds
*  in Lebanon.
*  The fighting has killed more than 3,000 Lebanese and 100 Israelis and severely damaged Hezbollah.
*  In the hours before the ceasefire was set to take effect, Israel continued to hit Hezbollah
*  strongholds in Lebanon in the heaviest barrage since the war began.
*  The Lebanese parliament is expected to approve the agreement in a vote on Wednesday.
