# The Final Weeks of Biden's Presidency
**New York Times Podcasts:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w)
*  Biden, among other things, is considering issuing preemptive pardons that would protect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=0.0s)]
*  potential targets of a criminal investigation by the incoming Trump administration. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=5.74s)]
*  We've talked so much on the show about Trump DOJ's pretty much open commitment to going [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=9.66s)]
*  after certain of his rivals and enemies. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=15.58s)]
*  It was interesting that Biden came out and said, I am thinking about doing this. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=19.8s)]
*  Do we know who might be at the top of that list for preemptive pardons? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=22.5s)]
*  And do they want them? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=28.28s)]
*  Because getting a preemptive pardon from the president suggests that you might have done [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=29.4s)]
*  something wrong. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=33.04s)]
*  This has been a huge subject within the White House and on Capitol Hill, and it really did, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=34.04s)]
*  as I understand it, originate from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=39.6s)]
*  There are a lot of members of Congress who are concerned that the way he often frames [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=42.6s)]
*  it is, you know, this person should be investigated. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=47.72s)]
*  Now I just want to point out, because Trump's people often do, he told me at the press, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=51.68s)]
*  that he wasn't going to direct the DOJ on what to do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=56.040000000000006s)]
*  And maybe that will be true, maybe it won't be true, but it almost doesn't need to be [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=58.92s)]
*  true because they know what he wants. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=61.32000000000001s)]
*  And they know what he'd like to see done. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  So these folks are worried about being targeted for trying to hold Trump accountable for things [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=65.36s)]
*  like trying to stay in office after losing an election. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=73.84s)]
*  Or talking about Liz Cheney. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=77.08000000000001s)]
*  Liz Cheney, for instance, or Benny Thompson, who co-chaired the J-6 committee with her, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  Anthony Fauci, who is a top infectious diseases official in government for decades. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=83.47999999999999s)]
*  Including during the Trump administration. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  And incurred a lot of anger for his coronavirus era recommendations. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  People can take issue with some of the recommendations without suggesting he somehow committed a crime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=95.28s)]
*  And that's where that leap goes. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=100.0s)]
*  But if you accept a pardon, you are acknowledging some level of wrongdoing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  And these folks generally don't believe they did anything wrong. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=106.52s)]
*  Number one. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=109.52s)]
*  Number two, the challenge for the Biden White House is where is the line? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=110.52s)]
*  Where do you stop? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=115.6s)]
*  Biden also made a fascinating admission in this conversation with USA Today. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=116.6s)]
*  And it was this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Although he believes he could have beaten Trump had he stayed in the race, which we'll [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=122.16s)]
*  never really know the answer to, he said he's unsure, he acknowledged an uncertainty that [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=125.72s)]
*  he would have made it through a second term. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=130.96s)]
*  That's a big thing to acknowledge, Zolan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=133.6s)]
*  I thought that was his most clear acknowledgement of what many Democrats have been fearing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=138.12s)]
*  You know, one thing I would often hear is it's not necessarily that he's 82 years old. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  It's what happens when he's 86. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=151.12s)]
*  What happens at the end of a second term? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=152.96s)]
*  And does he have the ability to fully carry out that service? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  And here you saw him acknowledging that concern as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  I also think he was speaking to, we've been reporting a lot on just Biden's sort of mood [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=161.28s)]
*  in his mindset in these final months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, there's been frustration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=168.56s)]
*  He does believe that he had the ability to beat Trump if he had stayed at the top of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=172.56s)]
*  the ticket. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  He's also very reflective right now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=179.36s)]
*  And I think the USA Today interview showed that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  He's in this period where he's reflecting on his long career, but also thinking about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=184.4s)]
*  what could have been if he hadn't dropped out. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=188.8s)]
*  But to be clear, I mean, most polling does throw doubt on the fact that he had the ability [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=191.52s)]
*  to beat Trump. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=196.8s)]
*  Can I just make one point real quick, Michael, in terms of what Zolan is saying? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  He is reflecting, but he's reflecting on what he believes he was denied. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=202.4s)]
*  He's not reflecting on mistakes that he made or how the White House handled questions about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=205.84s)]
*  his age or the fact that, you know, large numbers of reporters were attacked on social [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  media and elsewhere for raising questions that were taking place in front of their eyes. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=218.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=222.8s)]
*  About his age and ability. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=223.04000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=224.4s)]
*  And to deliver the statement of, yes, I could have won, but who knows if I can't say for [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  sure if I could have served the whole four years. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=230.16000000000003s)]
*  That's a pretty astonishing statement. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=233.28s)]
*  So, David, is that an admission of irresponsibility on Biden's part? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=235.44s)]
*  You've covered this presidency for its entirety to suggest that you might not be able to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  fulfill the obligations of President of the United States Commander in Chief for a full [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=244.24s)]
*  term, but that you were determined to do it anyway. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  It borders on raising serious questions about judgment. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=253.12s)]
*  It sure does, Michael, because it raises the question, when, Mr. President, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=258.32s)]
*  did you come to that conclusion? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  Before or after you decided not to run. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOnkzg8r3w&t=265.6s)]
