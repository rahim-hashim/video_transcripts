# A Chinese Balloon and a Diplomatic Showdown
**New York Times - The Daily:** [February 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=0.0s)]
*  Over the past week, an object of curiosity in the sky over Montana turned into a crisis [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=12.76s)]
*  between the U.S. and China. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=18.48s)]
*  Today, my colleague Edward Wong, on how a balloon could trigger such a high-stakes showdown, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=20.68s)]
*  and what it says about the relationship between the world's two superpowers that it did. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=27.2s)]
*  It's Monday, February 6th. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=42.72s)]
*  Ed, tell us the saga of this Chinese balloon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=47.72s)]
*  Well, I think it first started on Wednesday. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  That's the moon. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=58.4s)]
*  Well, what the heck is that? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=59.4s)]
*  Residents in Montana looked up in the sky and saw this mysterious object. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  What planet is that? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  I have no idea what it is. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=69.16s)]
*  It's been there stationary for about the last 35 minutes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=71.88s)]
*  That's not the sun. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=75.88s)]
*  What the heck is that? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=77.38s)]
*  It was hovering. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=81.6s)]
*  It was bobbing around. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=82.6s)]
*  It did look like a balloon, but it also looked like maybe a planet, a star. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=84.32s)]
*  And then another mysterious thing happened on Wednesday. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=89.39999999999999s)]
*  I am sitting in my driveway here in Billings, Montana. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=92.72s)]
*  There is a ground stop on our airport. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  The authorities shut down the airport around Billings, Montana for three hours. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  And then that really set people speculating about what exactly was going on in the sky [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=106.54s)]
*  above their heads. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  And could they tell what it was with a naked eye? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  It was hard to tell what's a naked eye, but some photographers started zooming in on it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=120.02000000000001s)]
*  And once you looked at those magnified images, it became much more apparent that it was a [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=124.54s)]
*  balloon, this round object. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=129.5s)]
*  And there was this darker part of it on its underbelly that seemed like a carriage of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=131.68s)]
*  some sort that was housing solar panels, surveillance equipment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=137.08s)]
*  These people who were capturing these images started posting something on social media. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=141.56s)]
*  So word was starting to spread around, at least the residents of Montana. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  And then the next afternoon on Thursday, NBC News broke the story that the object in the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=153.72s)]
*  sky above Montana that all these people have been looking at, that they've been taking [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=159.86s)]
*  photos of, was actually a Chinese spy balloon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=164.12s)]
*  And the Pentagon held a briefing very shortly after that to confirm that news and to say [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=167.28s)]
*  that they were monitoring it and trying to decide what to do about it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  So China had been caught spying on the U.S.? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=176.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=179.68s)]
*  China had sent up this balloon at some point. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=181.12s)]
*  It had spent days drifting across the northwest of the U.S. through Alaska and Canada and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=184.12s)]
*  then arrived in Montana. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=189.28s)]
*  And what was the significance of Montana, Ed? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=191.92s)]
*  Well, the Pentagon and U.S. officials were very concerned that this balloon was above [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=194.12s)]
*  Montana because it houses 150 intercontinental ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=198.88s)]
*  warheads in large silos. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  And we don't know for sure, but the fact that the balloon drifted over Montana could have [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  been an effort by Chinese officials to collect information on these missile silos. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=212.0s)]
*  OK, but countries spy on each other, right? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=217.18s)]
*  U.S. spies on China, China spies on the U.S. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  Why make such a big deal of it now? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=222.62s)]
*  U.S. officials have told us that this has happened before. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=224.3s)]
*  The Pentagon came out and said that it's happened three times during the Trump administration, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=228.74s)]
*  one time early in the Biden administration, and that in each instance they had appeared [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=235.14000000000001s)]
*  briefly in the U.S. or over the continental U.S. and then drifted away. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=239.22s)]
*  This time it was different because the balloon lingered much longer than in the previous episodes. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=244.94s)]
*  OK, so the balloon's up there in the air. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=250.94s)]
*  The Pentagon knows about it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=253.6s)]
*  What do they decide to do about it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=255.28s)]
*  Well, the Pentagon officials are looking at this object and they realize it's a huge machine. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=256.96s)]
*  Just to under-encourage itself, the part that has the solar panels and the surveillance [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=262.88s)]
*  equipment is the size of three school buses. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=266.64s)]
*  And then the round part of the balloon's even larger than that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=269.52s)]
*  So there was talk about possibly shooting down the balloon, but Pentagon leaders eventually [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=272.72s)]
*  decided that that could cause damage on the ground. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  The debris raining down might hit people, it might hit buildings. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=281.18s)]
*  So they decided to hold off on that and track the progress of the balloon to find a spot [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=285.42s)]
*  at which they could bring it down. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=291.92s)]
*  So basically they leave it in the air? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  They leave it in the air and they use various devices and also deploy jets to keep an eye on it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=296.02000000000004s)]
*  So the US says this is basically China spying on the US. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=302.92s)]
*  How does China respond? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=307.6s)]
*  What do they say it is? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  At first China doesn't acknowledge that this event took place, but then they do come out [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=310.72s)]
*  with a statement from the Foreign Ministry and it says that China did send up an aerial [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=315.18s)]
*  surveillance device into the sky and that it arrived in the US. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=320.12s)]
*  They say that this device was used for gathering research on weather. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=324.88000000000005s)]
*  That was a weather research balloon. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=329.0s)]
*  And they also say that it was an innocent civilian device and that they had no intention [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=331.76s)]
*  of sending it to the US. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=336.74s)]
*  It went off course according to their statement. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=337.98s)]
*  And what does the US government say about that? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=341.7s)]
*  Does it believe it? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=343.58s)]
*  Pentagon officials insist that their own research on the machine shows that it was an intelligence [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=345.32s)]
*  gathering device of a national security nature, not something innocent being used for monitoring [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=349.84s)]
*  weather. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=356.48s)]
*  There was a very unusual part of the Chinese statement and that was a line expressing regret [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=357.68s)]
*  for what happened. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=362.64s)]
*  And that's very rare for China to say that. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=364.08s)]
*  They oftentimes don't acknowledge that an unusual incident took place and very rarely [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=366.96s)]
*  do they express any hint at an apology or any sort of regret for what happened. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=373.08s)]
*  What was behind that? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=378.06s)]
*  What was behind that very unusual gesture from the Chinese? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=379.06s)]
*  Well the really critical thing to understand here is the timing of the appearance of this [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=382.88s)]
*  balloon. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=387.23999999999995s)]
*  It showed up in the US in the lead up to this important diplomatic meeting that was set [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=388.23999999999995s)]
*  to take place in Beijing between US and Chinese officials. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=393.28s)]
*  The US Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, was supposed to get on a plane on Friday night [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  and land in Beijing on Sunday where he was going to meet with President Xi Jinping of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=401.7s)]
*  China. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=405.88s)]
*  And this was the first time since 2018 that a US Secretary of State was planning to visit [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  China. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=412.12s)]
*  But the balloon put the trip in jeopardy and it appeared that China was putting out this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=413.64s)]
*  apologetic sounding statement in an attempt to salvage it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=417.76s)]
*  But that wasn't enough. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=422.2s)]
*  Jin, if you'll allow me, I'd just like to briefly address the presence of the Chinese [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=423.2s)]
*  surveillance balloon in US airspace. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=427.26s)]
*  On Friday afternoon, we listened as Secretary Blinken gave a press conference where he said [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=430.06s)]
*  that the Chinese spy balloon was an irresponsible act on the part of the Chinese government. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=434.94s)]
*  The presence of this surveillance balloon in US airspace is a clear violation of US [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=439.22s)]
*  sovereignty and international law. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=443.78000000000003s)]
*  That the balloon violated US sovereignty and that the trip was off for now. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=446.42s)]
*  In the meantime, the United States will continue to maintain open lines of communication with [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=451.18s)]
*  China, including to address this ongoing incident. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=455.26000000000005s)]
*  So all this business with the balloon got pretty serious in the end. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=461.1s)]
*  It's now a diplomatic crisis. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=464.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was a big deal that the trip was canceled. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=466.5s)]
*  The leaders have been planning this for months. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  But once the Chinese spy balloon became public, then this trip became a much more politically [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=472.1s)]
*  sensitive topic. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=477.78s)]
*  Well, first of all, this has been a tremendous embarrassment for the United States of America. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=478.78s)]
*  Republican lawmakers and politicians had started bashing Biden for not taking harder action [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=483.98s)]
*  against the balloon, maybe shooting it down immediately. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=489.56s)]
*  They could have shot this thing down well before it was over Montana. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=492.46s)]
*  I mean, they could have shot this thing down before it hit the coast of Alaska. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=495.9s)]
*  And also taking harder action on China for sending the balloon in the first place. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=500.18s)]
*  Well, he needs to address it directly. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=504.7s)]
*  Take it seriously. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=506.65999999999997s)]
*  I think he believes it's like a Taylor Swift concert moving across America, some kind of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=507.65999999999997s)]
*  a tour. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=511.58s)]
*  This is not the Chinese spy balloon tour. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=512.58s)]
*  He needs to address it head on and not just kind of brush it off. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=515.06s)]
*  And the Biden administration is very sensitive to how its China policies appear to the public. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=519.86s)]
*  It wants to appear sufficiently hawkish on China, as do Republican leaders. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=525.16s)]
*  Each side wants to appear more hawkish than the other on China. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=530.0s)]
*  So Ed, this balloon seems to have caused quite a bit of diplomatic damage. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=540.64s)]
*  Remind us, what is its fate in the end? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=546.28s)]
*  So the balloon kept drifting for a couple of days over to the southeastern U.S. pushed [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=548.68s)]
*  by the winds and ended up off the coast of South Carolina. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=553.0s)]
*  And then on Saturday, they shot it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=557.4s)]
*  The Pentagon sent a couple of F-22 fighter jets up into the sky. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=560.08s)]
*  They just shot it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=563.64s)]
*  They did? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=564.64s)]
*  Yep, they just blew it up. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=565.64s)]
*  See the balloon falling? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=566.64s)]
*  And shot down the balloon with a single missile. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=567.64s)]
*  And while the story of the balloon had ended there in those waters off South Carolina, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=573.72s)]
*  This whole episode shows how fragile and how sensitive relations between the two world's [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=578.0s)]
*  major superpowers have become. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=583.16s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=599.76s)]
*  Okay, so Ed, this balloon scuttles this really important diplomatic mission. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=601.52s)]
*  And that really reveals the tensions in this relationship between U.S. and China. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=612.12s)]
*  So remind us of that backstory. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=617.52s)]
*  Why had it gotten so bad? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=619.64s)]
*  U.S.-China relations are one of the worst points in decades. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=621.24s)]
*  And it's been getting worse for years now. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=625.14s)]
*  Soon after President Xi took office in 2012, U.S. officials realized that he was taking [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  China in a much more autocratic direction. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  He was taking repressive actions against the ethnic Uyghur minority in Xinjiang. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=636.24s)]
*  He was taking hardline actions against people in Hong Kong. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=640.58s)]
*  And he was also pushing his military to be much more adventurous in the territories around [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  China. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  That included in the Indian Himalayas, in the South China Sea, in the East China Sea, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=650.5600000000001s)]
*  and also across the Taiwan Strait. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=654.96s)]
*  And as you know, Taiwan is the most sensitive issue between the U.S. and China. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=657.4s)]
*  And remind us why Taiwan in particular. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=663.0799999999999s)]
*  Why is it the most sensitive issue here? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, when the Communist Party took over China in 1949, the people who opposed them fled [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=666.8s)]
*  to Taiwan and set up a government in exile there. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=672.28s)]
*  And since then, the U.S. has pledged support to Taiwan, which is a democratic island. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=675.68s)]
*  It has said that it will give Taiwan weapons of the defense of nature to protect itself [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=681.56s)]
*  in the event of an invasion by China. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=687.12s)]
*  But in Beijing, the Communist Party says that Taiwan is part of its territory. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=690.0s)]
*  It's not an independent nation and that it will take Taiwan by force if Taiwan doesn't [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=694.6s)]
*  agree at some point to reunite with mainland China. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=701.48s)]
*  You know who's getting the oil? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=704.5600000000001s)]
*  China. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=705.84s)]
*  China is ripping us off. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=706.84s)]
*  In the Trump administration, national security officials took a much more confrontational [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=708.88s)]
*  stand toward China. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=713.36s)]
*  And Taiwan was one of the big issues that they focused on. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=714.72s)]
*  On Friday, Trump told The Wall Street Journal that America's one China policy, of course, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=717.96s)]
*  it officially recognizes Beijing's government, but not Taiwan's. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=721.64s)]
*  He said that policy, one China, is negotiable. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=725.2s)]
*  They started talking about whether China might try and invade Taiwan imminently. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=729.44s)]
*  And they also started to try and expand the diplomatic space between the U.S. and Taiwan. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=734.12s)]
*  And what about in the Biden administration? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=739.96s)]
*  In the Biden administration, talk in Washington of a potential invasion of Taiwan by China [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=742.28s)]
*  accelerated. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  And they started looking at all this against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=748.8399999999999s)]
*  They thought that if Russia would invade Ukraine without any regard for the existing world [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  order, then China might do the same thing with Taiwan. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=759.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=762.0s)]
*  After Russia invades Ukraine, suddenly Taiwan takes on a whole new significance. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=763.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=768.04s)]
*  And President Biden himself has strong views on Taiwan. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=769.04s)]
*  Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=771.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=776.64s)]
*  You are? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=777.64s)]
*  That's a commitment we made. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=778.64s)]
*  He said four times now that the U.S. military will defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=781.9599999999999s)]
*  invasion, which is different than what other recent American presidents have said. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=787.06s)]
*  U.S. officials say there hasn't been change to U.S. policy on Taiwan, and they don't want [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=791.5999999999999s)]
*  to explicitly say that the U.S. will defend Taiwan. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=795.64s)]
*  But Biden has been very out there saying that. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=799.04s)]
*  And congressional leaders have their own strong points of view on Taiwan. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=802.5999999999999s)]
*  This morning, the meeting China did not want to happen. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=806.8s)]
*  Last August, Speaker Pelosi made a visit to Taiwan, the first by House speakers since the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=810.4s)]
*  1990s. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=816.12s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi has said America will never abandon the island during a trip that's been condemned [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=817.12s)]
*  as a major provocation by China. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=822.0799999999999s)]
*  And it caused tensions between U.S. and China to spike. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=824.36s)]
*  China had been asking the Biden administration to prevent her from going. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=827.76s)]
*  And then after she did go, it started sending more planes across the Taiwan Strait, and [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=831.4s)]
*  it began lobbying missiles around Taiwan. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=836.52s)]
*  And at least five of those even landed in the waters near Japan. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=839.46s)]
*  OK, so the tensions are extremely high. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=842.48s)]
*  Taiwan is at the center of it, and the Biden administration is genuinely worried that there [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=846.2s)]
*  could actually be some military confrontation. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=849.72s)]
*  What does the U.S. do? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=853.04s)]
*  During the Biden administration, Pentagon officials and other national security officials [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=855.0799999999999s)]
*  have been trying to build up their military alliances and partnerships all across Asia. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=859.48s)]
*  So for example, it's been building up a partnership with Australia and Britain, and it's agreed [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=865.92s)]
*  to give nuclear submarine technology to Australia, which is a big deal. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=871.24s)]
*  And China sees that as a huge move against the Chinese military. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=875.64s)]
*  The Biden administration has also said that it supports Japan in revitalizing its military [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  and moving away from its pacifist stand and having Japan have a strong military that can [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=887.4s)]
*  be deployed in other parts of Asia. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=894.1999999999999s)]
*  And just last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, on a visit to the Philippines, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=897.4s)]
*  announced that the U.S. military would have greater access to as many as nine different [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=902.48s)]
*  military bases across that island chain. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=906.64s)]
*  The U.S. military has had a small presence in the Philippines, but this would give it [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=909.66s)]
*  a much greater presence across the entire country, including at some sites that are [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=914.6999999999999s)]
*  very close to Taiwan. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=918.9s)]
*  And Pentagon officials say that they could put equipment at these different sites as [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=920.74s)]
*  well as troops, and the presence would be temporary, but it would still put the U.S. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=925.02s)]
*  in a much stronger position if there was a confrontation with China at some point. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=929.8199999999999s)]
*  OK, so there's this rising tension over Taiwan that's spilling over into worries about a [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=934.58s)]
*  potential military confrontation. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=942.82s)]
*  What else is going on here? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=945.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, one big change that's taking place in the relationship is that national security [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=946.58s)]
*  issues have bled into economic issues now. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=950.4200000000001s)]
*  These are the two largest economies in the world, and they've always had a robust trade [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=953.34s)]
*  relationship. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=956.6600000000001s)]
*  And a lot of people saw those trade ties as the platform for stability in the relationship. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=957.9399999999999s)]
*  That still happens, but now there's very sensitive sectors that U.S. officials want to decouple [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=964.98s)]
*  from China. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=971.3s)]
*  And what's an example, Ed? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=972.5799999999999s)]
*  The biggest recent example is semiconductors, and these are these small chips that are used [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=974.14s)]
*  in everything from our household appliances, like the refrigerators in your kitchen, to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=978.9s)]
*  weapons that the military uses for the most advanced forms of warfare. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=985.02s)]
*  They were basically what make the world run at this point. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=989.3000000000001s)]
*  And the U.S. now sees China as a very big rival in innovating semiconductors, and it [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=992.1s)]
*  wants to keep it from being able to advance this technology. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1000.1s)]
*  The future of the chip industry is going to be made in America. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1003.0600000000001s)]
*  Made in America. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1008.4200000000001s)]
*  Biden administration officials have said that this is a foundational technology and that [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1011.66s)]
*  it's not good enough for the U.S. to just keep a few paces ahead of China on this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1016.3s)]
*  They have to prevent China from being able to innovate this type of sector and this type [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1021.42s)]
*  of industry. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1025.8999999999999s)]
*  China has become more aggressive in what they call their military-civil fusion strategy, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1027.6599999999999s)]
*  which is buying our sophisticated chips, which is supposedly for commercial purposes, and [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1034.06s)]
*  putting them into military equipment to advance their military. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1039.3s)]
*  And we're not going to stand for that. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1042.82s)]
*  Last October, the Biden administration took a very aggressive and ambitious step on this. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1045.1399999999999s)]
*  They announced that they would prevent U.S. companies from exporting certain types of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1050.34s)]
*  semiconductor chips to China. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1055.22s)]
*  And they also said U.S. companies could not export certain types of semiconductor [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1057.3799999999999s)]
*  manufacturing technology to China. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1062.18s)]
*  In that sense, they were trying to prevent China from being able to use tools to make [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1064.94s)]
*  its own advanced chips. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1069.26s)]
*  And the U.S. has also been in talks with allies, the Netherlands and Japan, which both have [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1071.18s)]
*  critical semiconductor tool technology to try and keep those countries and the companies [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1076.6200000000001s)]
*  there from exporting their own manufacturing equipment to China. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1082.38s)]
*  Okay, so the tensions really had been rising both militarily but also economically. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1086.7s)]
*  So given that, what was the goal for the meeting that Blinken was supposed to have been on? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1092.86s)]
*  Well, with tensions so high between the two countries, both sides were looking at this [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1097.74s)]
*  meeting as a way to bring the temperature down on this confrontational stand that both [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1102.62s)]
*  countries are taking against each other. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1108.4599999999998s)]
*  And that attitude was adopted by both President Biden and President Xi when they met in [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1110.9399999999998s)]
*  Bali last November. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1116.6999999999998s)]
*  You and I have had a number of candid and useful conversations over the years and since [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1118.46s)]
*  I became president as well, you're kind enough to call me to congratulate me and I congratulate [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1124.3000000000002s)]
*  you as well. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1129.66s)]
*  And I believe there's a little substitute, though, to face-to-face discussions. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1131.5s)]
*  The two met there on the sidelines of a summit of major world leaders and they agreed that [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1137.42s)]
*  the top U.S. diplomat, Tony Blinken, should make a trip to China. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1143.18s)]
*  So the two sides spent months planning for this meeting and the stakes were much higher [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1147.98s)]
*  for China. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1152.3s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1153.26s)]
*  Well, China had been in this very strict lockdown for three years during COVID. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1153.82s)]
*  President Xi had not been present on the world stage and other countries were questioning [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1158.06s)]
*  its diplomatic engagement. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1162.38s)]
*  Its economy was suffering and was trying to grapple with that slowdown. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1164.38s)]
*  And tensions with the greatest superpower in the world had been rising throughout this [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1168.54s)]
*  entire time. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1172.46s)]
*  So China realized it had to defuse some of those tensions and this trip by Tony Blinken [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1173.6599999999999s)]
*  was seen as a big symbolic step in re-engagement to a certain degree with the U.S. and making [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1180.06s)]
*  sure that there were guardrails on the relationship. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1187.1s)]
*  And what about the U.S.? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1191.26s)]
*  How were they seeing this meeting? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1192.46s)]
*  Well, what I was hearing from U.S. officials was that they didn't have big expectations [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1194.06s)]
*  that there would be major announcements coming out of this meeting. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1198.54s)]
*  They didn't have big agreements lined up, but they did see this as an important opportunity [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1201.58s)]
*  to keep channels of communication at the very top levels open. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1207.02s)]
*  They figured that if there's some sort of accidental military conflict that occurs [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1210.86s)]
*  in Asia or if there's some other confrontation between the U.S. and China, they need to make [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1216.06s)]
*  sure that the leaders of both countries can talk to each other and defuse the tensions. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1220.46s)]
*  So they were trying to get diplomacy working again, basically, kind of cranking it back [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1224.62s)]
*  into gear to avoid having a complete breakdown if something small happens. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1229.34s)]
*  For example, a spy balloon floating above the U.S. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1234.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. The ironic thing is that the exact type of episode that they feared would happen [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1238.78s)]
*  and lead to a break in communications between two countries is what happened in the case [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1243.4199999999998s)]
*  of the spy balloon. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1247.4199999999998s)]
*  This incident that took place actually led to this break in the trip and the thing that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1248.54s)]
*  they were trying to establish with the trip fell apart because of that. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1255.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. So the point of the trip was to make it so that something so small as a balloon [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1258.94s)]
*  wouldn't derail the relationship. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1263.3400000000001s)]
*  And in fact, it did because they hadn't had the trip. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1265.5800000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1268.14s)]
*  Okay. So if this meeting is so important to China, you know, is something that they really [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1269.5s)]
*  wanted to happen, why send a spy balloon exactly at this moment? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1273.18s)]
*  It does seem like this was an own goal by China, a sabotaging of something they really [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1277.66s)]
*  wanted by parts of their own system. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1282.7s)]
*  And there are some people who speculate that maybe more hawkish elements in their system, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1284.94s)]
*  possibly in the military, wanted to send this over to the U.S. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1289.42s)]
*  to embarrass Biden and Blinken on the eve of Blinken's trip to China. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1292.6200000000001s)]
*  But I think there's a more plausible explanation, and that's that there's incompetence in the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1297.18s)]
*  system and the officials who sent up the balloon didn't realize where the balloon would end up [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1301.82s)]
*  or at what time it would end up in the U.S. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1307.58s)]
*  And that it would result in the scuttling of this important diplomatic trip that President Xi [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1310.46s)]
*  and his aides really wanted to happen. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1315.74s)]
*  So essentially, there's a reasonable chance that China just kind of messed this up here. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1318.22s)]
*  I mean, as you say, own goal. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1323.5s)]
*  Like, it lost out on this diplomatic chance that it really wanted because potentially [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1325.5800000000002s)]
*  it just lost track of this thing. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1331.1000000000001s)]
*  I think what this shows is that it's very difficult in this relationship for each country [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1332.94s)]
*  to read the intentions of the other one. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1338.14s)]
*  Right now, U.S. officials are trying to look back at this episode and figure out what [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1340.22s)]
*  exactly happened. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1345.18s)]
*  Why did China send up this balloon? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1346.38s)]
*  Could it do something like this in the future? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1348.5400000000002s)]
*  What are its intentions when it does these actions? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1350.6200000000001s)]
*  And both sides are then trying to figure out what the next step now is in diplomacy. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1353.5800000000002s)]
*  How can you bring stability to a relationship when something like this, something as small [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1358.14s)]
*  as a spy balloon, can take place on the eve of a diplomatic trip and lead to these [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1363.34s)]
*  greater tensions between the world's two great superpowers? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1369.26s)]
*  Right. Like, fundamentally, what does it say about the relationship between the United [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1376.6999999999998s)]
*  States and China that one little balloon can derail this major act of diplomacy? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1381.1s)]
*  I think both governments hope that their relationship can reach a place where an event [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1386.54s)]
*  like this can be something that can be discussed, talked about, and diplomats can move forward [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1391.26s)]
*  and conduct business. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1396.78s)]
*  But right now, where things stand, it's hard to see that happening. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1398.3799999999999s)]
*  And I think U.S. officials and Chinese officials are braced for many more incidents like this. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1402.3799999999999s)]
*  Ed, thank you. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1413.34s)]
*  Thanks, Sabrina. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1414.54s)]
*  It's always great to hear from you. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1415.18s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1421.5s)]
*  Here's what else you should know today. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1429.18s)]
*  Over the weekend, the Democratic Party made sweeping changes in the process it uses for [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1431.5s)]
*  picking presidential nominees, upending decades of tradition. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1435.82s)]
*  On Saturday, the Democratic National Committee approved a primary process that starts the 2024 [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1439.98s)]
*  Democratic presidential circuit in South Carolina, the state that resuscitated President Joe Biden's [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1445.42s)]
*  once-flailing candidacy. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1451.02s)]
*  For years, the party's contests have begun with the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1453.18s)]
*  primary. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1457.9s)]
*  But the party wanted a calendar that better reflects its own racial diversity and the [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1458.7s)]
*  diversity of the country. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1463.74s)]
*  South Carolina will be followed by New Hampshire and Nevada, then Georgia, and then Michigan. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1465.66s)]
*  And on Monday, two powerful earthquakes struck Turkey, knocking down buildings and killing [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1472.46s)]
*  more than 1,600 people, raising the specter of a new humanitarian disaster in a region [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1478.38s)]
*  already wracked by war. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1483.74s)]
*  The 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit at 4.17 a.m. local time and was centered about 20 miles [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1485.5s)]
*  from Gaziantep, a Turkish provincial capital near the border with Syria. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1491.74s)]
*  It was felt as far away as Damascus, Beirut, and Cairo. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1496.38s)]
*  A second earthquake hit nine hours later on Monday afternoon. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1500.38s)]
*  Residents and rescue workers on both sides of the border, in multiple cities, scrambled [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1504.38s)]
*  to look for survivors. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1509.18s)]
*  Hundreds were believed to be trapped under the rubble, and the toll was expected to rise. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1510.7s)]
*  Today's episode was produced by Will Reed and Rachelle Bonja, with help from Shannon Lin. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tskoHE-BOMU&t=1517.18s)]
