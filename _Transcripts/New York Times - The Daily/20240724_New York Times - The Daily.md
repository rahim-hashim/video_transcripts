# The Lingering Questions about the Attempt to Kill Trump
**New York Times Podcasts:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyyiHoMCVcY)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernizi, and this is The Daily.
*  In the weeks since the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, the security mistakes that
*  led to the shooting have come into sharp and shocking focus and have now cost the head
*  of the Secret Service her job.
*  Today, my colleague Glenn Thrush on the Secret Service's historic failure.
*  It's Wednesday, July 24th.
*  So, Glenn, you've been reporting on the investigation into the security failures
*  around the assassination attempt of Donald Trump, and they were pretty catastrophic.
*  So much so that the head of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheadle, was hauled before
*  Congress to explain herself.
*  And then on Tuesday morning, she resigned, which puts the blame pretty directly on the
*  Secret Service.
*  It was a monumental failure, the worst failure in the Secret Service for at least 40 years
*  and maybe of all time.
*  There was just a tremendous lack of coordination between the group of Secret Service
*  personnel who were tasked with protecting Donald Trump and the local authorities that
*  the Secret Service works in coordination with to control the site around the perimeter
*  of the event.
*  OK, so let's unpack that.
*  What have we learned in the week since the shooting about the mistakes that led to this
*  failure?
*  Quite a bit, Sabrina, and none of it was good for the Secret Service and ultimately for
*  Cheadle.
*  Let's start first off with how the Secret Service divided the responsibility on the
*  ground.
*  So the way that this was set up is that there was a perimeter, and inside that perimeter
*  was essentially the province of the Secret Service.
*  So you can kind of think of that as the high security area.
*  It's the area in the direct proximity of where Trump was going to speak.
*  Now, outside the perimeter, it gets a little sketchy.
*  This is the province typically of local law enforcement.
*  Now they're working under the aegis of Secret Service, but it appears that the level of
*  security, coordination and attention to that area beyond this fencing was considerably
*  less than inside the perimeter.
*  Right.
*  This was the thing that came up over and over again, that there were these buildings
*  outside the perimeter that were kind of a blind spot for the Secret Service.
*  And why was it that those buildings, in fact, were outside the perimeter?
*  And the issue that's emerging, and I think is going to be the story at the end of the
*  day, is communication or the lack thereof.
*  So what do we know about the communication on the ground that day?
*  And maybe start with when the shooter arrived.
*  Well, we think he arrived sometime after four o'clock in the afternoon based on
*  geolocation data monitored by the FBI looking at his phones.
*  The first visual identification that we know of comes at five o' six when he's observed
*  in this really eerie bit of video that shows him sort of milling around the warehouse
*  where he would eventually take the shot from.
*  Then what happens is the local law enforcement officials see this guy lurking around and
*  they identify him as somebody who might be suspicious and they inform the Secret Service
*  about it.
*  It's not clear what was said or why it was determined that he was not a threat.
*  So they actually identify the shooter before anything happens, but they don't stop him.
*  Yeah, like he's definitely on their radar, so much so that they take a picture of him.
*  But the suspicions are not significant enough that anyone stops the event or delays
*  anything. And it's at this point they kind of lose track of him.
*  Hmm.
*  So one of the next crucial moments is around six o' nine or six ten.
*  At this point, Trump's been on the stage for like five or six minutes.
*  Look, they're all pointing.
*  A bunch of people in the crowd see him climbing onto the roof.
*  And there are videos of this.
*  Yeah, someone's on top of the roof.
*  Look, there he is right there.
*  We have.
*  And they start shouting at law enforcement to pay attention.
*  This is about two minutes before the shooting.
*  Right around this time, a couple of Butler police officers go to check out the warehouse.
*  One of them hoist the other one up onto the roof and they confront crooks.
*  Now picture this.
*  The officer who gets there is basically hanging onto the roof with both hands and he can't
*  draw his weapon. So the shooter at that point turns to him and the officer falls back down.
*  This was another big missed opportunity.
*  There was still time to keep the shooting from happening at this point.
*  Yet they don't keep the shooting from happening.
*  Why not?
*  Here's the problem.
*  The roof crooks was on was sort of a blind spot.
*  There were teams of counter snipers on buildings at the rally, but they don't seem to have
*  had a clear line of sight, according to an analysis by my colleagues.
*  There are a couple of reasons for this.
*  One, the gunman appears to have been concealed by some trees.
*  And then the second reason is the roof had a slight slope so they couldn't quite see him.
*  So shortly before the first shot was fired, you can actually see on the video the snipers
*  repositioning themselves towards crooks.
*  But it was too late.
*  The initial volley of shots then rings out.
*  One of them hits Trump.
*  Five more are fired, some of them apparently into the crowd.
*  And we now know with deadly results.
*  Simultaneously, snipers fire a shot that hits its mark and kills crooks instantly.
*  So this was a day of just catastrophic failures.
*  Let's turn to Washington to the response to all of this.
*  How does the head of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheadle, respond to this when she's
*  called before Congress on Monday?
*  Well, Cheadle was subpoenaed to testify before the House Oversight Committee.
*  This hearing of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability will come to order.
*  And she really walked into the lion's den here.
*  My name is Kimberly Cheadle and I'm the Director of the United States Secret Service.
*  I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today.
*  And she started off the hearing by stating the painfully obvious.
*  The assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump on July 13th is the most
*  significant operational failure of the Secret Service in decades.
*  This was the most significant security failure the agency had had in decades.
*  As a Director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any
*  security lapse of our agency.
*  OK, so let's get into some of the questions lawmakers, and frankly, a lot of us, had
*  when she walked in there.
*  I mean, one of them, and one of the things that's been in my mind, is how was it
*  possible that the building the shooter ended up being on ended up outside the
*  perimeter, not inside the security perimeter?
*  How did she explain that?
*  Not surprisingly, a bunch of lawmakers asked her about this, including Congressman
*  Raja Krishnamurthy of Illinois.
*  The security perimeter was drawn such that the AGR building was placed outside of
*  it. NBC News has reported that in the days before the rally, the Secret Service had
*  identified the building as a vulnerability that required special attention.
*  Correct?
*  That's reporting from NBC?
*  Yes.
*  So I am still looking into an active investigation.
*  I know, but it's been nine days.
*  I mean, you should you should know that.
*  Right.
*  And Cheadle really didn't provide a clear answer.
*  She didn't give specifics.
*  She said that there is a Secret Service investigation ongoing and everybody would
*  have to wait for the results to know exactly what happened and what the findings
*  were.
*  Does your responsibility and the Secret Service's responsibility to protect the
*  principal stop at the perimeter of an event?
*  Our responsibility is to ensure the safety and security of the event itself.
*  But she did take some responsibility, ultimately.
*  She would say the fact that the rooftop was outside the perimeter is not an
*  excuse for what happened.
*  I am not offering that as an excuse.
*  OK.
*  And said that the entire site, including the perimeter and outside the perimeter,
*  was the responsibility of the service.
*  So she did say the buck stops with us, but didn't actually say why the building
*  was outside an area that they were directly responsible for, not local law
*  enforcement.
*  Exactly.
*  And what did she say about why Trump was allowed to go on stage when there was a
*  known suspicious person looking around?
*  She really didn't provide a detailed answer on that one either.
*  Jamie Raskin, who's the top Democrat on the committee, really leaned into that
*  point.
*  Why was he allowed to take the stage with a suspicious person having been
*  identified in the crowd?
*  So I appreciate the question.
*  And her answer was pretty interesting.
*  And I think this is where the entire investigation is headed.
*  If the detail had been past information that there was a threat, the detail would
*  never have brought the former president out onto stage.
*  So you distinguish between someone who is suspicious and someone who's threatening.
*  Is that right?
*  I do.
*  There are a number of times...
*  It's this distinction between a suspicious person and a threat.
*  This person was identified as, quote, suspicious, end quote, not threatening.
*  So she's using kind of technical language here, but what does she mean really about
*  the difference between suspicious person and a threat?
*  Well, that's not entirely clear.
*  That seems to be something of a gray area.
*  If you go to political rallies, you will see all kinds of folks milling around.
*  And, you know, if the Secret Service stopped political events for everybody who
*  looked a little bit hinky, there would never ever be any political speeches.
*  But there is a clear line between someone who is casing out a potential area or seems
*  like they might possess a weapon or is conducting surveillance.
*  And I think this entire investigation is going to hinge on whether or not they had
*  enough data points to determine that Crooks had ascended up the ladder from being a
*  suspicious person to being someone who could threaten the former president.
*  She makes this distinction because for her, there's a meaningful difference in
*  terms of how the Secret Service should respond or is supposed to respond.
*  But what about once he's clearly identified as a threat?
*  I mean, when people are there shouting, there's a guy on the roof with a gun.
*  This is the critical juncture here, right?
*  We're talking about a two to three minute period where it seems like local law
*  enforcement knew that he was something more than just a regular old suspicious
*  person, that he posed a threat.
*  What happened next is really the key.
*  Did they decisively communicate that there was a threat to the Secret Service?
*  Was that information passed to other people or did folks drop the ball?
*  That we don't know.
*  And as you say, a lot of the investigation is going to center on that.
*  Yes.
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they documented this second by second.
*  There's something else that surfaced in the days after the assassination attempt,
*  which was, you know, the Trump campaign said that it had in fact asked for more
*  security resources and that their request was denied by the Secret Service.
*  Did this come up in the hearing?
*  Yeah, it did.
*  They asked for additional help in some form or another.
*  You told them no.
*  It provided kind of limited clarity though.
*  How many times did you tell them no?
*  And what'd you tell them no to?
*  Again, I can not speak to specific incidents, but I can tell you in general terms.
*  There was a lot of muddy back and forth, but specifically regarding the
*  staffing at Butler.
*  Again, I'm not going to get into the specifics of the numbers of personnel
*  that we had there, but we feel that there was a sufficient number of agents assigned.
*  I think the big takeaway was that Cheadle said very clearly that the Butler event
*  was staffed sufficiently with security, that they had enough personnel to deal
*  with whatever threat presented itself.
*  So it wasn't like this happened because they were understaffed for some reason.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  So by the end of the hearing, we still don't have many or really any satisfying
*  answers about how all of this was allowed to happen.
*  Look, Cheadle had one of the most epically terrible days on Capitol Hill that any
*  witness has had in quite some time.
*  And as she continued to deflect, I can speak to you in generalities.
*  No, no, I don't want generalities.
*  I want specifics.
*  You could just see the lawmakers on both sides of the aisle getting angrier and
*  angrier and more and more frustrated as the day dragged on.
*  You can't remember.
*  You got a little Alzheimer's dementia going.
*  I mean, you can't remember.
*  It looks like you guys were cutting corners.
*  That's what it looks like to me.
*  You should have come today ready to give us answers.
*  I call upon you to resign today.
*  Not only should you resign if you refuse to do so, President Biden needs to fire you.
*  It was one of those rare moments on Capitol Hill where you have bipartisan
*  agreement on something and their agreement was that she needed to go.
*  Without objection, the committee stands adjourned.
*  And as I was watching it, I was getting all these texts from law enforcement
*  people and officials who were telling me that there was just no way that she was
*  going to be able to survive 24 hours.
*  And they turned out absolutely to be right.
*  By Tuesday morning, the Secret Service announced through a spokesman that she was,
*  in fact, stepping down and President Biden said that he was going to look for
*  her placement pretty soon.
*  So what happens going forward?
*  I mean, this is of course not a purely academic question.
*  It directly relates to our current moment because we're in the midst of this very
*  intense election campaign.
*  I think it's really important to note that Cheadle in her testimony made it clear
*  the Secret Service isn't waiting for the results of the investigation and it was
*  sort of independent of leadership, but that they were making reforms right now
*  to tighten security.
*  And if there's one good thing that could have possibly come out of this whole
*  fiasco, it's now that they seem much, much more focused on efficiently coordinating
*  with local law enforcement, figuring out how the lines of communications are going
*  to work better and being a little more stringent in terms of identifying threats.
*  But what adds an incredible layer of difficulty to this is that the shooter
*  himself, Thomas Crooks, didn't advertise himself as a threat.
*  He led a very quiet life.
*  He kept to himself.
*  There's no indication that he had a co-conspirator or that he worked for a
*  foreign government.
*  And in the course of attempting to design the best possible system to protect
*  politicians in this country, that's a big threat to the United States.
*  Politicians in this country, that's a big factor.
*  Figuring out who might be a threat is becoming more and more difficult.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Glenn, what have we learned about this shooter Crooks in the weeks since he did
*  the shooting?
*  I mean, last time you and I talked, we didn't know very much.
*  Well, we've been able to fill in some of the blanks, myself and my colleagues at
*  the paper.
*  He was from Bethel Park, which is a modest suburb south of Pittsburgh.
*  And let's talk about the family a little bit.
*  He lived at home with his parents who were both counselors.
*  Both of his parents had physical disabilities.
*  His mother, Mary Crooks, was visually impaired.
*  Neighbors used to see her walking to the train station with a cane.
*  And people told us that the dad had significant mobility problems.
*  Neighbors say that they used to be sort of a friendly family, but they've become
*  much more insular in recent years.
*  They didn't communicate with the outside world quite as much.
*  And the house itself seemed to be somewhat disorderly.
*  I was told that when the FBI came to the house right after Crooks had been
*  killed, they found it to be cluttered, kind of like a compulsive hoarder's house.
*  So the family seems to have been pretty isolated then.
*  But what do we know about Crooks himself?
*  He is described sort of the same way by some of the people he attended school with,
*  that he was polite, that he was friendly, highly intelligent.
*  We were able to obtain some of his school records.
*  He was a straight A student.
*  He participated in class discussions.
*  He truly excelled in science and math and was also known to be very competent
*  working with technical stuff and computers.
*  But he was also kind of isolated and quiet.
*  People say he did not have a large circle of friends and he had virtually no social
*  media presence, which is extraordinarily rare for a 20 year old in America in 2024.
*  Especially given how much he seemed to be online playing video games and all of that.
*  He was online playing video games and also he did a lot of searches.
*  And this is really the most insight that we have in terms of his motive was his search
*  histories, presumably taken by the FBI off of his laptop.
*  And a lot of this information comes from a call that FBI officials had with lawmakers
*  last week. And what we learned is that he searched famous politicians.
*  In addition to President Trump, he searched Joe Biden, but he also searched Merrick Garland,
*  the attorney general and Christopher Wray, the FBI director.
*  And he looked up the dates of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, along with
*  dates of Trump rallies.
*  And he also seems to have looked into the British royal family.
*  So there was really nothing to suggest that he was obsessed with Trump in particular, or
*  really any specific political group or person.
*  They have not found a manifesto and they didn't even find any sort of political paraphernalia
*  in his room. So there's a sense, I think, among investigators that he was really interested
*  in famous people more than pursuing any kind of a partisan path.
*  The one thing I would say as a caveat is investigators keep telling us they're still
*  looking and they don't know what they're going to find.
*  OK, so we don't know much about why Crooks did this.
*  But what have we learned about how he did it?
*  What new has emerged?
*  We now know that he seems to have been really determined and to some extent pretty well
*  organized in the weeks leading up to the shooting.
*  He made a lot of online purchases.
*  He bought fertilizer in pellet form and some fuel for an explosive.
*  And then he crammed them all into an empty ammunition canister and made what authorities
*  say was a rudimentary explosive device.
*  He also bought some remote controls that are pretty commonly found on the Internet that
*  are used to operate fireworks.
*  So he seems to have been trying to do some sort of remote control explosive.
*  Then on July 7th, basically a week before the shooting and just a few days after the
*  Trump rally was announced publicly, he seems to have traveled up to Butler to suss out
*  the site, according to geolocation data that the FBI obtained from his cell phones.
*  Sometime before the shooting, he goes into his job at a nursing home, which is located
*  actually within walking distance from his house, and he's working as a kitchen aide
*  there.
*  And he asks his bosses for the Saturday of the Trump rally off, and he tells them nothing
*  other than he has something important that he wants to do.
*  A day before the shooting, he apparently takes one of the guns from his dad's collection
*  which was not that uncommon in his household, according to law enforcement officials, and
*  he goes to the shooting range.
*  The morning of the shooting, he goes to a local gun shop and he buys somewhere between
*  50 and 100 rounds of semi-automatic ammunition.
*  And at some point, we don't know if it was before or after that, he drives up to the
*  rally site one more time to scope it out.
*  But this time, and this is where it gets really extraordinary, he brings with him a gun that
*  he essentially uses to fly a preprogrammed path so that he can survey with some specificity
*  what the layout of the site is.
*  And it was a little after 5 p.m. on Saturday when local law enforcement observed a young
*  man with stringy hair milling around the perimeter of the rally and they identified him as being
*  suspicious.
*  So based on everything we've learned about Crooks and about how the shooting happened,
*  he was intentional, of course, but he still doesn't seem like someone who actually has
*  the profile of a political assassin.
*  Yeah, with the caveat that investigators might find some connection, he looks a lot like
*  the alienated young men that have been responsible for school shootings and other mass
*  shootings.
*  He spent a lot of time alone and online.
*  He had developed by being online phenomenal technical expertise.
*  There is something very 21st century about this.
*  In many of these shootings, we've learned to accept some level of ambiguity.
*  It's less about finding one cut and dried motive than a set of circumstances in a person's
*  life.
*  And I think that's where we're headed on this one.
*  Glenn, one of the things that's so striking to me is that because we don't have any real
*  answers here about why he did this, that has sort of created this blank canvas for anybody
*  to paint their own picture, like to derive their own meaning for this event because Crooks
*  didn't give us one.
*  Yeah, and we've seen all kinds of conspiracy theories floating around and people have also
*  made up political motives, even though the FBI has told us time and again that they haven't
*  found any evidence of that.
*  Sometimes they fabricated them.
*  Sometimes they've imputed these motives.
*  But look, just because we don't have a motive doesn't mean there isn't a meaning.
*  And from the moment he realized he'd been hit, you can see it on the video, Trump understood
*  the political benefits of this situation.
*  It came the week before the Republican National Convention, and it fed a storyline that
*  Republicans have been saying about Donald Trump since he got into politics, that Trump was a
*  fighter, that he was a survivor, that he represented the American spirit.
*  But it also added a new one, that Trump was somehow blessed, that he was protected by God
*  and Providence.
*  And it lent the candidacy and elevation it had never had before.
*  We don't know how long it's going to last, but for a week, Republicans had a different,
*  more dignified Donald Trump who had just been through the fire.
*  Glenn, thank you.
*  Thank you.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what else you should know today.
*  On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris secured enough state convention delegates to become the
*  Democratic presidential nominee.
*  The Times reports that her state party endorsements now represent about 80 percent of the nearly
*  4,000 delegates who will vote on the first ballot at the party convention.
*  She also picked up two more influential endorsements from the two top Democrats in Congress,
*  Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakim Jeffries.
*  They said they waited to endorse her until after she had enough delegates to win the
*  nomination.
*  As the momentum built around Harris as the potential candidate,
*  she flew to Wisconsin to officially kick off her presidential campaign.
*  Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom.
*  And now Wisconsin, the baton is in our hands.
*  And after weeks of speculation, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey said he plans to resign
*  from the Senate in late August, bowing to intense pressure from his Democratic colleagues
*  who had pushed him to step down after he was convicted of taking bribes and acting as a
*  foreign agent.
*  Menendez's resignation spared his party from what would have been an ugly fight to oust
*  him at a time when it was trying to refocus all of its energy on retaining the White House
*  and the Senate.
