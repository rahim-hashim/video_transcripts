# Republicans Have Become the 'Party of Disruption'
**New York Times - The Daily:** [November 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A)
*  I just want to make sure I understand what I think you're all hinting at, which is that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and the Republican Party have completed a journey in which they are the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=3.2s)]
*  party of disruption. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=7.44s)]
*  They are the party that assaults the establishment. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  They are the party that says not just to the white working class, but to the working class [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=12.52s)]
*  in a number of different demographic groups, including black and Latino working class Americans, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=16.92s)]
*  that we are your refuge from an unfair, broken system. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=23.48s)]
*  And I would only add their ability to do that was made easier by a Democratic Party who [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=28.44s)]
*  seated the mantle on that front. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=33.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=36.24s)]
*  The biggest character in this race to me was not on the ballot in 2020. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=37.24s)]
*  It was Joe Biden, in my opinion. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=41.0s)]
*  Like, Joe Biden's refusal to do what he implied he would do in 2020 and transition to a different [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=43.160000000000004s)]
*  type of generation, allow Democrats to have a broader conversation about change, allow [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=49.44s)]
*  Democrats to be freed from the status quo, is not what happened. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=53.8s)]
*  I think it would be easier for me to say that Donald Trump completed this mass realignment [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=58.28s)]
*  among the working class if we had a universe where the Democrats had a primary, where the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Democrats nominated a candidate that was based around some set of ideas and it was not tied [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=67.92s)]
*  to this image in this administration so clearly and the status quo. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=73.08s)]
*  But since that is not what happened, I think it has made the Republican ability to be the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  agents of change so much easier that I find it the biggest thing that has happened in [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=81.84s)]
*  this race. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=87.04s)]
*  So what we're saying about what's happened over the last three months, the place that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=88.36s)]
*  they were in before the candidate switch happened made it such that you could run a perfect [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  race or whatever and you are still playing on ground that brings you to 50-50 because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=97.0s)]
*  the biggest thing, in my opinion, that happened was they tied themselves to an unpopular administration [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=102.36000000000001s)]
*  and with it the status quo. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=107.64000000000001s)]
*  That did not represent change. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  And there was a lot of evidence that that was a bad idea. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6z2ZK453A&t=110.52000000000001s)]
