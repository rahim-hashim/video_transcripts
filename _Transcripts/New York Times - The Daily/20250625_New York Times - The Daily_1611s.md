# Will the Cease-Fire Hold?
**New York Times - The Daily:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams, and this is The Daily. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=0.0s)]
*  After President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, all sides [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  are claiming victory. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=19.84s)]
*  But perhaps no country has emerged as a bigger winner than Israel. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=21.88s)]
*  Today, my colleague Patrick Kingsley explains how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu helped [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=26.56s)]
*  to steer events to this moment, and what might come next if a ceasefire holds. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=32.8s)]
*  It's Wednesday, June 25th. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=48.12s)]
*  So Patrick, early this morning, President Trump was furious that Iran and Israel had [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=57.2s)]
*  continued to attack each other in the hours before the ceasefire that Trump very proudly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=62.0s)]
*  announced was supposed to take effect. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=67.08s)]
*  The president even said, they don't know what the blank they're doing, but he used a word [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=69.16s)]
*  that rhymes with schmuck. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=73.12s)]
*  And what he was really angry about, it seemed, was Israel. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Specifically, he did not want Israel to continue dropping more bombs. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=78.28s)]
*  He basically said or demanded that they were going to turn their fighter jets around. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=83.32s)]
*  And so I think the question on everybody's mind right now is, will the ceasefire actually [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=88.4s)]
*  hold? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=93.92s)]
*  You never know with a ceasefire, particularly in its opening stages, these arrangements [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=95.76s)]
*  can always break down and they can sometimes result in short spasms of violence before [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=100.08s)]
*  returning to calm. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=106.92s)]
*  But as we're talking on Tuesday night here in Jerusalem and 2 p.m. Eastern time over [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=108.24s)]
*  where you are, it does seem to be holding. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=115.52s)]
*  The Israeli military issued an announcement a short while ago in which they said life [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=118.0s)]
*  could return to normal in Israel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=124.52000000000001s)]
*  And that's a sign that the Israeli security establishment no longer think that Iran is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=127.76s)]
*  on the verge of firing missiles into Israeli civilian areas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=132.68s)]
*  Can you tell us a little bit about how this deal came about? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=137.84s)]
*  Our colleague Maggie Haberman reported that even some of Trump's closest advisors were [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  caught off guard by his announcement last night. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=144.52s)]
*  Well, everything happened in fast forward from roundabout Sunday morning onward. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=148.16s)]
*  President Trump ordered U.S. planes to bomb three key nuclear sites that Israel had not [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  been able to destroy. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=160.72s)]
*  On Monday, Iran essentially decided to de-escalate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=164.28s)]
*  Instead of firing lots of missiles at lots of different American air bases and interests [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=169.08s)]
*  across the Middle East, they fired simply at one U.S. military base in Qatar, which [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=175.76s)]
*  was seen as a kind of signal that Iran wanted to respond in a somewhat token way. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=184.24s)]
*  And then President Trump suddenly announced that he had brokered a deal between Israel [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=191.88s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=199.44s)]
*  The deal is a little bit murky. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=200.88s)]
*  We're not quite sure how it came about, but we do know from other reporting by my colleague [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=202.84s)]
*  here at Arascon that the leadership of Qatar was essential to communicating between Israel [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=207.4s)]
*  and Iran. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=214.92s)]
*  And within hours, the Iranians said that they were on board with this plan. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=216.68s)]
*  The air was still silent and both sides continued to strike each other. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  But then as the morning wore on, not much more than 12 hours after Iran had struck the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=225.4s)]
*  American air base, the fighting seemed to subside. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=231.2s)]
*  And by mid-morning, the Israeli government had announced that they too were party to [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=236.0s)]
*  this deal. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  And barring another attack or two from either side, the ceasefire has since held. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=242.51999999999998s)]
*  It's all happened in surprisingly quick time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=250.4s)]
*  We've gone from being in a situation on Saturday night where we were braced for the outbreak [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=253.44s)]
*  of a much broader conflict involving the U.S. across the Middle East to a situation where [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=258.68s)]
*  the Israel-Iran war of 2025 has been contained to just 12 days. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=264.88s)]
*  Now it was still very deadly. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=272.28s)]
*  In Iran, more than 600 people were reported dead. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=274.92s)]
*  In Israel, up to 30. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=278.92s)]
*  But the bloodshed still came to an end much more quickly than some had feared. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=282.16s)]
*  That 180-degree turn that you described really is just so stark. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=287.16s)]
*  The fact that we went from the possibility of this wider war to a ceasefire in just a [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  couple days, it does make me wonder about Israel in all of this because they were the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  ones who were lobbying for U.S. involvement for months. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=302.92s)]
*  What have they gained in all of this? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=307.0s)]
*  In truth, Israel is the biggest winner. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=309.24s)]
*  For years, Israel perceived Iran as the biggest threat to its long-term future. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  And Netanyahu had made his life's goal to launch a military attack on Iran big enough [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=317.8s)]
*  to set back its military capabilities and its nuclear program, and in particular, its [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=325.06s)]
*  missile program. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=331.0s)]
*  Now we've just seen an early report from several of our colleagues that an initial assessment [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=333.12s)]
*  by the U.S. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=340.8s)]
*  government says that the Israeli and American strikes may have only set back Iran's nuclear [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=341.8s)]
*  program by less than six months. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=347.54s)]
*  But nevertheless, Iran's program is in a worse state than it was two weeks ago. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=350.64s)]
*  Clearly, some nuclear sites have been damaged. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=358.04s)]
*  Iran no longer seems to have the ability to fire huge barrages of ballistic missiles at [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=362.6s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=368.6s)]
*  So the optics of this remain that this is a big win for Israel, even if we're uncertain [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=370.0s)]
*  about the exact nature of the details of that win. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=377.52s)]
*  And in particular, it's a big win for Netanyahu, who, if we remember, at the start of the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=382.28s)]
*  war with Hamas back in October 2023, was facing political oblivion. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=387.76s)]
*  He was seen in Israel as a man who had presided over the worst military catastrophe in Israeli [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=394.79999999999995s)]
*  history. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=401.4s)]
*  And yet now, he can claim, following the Iran campaign, to be the architect of one of Israel's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  greatest military victories. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=411.04s)]
*  So how did Netanyahu, in fact, pull all of this off? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=413.88s)]
*  It's a combination of his long-held ambition, a sequence of unforeseen events, and then, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=418.08s)]
*  as time went on, a series of decisions by both Netanyahu and his military leaders that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=425.56s)]
*  allowed him to get to this point. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=433.52s)]
*  The timeline arguably starts on October 7, when Hamas, which is an ally of Iran, surprised [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=435.8s)]
*  Israel with the deadliest attack in Israel's history. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=446.88s)]
*  And Netanyahu was at the helm on that day. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=451.8s)]
*  And that ruined his credentials in the eyes of many Israelis. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=455.44s)]
*  He and his party plummeted in the opinion polls, and he was at a kind of political nadir. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=460.76s)]
*  Because people blamed him for this attack. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=469.96s)]
*  At least in part. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=472.03999999999996s)]
*  He was blamed along with the leaders of Israel's security establishment. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=473.2s)]
*  And it seemed like this was close to the end of his political career. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=478.59999999999997s)]
*  But then, as time goes on, the war against Hamas evolves into a slightly wider war against [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=484.72s)]
*  Hamas and its regional allies. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=494.6s)]
*  And that leads to a series of decisive confrontations in the second half of last year, 2024, that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  essentially allowed Israel, if not to entirely defeat Hamas's ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=509.76000000000005s)]
*  to assassinate its top leadership, severely weaken its military capabilities, and force [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  it back from the Israeli border. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=522.36s)]
*  And that also had a knock-on effect in Syria. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=525.88s)]
*  It meant the Syrian government, which wasn't a key ally of Iran, collapsed under pressure [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=529.44s)]
*  from rebel groups in Syria. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=537.1600000000001s)]
*  And it did so in part because Iran and Hezbollah could no longer come to its aid because they [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=539.64s)]
*  were substantially weakened by this growing conflict. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=544.52s)]
*  And that in turn sucked Israel and Iran into a more direct confrontation. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=550.04s)]
*  They had been fighting what we call a shadow war, where mostly they were attacking each [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=556.64s)]
*  other through secret and unannounced attacks, sometimes cyber attacks, sometimes assassinations. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=561.6s)]
*  And that all broke out into the open as a result of this war with Hamas developing into [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=568.38s)]
*  a more intense regional conflict throughout the course of 2024. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=574.2s)]
*  And so we enter 2025 in a situation that Israelis, by and large, could not have imagined at the [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=578.5s)]
*  start of this war. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=586.42s)]
*  Instead of being humiliated by Hamas, suddenly Israel was increasingly dominant. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=588.54s)]
*  And that created what many Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu, thought was a window [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=595.76s)]
*  of opportunity in which Iran was historically weakened and unable to likely rely on its [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=601.28s)]
*  network of regional proxies and allies to come to its rescue in the event of a massive [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=609.0s)]
*  Israeli attack. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=615.36s)]
*  And Netanyahu and the Israeli military leadership began planning for such a massive attack. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=617.42s)]
*  Okay, Patrick, just to make sure I have this right, it sounds like this is a story of Israel [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  having this ambition for a very long time to take out Iran and its allies. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  But it has not been in a position to do this because of this risk of a wider war that certainly [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=632.84s)]
*  the United States has been worried about. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=638.58s)]
*  But that risk of a wider war now does not look as great as it has been all these years [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=640.98s)]
*  because of all the different conditions that you described. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=646.82s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=649.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=651.0600000000001s)]
*  And if we want to add an extra factor into what made all this come together, it was the [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=652.0600000000001s)]
*  effect of October 7th on the Israeli psyche. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=658.46s)]
*  To critics of Israel, October 7th was caused in part because Israel did not end its occupation [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=664.1s)]
*  of the West Bank or its blockade of Gaza. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=671.5s)]
*  And there was an eruption in response to that. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=675.3000000000001s)]
*  For many Israelis, they've concluded the opposite, that October 7th happened because Israel allowed [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=678.46s)]
*  a threat, Hamas, to grow in strength along its borders and Israel did not do anything [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=686.46s)]
*  about it soon enough. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=693.58s)]
*  And so the lesson that many Israelis have learned from that is that they need to act [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=695.86s)]
*  preemptively and decisively in order to take out such a threat. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=700.1s)]
*  And we've seen that. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=704.9000000000001s)]
*  First of all, with Hamas in Gaza, but also with Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=706.5s)]
*  And now with Iran. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=712.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=714.1s)]
*  And what made all of this also come together was the arrival in the White House of President [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=715.34s)]
*  Trump, who despite making contradictory statements over the last weeks and months has become [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=723.34s)]
*  a crucial partner in Netanyahu's and Israel's campaign in Iran over the last 12 days. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=733.02s)]
*  And to be clear, Trump's support in this war was never actually a given until literally [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=740.5799999999999s)]
*  the bombs were dropping. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=746.34s)]
*  Their relationship has blown hot and cold, but he set about from very early on in Trump's [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=748.5s)]
*  presidency, even as Trump was signaling that he wanted to negotiate with Iran in order [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=753.66s)]
*  to get Iran to limit its nuclear ambitions. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=758.8199999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu was trying to get Trump to back his military ambitions against Iran and back [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=762.02s)]
*  his vision of destroying Iran's nuclear program, not through diplomacy, but by military force. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=769.86s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=776.8199999999999s)]
*  Our colleague Jonathan Swan told us this whole backstory of Netanyahu coming to the White [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=777.8199999999999s)]
*  House. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=781.62s)]
*  He insists that Iran is very, very close to getting a weapon closer than they've been [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=782.62s)]
*  in recent times. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=785.74s)]
*  And Trump is still not convinced that force is the answer. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=787.78s)]
*  He still wants to try diplomacy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=790.84s)]
*  And Netanyahu argues that the only way that diplomacy is going to work is if Trump shows [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=793.12s)]
*  some force. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=796.72s)]
*  And Trump is still not buying it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=797.94s)]
*  He says diplomacy first, but gets increasingly frustrated when Iran seems like it's not actually [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=799.48s)]
*  very serious about making a deal. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=805.26s)]
*  And as we know, Israel just attacks anyway. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  They let the United States know they're going to go it alone with her or without US help. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=810.1600000000001s)]
*  But Netanyahu seems to have made a very strategic bet that Trump would eventually give Israel [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=814.02s)]
*  the support that it would need, which of course is what happens. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=820.68s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=823.92s)]
*  So to drag in President Trump and the United States Air Force into its attack was an incredible [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=825.9599999999999s)]
*  coup for Netanyahu. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=832.7199999999999s)]
*  When Israel did attack on June 13th, they didn't know whether Trump or the American [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=839.0s)]
*  Air Force would join them. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=846.3s)]
*  They did eventually some eight or nine days later. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=848.64s)]
*  And that was, in hindsight, what allowed the war to end. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=852.64s)]
*  It allowed Israel to feel that it had achieved its main objective, the strike on Fordow. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=856.1999999999999s)]
*  It then brought about an endgame where Iran fired back against the American airbase in [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=861.8s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=867.8199999999999s)]
*  And that then created a situation in which all sides could de-escalate. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=869.4s)]
*  So this feels like a huge victory for Israel and a huge moment, even if we don't quite [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=879.64s)]
*  know the scale of that victory or what exactly will happen next. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=887.72s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=905.4399999999999s)]
*  So, Patrick, I want to talk to you about what happens next here, because it seems like [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=908.64s)]
*  both President Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are assuming that these attacks go a long [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=916.3199999999999s)]
*  way to set Iran's nuclear program back, which has been the stated ambition of Israel for [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=921.8s)]
*  a very long time. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=925.76s)]
*  Do we think here, though, that the point for the United States and maybe also Israel is [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=927.9s)]
*  to get Iran to make a nuclear deal? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=933.3199999999999s)]
*  My impression has been that that's what the United States wants, but that's not what Israel [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=936.1600000000001s)]
*  has been wanting out of this. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=940.46s)]
*  I think there's a lot of nuance here. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=942.2s)]
*  Maybe the best place to start is to remember that when an American president, Barack Obama, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=944.36s)]
*  last tried to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran that limited Iran's nuclear program, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=951.6s)]
*  Israel was fundamentally opposed to it because in essence, they said it did too little to [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=959.96s)]
*  limit that nuclear program and did too little to limit its regional ambitions. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=966.64s)]
*  Now there's a world in which Israel is less resistant to it, a new deal brokered by President [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=974.2800000000001s)]
*  Trump. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  So just hypothetically, a deal between the United States and Iran would be easier if [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=981.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel wasn't objecting to it, right? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  And we don't actually know whether Iran is going to come to the table and negotiate with [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=990.0799999999999s)]
*  the United States, but there is a scenario in which they do. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=993.56s)]
*  And if those talks did lead to a deal, that would seem to make it true what Netanyahu [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  had told Trump when he met with him months ago, which is that diplomacy is only going [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1005.3599999999999s)]
*  to work with a show of force. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1010.38s)]
*  I think you can argue it both ways, depending on your perspective. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1012.7199999999999s)]
*  On the one hand, it could be that having been reduced to a position of greater weakness [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1017.54s)]
*  by this 12-day war, Iran feels too scared to continue its nuclear program or in fact [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1024.7s)]
*  galvanized to accelerate even faster towards a nuclear weapon, precisely because it feels [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1032.74s)]
*  it has not got very much time to do so before perhaps a future Israeli attack and it wants [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1041.54s)]
*  to create an insurance policy against future aggression by creating the very thing that [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1048.22s)]
*  Israel had wanted to prevent it from getting its hands on in the first place. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1056.26s)]
*  It sounds like what you're saying is that two possible scenarios are diametrically opposed [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1060.74s)]
*  to one another. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1065.26s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen, but it is possible that what has transpired over [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1066.26s)]
*  the past week and a half or so has brought the U.S. closer to a deal with Iran. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1070.26s)]
*  And another scenario is that it is possible that what's happened has made it much, much [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1074.34s)]
*  harder to get a deal. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1078.42s)]
*  Both those things are possible. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1080.3799999999999s)]
*  Time will tell. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1082.14s)]
*  Patrick, can we just talk about one of these scenarios, this idea that none of this leads [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1083.14s)]
*  to a deal? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1087.78s)]
*  In that situation, could Israel even call this whole operation a victory? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1089.12s)]
*  Well, fundamentally, Israel fears a nuclear Iran. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1094.14s)]
*  And if it sees that Iran actually has not been set back hugely by this 12-day war, the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1098.14s)]
*  possibility arises that they will attack again and again and again if necessary. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1104.46s)]
*  What they've done in these last 12 days is to break Israel's fear barrier about attacking [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1110.26s)]
*  Iran. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1116.7s)]
*  The challenge for Israel in resuming such attacks on Iran is that they are immensely [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1117.74s)]
*  the Israeli economy and an immense strain on Israel's air defense system. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1125.54s)]
*  Israel has only a finite amount of missile interceptors. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1132.6599999999999s)]
*  And the longer a conflict with Iran goes on, the more missiles Iran fires, the more interceptors [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1137.06s)]
*  Israel must fire in response, and the greater the risk that a missile is going to slip through [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1143.1399999999999s)]
*  and cause a mass casualty event. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1149.74s)]
*  These are all factors that may limit Israel's future ambitions of striking Iran's nuclear [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1154.3s)]
*  program, even if it does turn out that those nuclear sites have sustained less damage than [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1162.02s)]
*  Israel and the U.S. previously said. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1168.7399999999998s)]
*  I'm a little bit surprised, Patrick, that when you were talking about the limitations [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1170.9399999999998s)]
*  of Israel's military capabilities to attack Iran, you didn't mention the other front of [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1175.5s)]
*  this conflict, which of course is happening in Gaza, where Israel has been waging this [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1181.86s)]
*  war against Hamas for the past 20 months or so. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1186.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm just wondering how what happened in Iran over the past 12 days affects the war in Gaza. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1189.3s)]
*  There's now growing expectation that actually there could be a knock-on effect in Gaza as [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1196.8999999999999s)]
*  a result of all that's been going on in Iran in recent days. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1204.1s)]
*  Whatever the final assessment of the Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear program, it is still [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1209.74s)]
*  perceived as a big victory in Israel for Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1217.26s)]
*  He is now seen as the prime minister that dared to take the fight to Israel's biggest [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1222.74s)]
*  enemy, Iran, and that seems to have boosted his confidence. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1230.1s)]
*  Some polling suggests it has put him in one of his strongest positions since the start [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1235.74s)]
*  of the war in Gaza in October 2023, and analysts and allies of Netanyahu are saying that this [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1240.9s)]
*  now gives him a bit more room for political maneuver to potentially make a deal that ends [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1251.54s)]
*  the war in Gaza. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1259.26s)]
*  We're still several steps away from that, but if he has increased his popularity, it [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1261.14s)]
*  could allow him to be more flexible in the negotiations over the future of the Gaza war [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1268.38s)]
*  because he is now less beholden to hardliners in his coalition who have threatened to collapse [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1276.22s)]
*  his government and send it to early elections that previously Netanyahu risked losing. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1283.5s)]
*  Now he stands a fighting chance of winning a future election, which means that he's potentially [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1292.26s)]
*  less worried about making a move in Gaza that leads to the collapse of his coalition government. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1297.94s)]
*  And that's why people think that in the coming weeks we could be moving towards an endgame [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1305.66s)]
*  in Gaza just as we've reached an endgame in Iran. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1310.34s)]
*  Okay, so because the war with Iran makes him more popular, Netanyahu is not as reliant [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1314.62s)]
*  on this hard right group that he has needed up until now and had insisted on him continuing [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1320.6999999999998s)]
*  the war in Gaza and been very reluctant for a deal. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1326.4599999999998s)]
*  And what you are saying is that now he has more ability to kind of ignore the far right [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1329.6599999999999s)]
*  Because he has other constituencies that like him now that he might be able to build off of. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1336.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes, because he's taken a big step that many Israelis, even his critics, have applauded, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1340.9399999999998s)]
*  that may mean that he stands a better chance of winning a snap election if his government [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1351.2199999999998s)]
*  does collapse. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1357.9799999999998s)]
*  Of course, all of this is still in the realms of the hypothetical and we don't quite know [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1359.7s)]
*  how things are going to play out. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1366.5s)]
*  But certainly the mood in Israel on Tuesday was one of greater optimism about the sense [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1368.5s)]
*  that there could be a truce that would release the dozens of hostages, both dead and alive, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1376.26s)]
*  who are still held in Gaza. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1382.7s)]
*  In a way, it sounds like regardless of the outcome in Gaza, Netanyahu has actually managed [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1386.1000000000001s)]
*  to turn the tide of at least a significant portion of domestic public opinion in favor [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1391.9s)]
*  of him and what he's doing with Iran. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1397.3s)]
*  And he's been able to rally a certain amount of support behind him at a time when maybe [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1400.18s)]
*  that support was kind of waning because of what was happening in Gaza. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1405.3s)]
*  And that kind of political machination, it makes me understand sort of how he's held [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1409.7s)]
*  onto power for so long. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1415.1s)]
*  I think what we've seen in the last few weeks is Netanyahu at his peak as a mover and shaker, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1417.3799999999999s)]
*  as a politician, and he's ended up at this point in an infinitely stronger position than [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1423.9399999999998s)]
*  he was at the start of this long 20-month crisis in October 2023. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1430.02s)]
*  So we see a prime minister who has perhaps achieved one of the greatest political comebacks [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1438.3s)]
*  in the history of Israel, if not the wider region. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1445.8999999999999s)]
*  This came about not through intricate and well-thought-out planning over the past 20 [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1453.5s)]
*  months. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1460.82s)]
*  It came about because of incremental and in some cases fortunate developments that were [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1461.82s)]
*  beyond Netanyahu's control and that he simply took best advantage of as time went on. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1467.74s)]
*  And the sum total of both those unforeseen events and Netanyahu's ability to take advantage [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1476.38s)]
*  of those events has led us to where we are today. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1484.6200000000001s)]

*  In the closely watched Democratic primary for mayor of New York City, Zoran Mamdani, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1518.7s)]
*  a 33-year-old Democratic socialist, has taken a major lead over former governor Andrew Cuomo, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1523.58s)]

*  touched young people. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1543.98s)]
*  The winner of the race may not be official for days, but what's clear is that at a time [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1544.98s)]
*  when national Democrats are struggling to find a message, Mamdani's unabashedly left-wing [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPnwi54b1_g&t=1549.82s)]
