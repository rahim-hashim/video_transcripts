# 100 Days
**New York Times - The Daily:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  On Tuesday, the second Trump presidency officially reached the 100-day mark. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  One hundred days of transformation, tariffs, retribution, firings, and deportations, the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=19.44s)]
*  likes of which America has never before seen. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=27.92s)]
*  Today, I asked three of my colleagues, Maggie Haverman, Jonathan Swan, and Charlie Savage, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=32.96s)]
*  to assess that record. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=41.28s)]
*  It's Wednesday, April 30th. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=46.88s)]
*  Maggie, Jonathan, Charlie, welcome back. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=50.88s)]
*  It's been a while. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Michael, for having us. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  Great to be back. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=59.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=60.32s)]
*  That's what you've got, Charlie. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=61.32s)]
*  Yup. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  Charlie, welcome back. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=64.52s)]
*  Thanks for having us back. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=67.24s)]
*  We're talking to you all on Tuesday, which is, although there's been a little bit of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=68.96s)]
*  dispute on our team, the 100th day of the Trump second term. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=73.84s)]
*  And I want to start with a very basic question of why it is we talk so much about the first [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=79.6s)]
*  hundred days. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=85.52s)]
*  It's a totally artificial metric, as anyone in the Trump administration will tell you, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=87.02s)]
*  even as they are touting it and looking at it because they know other people are. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=92.16s)]
*  It is how presidents, for a while now, have measured the success of their agenda, how [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=95.94s)]
*  much have they accomplished in that period of time. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=102.22s)]
*  And it's a way to compare apples to apples to what previous presidents have done. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=104.42s)]
*  I don't want to be like the Australian talking about American history here, but obviously- [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=108.78s)]
*  But here you are- [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=113.1s)]
*  Go on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=114.1s)]
*  I mean, obviously the benchmark is FDR's first hundred days where he pushed, I think it was [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=115.1s)]
*  15 major bills through Congress and created a legacy that we still live with. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  So ever since then, presidents have used this, as Maggie said, artificial construct to measure [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=126.38s)]
*  their self-worth at an early point in the administration. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=133.5s)]
*  Charlie? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, picking up on this and also the historical origins of it, there is one thing that isn't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=138.01999999999998s)]
*  apples to apples here, which is the term first hundred days is coined by Roosevelt, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=143.06s)]
*  but he wasn't actually referring to, as I understand it, his first hundred days. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=147.66s)]
*  He had called Congress back into session after he was inaugurated for a special session to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=152.18s)]
*  pass all these new deal bills, and he was referring to the first hundred days of that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=157.38s)]
*  Congress. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=162.02s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=163.02s)]
*  And the accomplishments were 15 hugely important laws that created the huge pillars of getting [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=164.02s)]
*  the country back on its feet in the middle of the Great Depression through Congress. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=171.5s)]
*  And it's remarkable that even with Republican control of both chambers of Congress here, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=177.5s)]
*  Trump's first hundred days of his presidency has resulted in zero major bills. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=184.5s)]
*  So that was all prelude to me explaining why we are bringing this August trio back, I think [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=191.38s)]
*  for the third time on the show, which is that you were the group that prepared us for the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=198.7s)]
*  second Trump term, in theory, before it actually became a reality, by doing a tremendous amount [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=205.9s)]
*  of reporting about what his plan was for 2.0. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=210.82s)]
*  And so now that Trump's agenda has been rolled out, we want to assess this administration [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=215.18s)]
*  on a few metrics. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=219.46s)]
*  And let me just spell out a couple of those. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=220.9s)]
*  Firstly, you had told us that much more than in the first term, the second Trump term would [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=222.7s)]
*  be more thought through. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=227.82s)]
*  If there was going to be a master plan, it was going to be the second term. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=230.3s)]
*  So has this administration stuck to that plan or have things veered off into something more [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=233.5s)]
*  haphazard? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=238.18s)]
*  Secondly, have the administration's approaches, whether they've been planned well or not, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=239.18s)]
*  succeeded or failed? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=244.38s)]
*  Finally, what does this administration, based on your reporting, make of the public reaction [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=246.42000000000002s)]
*  to what it's done so far? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=251.78s)]
*  As our colleague Nate Cohn told us a couple days ago, most Americans think this White [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=253.14s)]
*  House has gone too far and they think things have been disorganized. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=256.94s)]
*  So with that three part framework in mind, where do you think we should start? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's a million places you could start, but if you just look at the series of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=268.41999999999996s)]
*  reporting that we laid out, the first big element that we talked about was expansion [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=272.14s)]
*  of power and destruction of or elimination of any pocket of independence [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=277.06s)]
*  within the executive branch. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=282.85999999999996s)]
*  I would put a big tick next to that one, maybe even a double tick. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  He's clearly done that, firing checks on his power, getting rid of inspectors [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=288.86s)]
*  general and other elements within the executive branch. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=295.06s)]
*  Another element, obviously, that we reported on in depth was immigration. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=298.54s)]
*  I think we can talk about that later, but it's, I would say, a very mixed scorecard. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=301.7s)]
*  Well, let's talk about it now. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=305.82s)]
*  They've effectively started to do what they plan to do. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=307.26s)]
*  It just in at least one half of their program isn't going so well. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=310.66s)]
*  So the first half, sealing the border tick record low border crossings. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=315.02000000000004s)]
*  They've absolutely achieved that in a very short space of time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=319.74s)]
*  If you talk to people internally, they're almost, I'm not going to say frustrated by [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=323.54s)]
*  their success, but it almost came too quickly, too easily. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, so now they're sort of, well, we need to send the troops down there. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=329.98s)]
*  And it's like, okay, but no one's really coming across. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=334.06s)]
*  But the second part of the immigration agenda that has been far less successful [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=337.86s)]
*  is interior deportations, removing people from the country. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=341.62s)]
*  And in that sense, the numbers are nothing like what they said they would be. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=346.18s)]
*  So far, they promised the biggest deportation operation in American history, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=350.02s)]
*  deporting millions of people every year. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=355.02s)]
*  They're nowhere near on track to do that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=357.1s)]
*  And of course, very widely reported. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=359.26s)]
*  They are jettisoning due process and sending people to prison for terrorists in El [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=362.42s)]
*  Salvador. At least one person sent there by mistake. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=368.94000000000005s)]
*  They're running into a battle with the courts. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=372.54s)]
*  So that side of the immigration agenda is very messy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=375.06s)]
*  Can I talk about the second part? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=378.82000000000005s)]
*  Because I think we can all agree that sealing the border and bringing down [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=380.54s)]
*  crossings, they have achieved that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=385.98s)]
*  But let's talk about why the administration is pursuing this very controversial [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=388.18s)]
*  approach of deporting undocumented immigrants without due process, as you [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=391.46s)]
*  mentioned, Jonathan, because from everything our polling has been telling us, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=396.5s)]
*  that is not popular. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=401.82s)]
*  And I wonder why the White House thinks it's necessary. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=403.46s)]
*  What is it accomplishing? And was it ever part of an original plan? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=406.06s)]
*  It depends on who you talk to about how extensively the planning was for this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=409.38s)]
*  But I think that there have been aspects of this in the minds of some of Trump's [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=413.06s)]
*  advisers for some time. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=416.06s)]
*  Part of why they're doing it is it is a deterrent. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  It is essentially we are going to move fast. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=420.14s)]
*  We are going to move on what we think is our authority. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=422.74s)]
*  And if you talk to the Trump folks, they will tell you they like their chances with [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=425.02s)]
*  the court. In their minds, they think that it is going to be very hard for the Supreme [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=429.14s)]
*  Court to say no to them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=433.34s)]
*  Now, we'll see if that's true. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=434.58s)]
*  But in the mind of the Trump White House, this is still telling people who want to [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  come here illegally, don't come. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=440.62s)]
*  We're going to make things difficult for you, especially at a time when they are [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=442.85999999999996s)]
*  not having these mass roundups of migrants that they have been predicting. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=446.1s)]
*  And which they promised. Correct. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=450.98s)]
*  I think the problem they're encountering is that the normal process for [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=452.9s)]
*  deporting someone who's here illegally involves due process. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=458.5s)]
*  It just takes a long time and they don't have enough personnel to do this. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=462.66s)]
*  So Trump is still deporting more or less the same number of people, actually slightly [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=468.06s)]
*  less, I think, than Biden was. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=472.18s)]
*  And they are frustrated by that. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=473.94s)]
*  And a lot of the stuff that they've been doing, expanding Guantanamo as a place to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=476.65999999999997s)]
*  send migrants or now this prison in El Salvador makes no sense on its face. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=481.26s)]
*  It's expensive. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=488.14s)]
*  It's getting them flack in the courts. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  It's not resonating with the public. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=492.1s)]
*  But in particular, they want the headlines about cruelty because they're hoping that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=494.1s)]
*  huge numbers of people will simply go home on their own steam and then they can take [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=499.98s)]
*  credit for that. You know, you're talking about administration where Stephen Miller, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=504.42s)]
*  who was the architect of Trump's immigration proposals, is, as many administration [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=508.3s)]
*  officials will tell you, living his best life. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=513.46s)]
*  He's very happy. He is enacting the policies that he wanted to see for a very long time. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=515.1800000000001s)]
*  They are at risk of making mistakes and have made some mistakes that will come back to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=520.7s)]
*  haunt them. One is Abrego Garcia, Tel-Savador. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=524.58s)]
*  The other is some deportations of children who were sick last week. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=527.3399999999999s)]
*  One had cancer. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=531.38s)]
*  Very advanced cancer and was deported without medicine. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=532.18s)]
*  And so those were the kind of headlines that actually were a problem for Donald Trump in [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=535.02s)]
*  Term 1, specifically family separation policies. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=539.06s)]
*  That was a huge debacle for the administration. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=542.78s)]
*  And I wonder, are we approaching with some of these deportations, especially of children, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=544.8599999999999s)]
*  something akin to the moment in Term 1 that feels like child separation, something that [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=550.14s)]
*  is beyond the pale for many people in the public? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=556.42s)]
*  And as I recall it, Trump eventually signs an executive order saying, oh, right, I'm [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=558.38s)]
*  going to ban those child separations. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=562.78s)]
*  Those are not right. He sort of acted like it was something out of his control and he [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=564.66s)]
*  wanted to end it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=567.9799999999999s)]
*  Right. But what got to that point was a broad public outrage and an outcry from a lot of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=568.66s)]
*  elected officials. And we are seeing that to some extent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=573.5s)]
*  But information doesn't break through in this media ecosystem the way it did even six [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=576.6999999999999s)]
*  years ago, seven years ago. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=581.98s)]
*  And so I don't know that it'll matter the same way. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=583.5s)]
*  I can't speak for everyone in the White House, but for the vast majority of them, any day [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=586.02s)]
*  that the public conversation is about immigration is a good day. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=590.74s)]
*  Anytime they're in trouble, like when their tariff strategy is causing huge anxiety in [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=594.82s)]
*  the public, the markets to crash, their safe space, their North Star is immigration. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=600.7s)]
*  And the playbook is the same. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=606.26s)]
*  Wheel out photographs of the most heinous criminals, put out the most graphic, lurid [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=607.98s)]
*  stories of illegal immigrants doing awful things to American citizens. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=613.1s)]
*  And I would say the majority opinion and certainly Trump's own instincts are that, you [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=618.4200000000001s)]
*  know, immigration is a winning issue. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=623.4200000000001s)]
*  Whenever we can talk about immigration, we're winning. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=626.0600000000001s)]
*  This is making me think about the other portrayed villains by this administration. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=629.1800000000001s)]
*  And those would be elite universities, big law firms, and some individual enemies of [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=636.78s)]
*  the president who he has pursued with extraordinary alacrity in this second term. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=643.54s)]
*  And I wonder, given how central that has become to 2.0 Trump, how much that is according [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=650.9s)]
*  to plan or how much it has started to veer into something that is just a kind of a personal [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=658.9799999999999s)]
*  project of the president and not according to the original plan. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=665.3s)]
*  And again, I want to cite the polling that suggests that a majority of Americans are [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=668.9s)]
*  not comfortable with his pursuit of his enemies. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=675.2199999999999s)]
*  It's a little bit of both, Michael. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=679.5s)]
*  So there were a series of promises that Trump made on the campaign trail that dovetailed [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=681.06s)]
*  with where the Republican Party and conservatives are generally, which is, you know, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=686.0999999999999s)]
*  anti-DEI, anti-quote unquote woke and anti-elite universities. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=689.9s)]
*  So that is part of the plan. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=694.82s)]
*  The retribution on law firms, I think, has been a more recent development. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=697.1s)]
*  And that has just been something that has evolved pretty rapidly because they saw they [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=702.66s)]
*  had success. Then it moved into targeted, named individual presidential memos from the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=707.42s)]
*  Oval Office. One was Miles Taylor, who was a DHS official in Trump 1, and one was Chris [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=714.98s)]
*  Krebs, who was a cybersecurity official who said that the election voting machines had [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=720.3s)]
*  not been rigged, that it was a safe election. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=725.02s)]
*  Which is true. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=726.66s)]
*  That was it. Yes, that was it was true. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=727.38s)]
*  And that was his sin. His sin was stating the truth. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=728.74s)]
*  And Trump ordered up investigations by his administration into these two after, you know, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=731.38s)]
*  insisting repeatedly, always with a bit of a wink during the 2024 campaign that success [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=738.26s)]
*  would be his retribution after aides nudged him to stop talking about who he was going [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=743.54s)]
*  to get back at. And success has not been. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=747.22s)]
*  The success has not been his only retribution. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=748.98s)]
*  There's been retribution has been. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=751.18s)]
*  Actual retribution has been his retribution and is clearly a part that he is enjoying. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=752.2199999999999s)]
*  Charlie, would you describe this campaign of retribution, which, as Maggie just said, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=756.98s)]
*  ranges from institutional to personal as a success? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=762.9399999999999s)]
*  And I guess if it is, what's the criteria for describing it as a success or if it's a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=767.86s)]
*  failure, what's the criteria for describing it as a failure? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=773.18s)]
*  Because it has definitely become a pillar of the second term. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=776.3399999999999s)]
*  I guess I hesitate to pin the word success to something that dark. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=780.54s)]
*  He has indeed, you know, messed with the lives of the people that he has targeted. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=786.06s)]
*  Chris Krebs, who he ordered the Justice Department to try to pin a crime on, as you just [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=792.54s)]
*  mentioned, for the sin of accurately describing the state of election machines in 2020, had [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=798.54s)]
*  to quit his job because he had also targeted the company that Krebs worked for. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=804.74s)]
*  He had to quit his private sector job. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=810.54s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Wow. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=812.46s)]
*  And, you know, we should pause over that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=813.3s)]
*  You know, that is something he said he was going to do. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=815.54s)]
*  Our first major project of our series was about his claim that he would, you know, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=817.86s)]
*  appoint a real special counsel to go after the Biden family. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=822.54s)]
*  But the real thing he was doing there was saying he was going to take control of the [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=825.94s)]
*  believers of federal law enforcement power from the Oval Office and blow through the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=831.06s)]
*  post-Watergate norm that presidents don't politicize the enforcement of the law. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=836.02s)]
*  And he was going to proudly do so. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=841.06s)]
*  And he has now. He has done that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=842.26s)]
*  Jonathan, it's hard to dispute the idea that this campaign of retribution has [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=844.26s)]
*  successfully changed the culture of several major institutions. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=851.02s)]
*  I'm thinking about the state of pro-Palestinian anti-Israeli protests on college campuses, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=855.18s)]
*  which have very much been quieted. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=860.26s)]
*  I'm thinking about how much DEI is on the way out of major companies and universities. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=863.38s)]
*  And in a sense, values and practices and entire teams that had become deeply embedded [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=869.18s)]
*  at some of these institutions have now been forcibly excised at the insistence of one [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=875.7s)]
*  man, the president of the United States. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=882.26s)]
*  I have no qualms about describing it as a success. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=885.98s)]
*  I would say it's stunningly successful, perhaps the most successful element of his [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=888.3s)]
*  program so far. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=892.14s)]
*  You can affix monetary value to it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=893.54s)]
*  He has extorted about a billion dollars collectively in pro bono work from these law [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=896.38s)]
*  firms on behalf of his agenda. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=902.02s)]
*  They've said, Mr. Trump, please don't hurt us. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=903.9s)]
*  Please don't attack us. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=906.3s)]
*  We will do all this work for you for free. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=907.46s)]
*  A hundred million dollars worth of free work. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=909.42s)]
*  Utter capitulation. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=912.06s)]
*  The universities, as you say, are changing their policies. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=913.78s)]
*  And then just look at corporate America. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=916.3s)]
*  I mean, you had this procession of CEOs go down to Mar-a-Lago during the transition, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=918.0600000000001s)]
*  go sit down, have dinner with him, and then they gave him money. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=924.26s)]
*  They gave a million dollar check here for his inauguration. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=927.82s)]
*  And then his people, his political offer, he came back to them and said, actually, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=930.34s)]
*  guys, we need a little more money. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=933.22s)]
*  His political operation, Maggie will know the figure better than me. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=935.1800000000001s)]
*  It keeps growing. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=937.86s)]
*  But, you know, we're going to see probably a billion dollars plowed into this thing by [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=939.14s)]
*  the midterm elections. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=943.74s)]
*  By the end of this year, he is going to have raised almost a billion dollars. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=945.14s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=948.0999999999999s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=948.78s)]
*  And Jonathan, you used the word extortion. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=949.54s)]
*  I did. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=951.5s)]
*  And I don't think that was an accident. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=952.0999999999999s)]
*  What else would you use? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=952.8599999999999s)]
*  There's no other word for it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=954.78s)]
*  I don't even know if Trump would dispute that word. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=956.18s)]
*  I mean, he is like publicly boasting. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=958.7399999999999s)]
*  I think he'd be proud of it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=961.2199999999999s)]
*  He uses the phrase bend the knee about how people are engaging with him. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=962.38s)]
*  It's this, from Trump's perspective, this virtuous cycle. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=965.9799999999999s)]
*  Businesses are scared. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=972.3s)]
*  They give the money. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=973.3s)]
*  The money goes into Trump's political operation, which is designed to put the fear of God [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=974.62s)]
*  into any Republican who will step out of line, oppose his agenda. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=979.6999999999999s)]
*  So it's this circle, right? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=983.22s)]
*  Money comes in. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=984.9399999999999s)]
*  Money is used to intimidate. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=986.38s)]
*  Intimidation, you know, extracts more money. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=988.98s)]
*  And around the circle goes. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=993.14s)]
*  On that note, we're going to take a break. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=998.78s)]
*  And when we come back, we're going to talk about Trump's ventures overseas. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=999.9399999999999s)]
*  And by that, I mean tariffs and diplomacy. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1005.38s)]
*  So we'll be right back. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1007.66s)]
*  Welcome back, the three of you. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1025.9s)]
*  Let us turn to an area where there hasn't quite been the same virtuous cycle for Trump, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1027.46s)]
*  like the one you were just describing before the break, Jonathan. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1033.74s)]
*  And that, I think we can all agree, is trade. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1036.4199999999998s)]
*  So when it comes to the president's tariffs, to the untrained eye, this does not appear [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1039.58s)]
*  to have been the execution of a careful plan. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1046.62s)]
*  There have been reversals galore, exemptions galore. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1050.62s)]
*  My question to you three is, have you come to understand, based on your reporting, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1054.94s)]
*  if it is really ad hoc or if there has been a plan all along for this program? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1059.7s)]
*  No, it's really ad hoc and it's a total mess. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1065.18s)]
*  And they're now desperately trying to find off ramps and ways of getting [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1067.66s)]
*  out of this global trade war that Trump has started. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1071.9s)]
*  And as one person said to me recently, Republicans might be afraid of Donald Trump, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1075.8600000000001s)]
*  but the bond markets aren't afraid of Donald Trump and the economy's not afraid of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1082.22s)]
*  Donald Trump and the stock market's not afraid of Donald Trump. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1085.26s)]
*  And he did run into something that he couldn't intimidate, that he couldn't threaten, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1088.14s)]
*  and that created such a sense of panic on his senior team that they basically begged [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1095.3400000000001s)]
*  him to initiate that 90 day pause on his reciprocal tariffs. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1101.3400000000001s)]
*  Begged. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1105.38s)]
*  They absolutely made a very strong case. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1106.3400000000001s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besant, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the Vice President, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1108.34s)]
*  even nobody, with perhaps the exception of Peter Navarro, thinks that Trump's plan of [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1112.98s)]
*  initiating a global trade war was well thought through and that it would create the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1121.78s)]
*  stipulated goal of a golden age of reshored heavy industry American manufacturing. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1126.98s)]
*  Well, so I want to raise something to the three of you, because one of the great, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1133.58s)]
*  important lasting lessons of our conversations during the campaign was that the president [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1137.02s)]
*  was going to surround himself with yes people who were not going to challenge him or get [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1140.98s)]
*  in his way. What you're describing is a series of advisors trying to stop him and get in [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1144.58s)]
*  his way and say no mass. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1149.8999999999999s)]
*  And these are people who were ideologically aligned with him and primed to support this [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1152.46s)]
*  agenda. But they said it went too far. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1158.82s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1161.94s)]
*  It was never really a clear agenda. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1162.9799999999998s)]
*  Certainly, if you look at the remarks from Scott Besant and Howard Lutner in the lead [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1165.62s)]
*  up to Election Day, they suggested that this was more just going to be to get better [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1168.6999999999998s)]
*  deals. This obviously is not what they were talking about. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1172.58s)]
*  And now, as Jonathan said, there is no clear off ramp and there is no clear end in sight. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1175.82s)]
*  And that is entirely of one man's doing and that is the president. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1181.1399999999999s)]
*  Charlie, it has to be a failure if your goal was to put up high tariff walls around the [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1184.4599999999998s)]
*  world in order to bring back domestic manufacturing and you're literally tearing those walls [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1189.5s)]
*  down or puncturing holes and walking through them back and forth. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1193.82s)]
*  That cannot be anything other than a failure. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1196.78s)]
*  You know, Michael, the discussion around the tariffs, I think, has been a little confused [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1199.9s)]
*  because there were multiple layers of tariffs that Trump imposed. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1204.58s)]
*  Right. And the thing that he put a 90 day pause on was this extra tariffs that he calls [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1209.54s)]
*  reciprocal, which are not reciprocal, but that's the label he attached to them. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1215.9399999999998s)]
*  So we keep using it for a country by country basis that now aren't happening. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1219.3799999999999s)]
*  But there is still now a massive new import tax on almost everything coming into the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1224.9799999999998s)]
*  country. Ten percent that he did not unwind. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1231.2199999999998s)]
*  Right. And he's basically made trade with China impossible by an enormous import [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1234.58s)]
*  taxes. Right. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1242.26s)]
*  And so shelves are going to start to go bare in Walmarts and targets around the country [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1244.02s)]
*  pretty soon. And the global trade war sort of picking a fight with everyone simultaneously, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1249.06s)]
*  while it doesn't have this extra kicker for now, is nevertheless raging. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1255.3799999999999s)]
*  All that's true, but they have clearly signaled that they are on a direction of retreat. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1262.5s)]
*  Yes. He has blinked. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1268.34s)]
*  And the only challenge for them is how to spin capitulation in a way that's not capitulation. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1270.5s)]
*  They are desperate for an off ramp with China to the point where Trump is saying that he got a [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1276.02s)]
*  phone call from President Xi Jinping, which as far as we can tell is a phone call that doesn't [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1281.06s)]
*  exist and never happened. So they're desperate for off ramps. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1285.2199999999998s)]
*  And Charlie's right. Like that doesn't mean that the crisis is going to be unwound because, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1288.9799999999998s)]
*  you know, so much damage has been done. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1295.06s)]
*  So much uncertainty has been injected, but they're very clearly signaling that they realize [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1296.98s)]
*  this went too far and they're trying to figure out a way to get back to something [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1301.46s)]
*  closer to the status quo. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1305.94s)]
*  All these trade policies have had another effect I want to talk through with you all, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1308.5800000000002s)]
*  which is that they have really scrambled global alliances. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1313.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think that brings us to our final big subject here, which is Trump's foreign policy [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1319.38s)]
*  in these first 100 days. And that seems to be the story of impatience. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1323.78s)]
*  And I wonder what that tells us about what the original plan was and how much he's [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1332.18s)]
*  sticking to it on areas ranging from Ukraine, Russia to the Middle East. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1337.46s)]
*  I look at it a little differently, Michael. Yes, it's impatience that there's not a deal yet. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1342.5s)]
*  Trump is now saying that he was kidding when he said that he could solve Ukraine and Russia's [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1346.18s)]
*  war in 24 hours. I think Trump would very much like to have a peace deal that he can hold up [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1351.14s)]
*  and say that he put into place. I do think the administration is pretty close to walking away [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1356.18s)]
*  from all of this, but he offered something that just he clearly couldn't deliver on and is not [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1360.9s)]
*  going to anytime soon. If you talk to his aides, they will say that peace deals is going to be, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1366.66s)]
*  you know, the focus of the next 100 days, but it was certainly not much in the first. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1371.62s)]
*  So foreign policy has not been an overwhelming success so far. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1376.1s)]
*  Can we talk about Putin for a minute? Because that seems to be a case where the president [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1380.5s)]
*  may have misunderstood or miscalculated his leverage. And I'm thinking about a quote he [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1386.42s)]
*  just gave to our colleagues over at the Atlantic magazine. He said what he relishes so much about [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1393.3s)]
*  these first 100 days of Term 2 is that I run the country and I run the world. But when it comes to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1399.38s)]
*  someone like Vladimir Putin, he offered Putin almost everything Putin could have ever wanted [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1405.7s)]
*  in a peace deal with Ukraine. And Putin is still not giving Trump an inch, which has required Trump [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1411.22s)]
*  to then take to social media and say, Vladimir, stop brutally attacking civilians in Ukraine to [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1418.5s)]
*  no avail. And so is that just a case of the president not understanding the superpower [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1424.26s)]
*  dynamics? I think it's the president realizing that he is getting played by Putin as he sort [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1430.82s)]
*  of acknowledged in a post that he did over the weekend on Truth Social. Vladimir's stop was, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1437.3s)]
*  I think, his effort at looking like he is saying something publicly, but it didn't end up looking [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1442.1799999999998s)]
*  particularly strong since Vladimir did not stop. I think a couple of things have happened. One is [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1446.5s)]
*  Trump thought he had more leverage than he actually does over Putin and Xi Jinping. I know from [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1451.3799999999999s)]
*  talking to people who've talked to Trump about this, that particularly with Xi Jinping, Trump [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1456.58s)]
*  had this idea that China would basically fold and that him and Xi Jinping would then get in the room [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1461.3s)]
*  together. On the tariff front. Yeah, on the tariff front. And China has made clear that that's not [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1469.3s)]
*  going to happen. On Russia, when he came into office and in the transition, he had this notion [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1473.62s)]
*  that what he would say privately is that Putin is in real trouble, his economy is in real trouble, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1480.02s)]
*  with additional sanctions or other financial measures, we can bring him to the table. Again, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1486.34s)]
*  looks like a miscalculation. Putin has built an economy based on wartime. Russia is one of the [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1493.06s)]
*  most sanctioned countries on earth. And when you have leaders like Putin and Xi Jinping, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1500.82s)]
*  who are dictators, who are not as responsive to public opinion, or any of the institutional [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1506.6599999999999s)]
*  pressures that a president leading a liberal democracy would be, there's a lot of pain that [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1514.5s)]
*  they can endure and put their populations through, in order to achieve something that they portray as [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1519.54s)]
*  a great outcome. So I think in those two cases, it's a misunderstanding of leverage. More broadly, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1525.54s)]
*  I think it's fascinating what's happening with foreign policy right now, because really, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1532.1s)]
*  what's happening in Europe, in Asia as well, they are already operating on the basis that they can't [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1535.46s)]
*  rely on America, that this security construct that has existed since the end of World War II, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1542.1s)]
*  and that this world order that America built, and this rules-based order, that no longer exists. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1547.54s)]
*  And not my line, but somebody writing in the Financial Times said, he is so obsessed with [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1552.5s)]
*  the problem of free riders, that he forgets that it has been in America's interest to drive the bus. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1559.06s)]
*  So regardless of whether you think what Donald Trump is doing is smart, prudent, foolish, whatever, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1565.94s)]
*  there are going to be real costs to America not having that position of trust and centrality. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1574.42s)]
*  I mean, what you're clearly all getting at is that these first hundred days have been [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1580.42s)]
*  pretty monumental in ways that we're not going to fully understand for quite some time. It's [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1584.0200000000002s)]
*  going to take us years to understand all of the fallout and implications of it. And that makes me [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1588.74s)]
*  want to ask you all whether you think the first hundred days are prelude to what the next hundred [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1595.46s)]
*  days, and the next hundred days, and up to the next 1,300 days in the end of this term are going [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1601.38s)]
*  to look like. Or if you think there are some lessons this administration has learned that means [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1605.7800000000002s)]
*  they're going to start to change course in a meaningful way. I think you are seeing a pretty [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1610.0200000000002s)]
*  unbridled and confident Donald Trump, and I think that lacking any kind of a change in curtailing [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1615.6200000000001s)]
*  his power in any meaningful way, either by the courts or by Congress, you are going to continue [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1620.98s)]
*  to see more of that on a variety of fronts, not the least of which will be the retribution front. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1624.9s)]
*  I think until Congress changes hands, you're going to see what Maggie just laid out, with the one [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1631.3000000000002s)]
*  exception being they are absolutely second guessing their trade war and their tariff policy. But in [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1636.98s)]
*  every other aspect, it's not like there's somebody in there saying, Mr. President, you need to stop [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1643.5400000000002s)]
*  doing X, Y, and Z. That doesn't exist. And I thought it was a really good conversation actually [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1649.0600000000002s)]
*  between our colleagues, Ezra Klein and Ross Douthat. They got at something that Maggie and [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1653.7s)]
*  I talk about all the time, which is that for people who are working for him, particularly [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1657.7s)]
*  people who've been with him for the last four years, and they've watched this person be the [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1662.82s)]
*  pariah after January 6th, indicted in four different jurisdictions, criminally convicted, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1668.5800000000002s)]
*  literally shot like an inch from dying. And then he wins the presidency and comes back to the Oval [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1674.18s)]
*  Office. There is a mystical... Yeah, there's a kind of mystical quality was what our colleagues said. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1679.78s)]
*  Yeah, that is the word they use. And it's like, this guy must know something that we don't know. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1684.34s)]
*  And so it's a different element when you have things that in the first term, when Trump was [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1689.7s)]
*  like, let's tariff the world, Gary Cohn or Steve Minich would be like, no, that's insane. Let's [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1694.02s)]
*  not tariff the world. You don't have those conversations anymore. You have an argument [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1699.62s)]
*  within narrower margins. Should we give this exemption? Should we give that exemption? So [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1704.58s)]
*  there is a deference to his instincts that is genuine and powerful and not just a bunch of [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1710.18s)]
*  toady sycophants who are submerging their own views to serve orange guard. It's actually something [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1717.38s)]
*  much deeper than that. I would add one piece to that too, Michael, which is just that as [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1726.1s)]
*  Jonathan said, they have all been through these various travails with him and they feel incredibly [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1730.82s)]
*  bonded to him in a way that the folks in the first term for the most part just did not. And so it is [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1736.02s)]
*  not only that he must be seeing things on a level that they are not and hearing frequencies that [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1742.8999999999999s)]
*  they're not. It's that things are destined to work out for him and they have seen so many people come [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1747.3799999999999s)]
*  at him who they think were acting inappropriately. Add to the mix. I mean, the courts have been [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1753.06s)]
*  sort of alone out there and offering some resistance with Congress completely supine. And [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1759.78s)]
*  even if Democrats do get the House, he'll just ignore their subpoenas and Republicans will [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1766.74s)]
*  bail him out of impeachment again like last time. So the courts is where to look for is this guy [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1771.9399999999998s)]
*  unstoppable regardless of the chaos surrounding him. And for all the talk of defying court orders [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1778.8999999999999s)]
*  and stuff, we are speaking a hundred days in. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the merits [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1785.62s)]
*  on any of the stuff he's doing and a whole cascade is coming their way. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1792.1799999999998s)]
*  And they're seeing what it means to have an empowered president who doesn't have guardrails, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1804.26s)]
*  who doesn't have traditional constraints. And so there are some big decisions they have to make [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1810.58s)]
*  that have not yet been made that will tell us a lot. We have to wait and see what to make of all [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1816.8999999999999s)]
*  this in terms of how they rule. Right. And that of course is for the next hundred day episode. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1823.1399999999999s)]
*  So Charlie and Jonathan and Maggie, as ever, thank you very much. Thank you, Michael. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1829.62s)]
*  Thanks so much. Thank you. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1836.58s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1844.1s)]
*  Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, President Trump once again walked back [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1852.1s)]
*  some of his tariffs, this time on carmakers. The change would remove some tariffs that companies [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1858.74s)]
*  like Ford and General Motors complained amounted to them being tariffed twice in a way that hurt [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1865.38s)]
*  domestic manufacturing. Trump's original tariffs forced some carmakers to pay 25% fees on imported [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1872.5s)]
*  cars and to pay additional tariffs on materials like aluminum and steel. A new executive order [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1881.14s)]
*  would offer temporary relief from the tariffs on those materials. And in a sign of just how nervous [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1889.38s)]
*  the White House remains about the cost of its tariffs on consumers, President Trump called [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1897.38s)]
*  the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, and asked him not to display the impact of tariffs on Amazon's [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1902.9s)]
*  websites. Amazon had considered posting that information on one of its sites, but the White [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1910.58s)]
*  House quickly denounced the idea as a, quote, hostile and political act. Amazon now says that [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1917.62s)]
*  the idea was never formally approved and will not happen. Today's episode was produced by Rob Zipko, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1925.9399999999998s)]
*  Astha Chaturvedi, Carlos Prieto, and Mary Wilson. It was edited by Rachel Cuesta, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1937.1399999999999s)]
*  Paige Cowan, and Lexi D'Al. It contains original music by Mary Lazano, Dan Powell, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1943.7s)]
*  and Pat McCusker. And was engineered by Alyssa Moxley. Our theme music is by Jim [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1950.26s)]
*  Brunberg and Ben Landsberg of Wonderly. That's it for the Daily. I'm Michael Bobarro. See you tomorrow. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGWVO80ilqc&t=1956.18s)]
