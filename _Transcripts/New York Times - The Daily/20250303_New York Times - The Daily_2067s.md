# The Fallout From Zelensky and Trump’s Oval Office Meltdown
**New York Times - The Daily:** [March 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Michael Bobarro. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=0.0s)]
*  This is The Daily. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=4.42s)]
*  Today, the fallout from the extraordinary, televised, Oval Office shouting match between [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=8.86s)]
*  Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=20.02s)]
*  My colleague, Chief White House Correspondent Peter Baker, walks us through the clash and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=25.58s)]
*  its consequences. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=31.939999999999998s)]
*  It's Monday, March 3rd. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=47.62s)]
*  Peter, thank you for making time for us on a Sunday afternoon, no less. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=56.339999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=59.739999999999995s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=60.739999999999995s)]
*  I'm curious, Peter, where in the pantheon of moments that you have witnessed at the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=62.94s)]
*  White House over the past 30 years to date you, does what happened in the Oval Office [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=67.1s)]
*  on Friday fit, would you say? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=73.14s)]
*  Yeah, Michael, I've been covering these meetings at White Houses since 1996, and I've never [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=76.3s)]
*  seen anything like this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=81.7s)]
*  Never. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=83.38s)]
*  I've had the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, show up for a meeting with the President [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=84.38s)]
*  of the United States, Donald Trump, in the middle of a war with so much at stake. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=89.02s)]
*  And so, you know, everybody was looking to this meeting to see how it would come together. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was extraordinary. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=97.58s)]
*  It was excruciating. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=99.58s)]
*  It was a brutal dressing down of a foreign leader in the Oval Office. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=100.58s)]
*  Presidents just don't do that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=105.62s)]
*  They get frustrated at times, and sometimes they're appointed moments, but nothing like [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=106.62s)]
*  this verbal assault that we've seen even on an adversary, much less on an ally. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=112.58s)]
*  And I think in history, we're going to look back on this as a unique singular moment. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=119.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=124.25999999999999s)]
*  And not just for the spectacle of it, but for its actual consequentialness. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=130.34s)]
*  This is a rupture of a relationship now between the United States and Ukraine, 11 years after [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=131.98s)]
*  Russia first invaded, three years after its full-fledged invasion in 2022. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=137.38s)]
*  And America has been Ukraine's best friend, biggest partner, most important patron. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=141.82s)]
*  And if this rupture, this blow up, this meltdown in the Oval Office means that the relationship [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=146.46s)]
*  now is on the rocks, it has great consequences for Ukraine, especially. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=151.38s)]
*  It has great consequences for Russian aggression in the world, for Europe, and for the United [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=155.66s)]
*  States, I would say. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=161.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=162.74s)]
*  And for all those reasons, I suspect, history will keep turning over this encounter for [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=163.74s)]
*  a very long time, as will we in this conversation in a few moments. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=169.9s)]
*  But I think it's worth setting up a bit what led to this blow up and talk through the kind [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=174.5s)]
*  of dynamics into which both men entered the Oval Office on Friday. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=188.18s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's important to know the history. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=189.18s)]
*  President Trump has never liked Ukraine in particular. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=191.66s)]
*  He was convinced way back in his first term that Ukraine had been opposed his election [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=194.68s)]
*  in 2016. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=200.14s)]
*  This is a Russian talking point. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=201.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=202.14s)]
*  This is a Russian intelligence fable, but one that Trump bought into. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=203.14s)]
*  And of course, Zelensky was the other guy on the phone. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=206.66s)]
*  He had the quote, perfect phone call, not so perfect, that led to his impeachment, in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=209.5s)]
*  which he tried to bully Zelensky into launching a fake investigation of Joe Biden. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=213.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=219.22s)]
*  Has Trump ever had such awkward history, perhaps, as world leaders? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=220.3s)]
*  Very awkward history. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=224.3s)]
*  And during the last four years, when Trump was out of office, he was never supportive [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=225.3s)]
*  of Ukraine in its war against Russia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=229.3s)]
*  He praised Vladimir Putin for being a genius for sending troops to pressure Ukraine into [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=231.22s)]
*  making concessions. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=236.34s)]
*  And he opposed aid to Ukraine, basically blocked it by Republicans in the House, forced them [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=237.7s)]
*  to block it for about six months. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=243.66s)]
*  And sitting next to him was JD Vance, who was famously quoted saying, I don't care what [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=245.66s)]
*  happens in Ukraine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=249.94s)]
*  So these are not supporters of Ukraine going into this meeting. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=251.38s)]
*  And then over the last two weeks, you see the relationship really change dramatically. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=254.66s)]
*  Instead of Joe Biden sending arms and standing with Ukraine saying, we will never, never, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=259.54s)]
*  never not be with you, you have Donald Trump coming in and calling Zelensky a dictator, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=265.42s)]
*  saying it was Ukraine falsely that started the war, adopting Russian talking points about [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=271.98s)]
*  whether Zelensky should have to have elections, never mind that Vladimir Putin is the dictator, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  that he started the war and that he has fake elections at home. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=281.82s)]
*  He was basically 180 degrees changing American policy towards Russia and Ukraine, making [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=285.28s)]
*  clear that in this new Cold War that we've been talking about now for so long, America [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=290.94s)]
*  was essentially switching sides. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=295.21999999999997s)]
*  And for Zelensky, this is existential for him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=297.9s)]
*  And he faced this pressure from Trump to sign a rare minerals deal, handing over a lot of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=300.9s)]
*  Ukraine's natural resources to the United States without any assurance that the United [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=306.78000000000003s)]
*  States is going to give them anything back. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=311.74s)]
*  Trump said you owe us back basically for all the aid that Biden gave you over the last [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=313.26s)]
*  three years. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=317.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=318.5s)]
*  So Zelensky unhappily, grudgingly comes to Washington as almost a supplicant to sign [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=319.5s)]
*  this agreement, hoping that that will keep Trump on Ukraine's side in any future peace [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=325.26s)]
*  talks. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=329.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=330.54s)]
*  Zelensky, as you've clearly just laid out here, has no affection for Trump, but will [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=331.54s)]
*  agree to come to Washington to sign this minerals deal, mostly to protect whatever existing [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=337.82s)]
*  frayed attenuated relationship the U.S. still has with Ukraine as a supporter of its defense. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=345.18s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=351.58000000000004s)]
*  Because he hopes that it will keep the United States on Ukraine's side, give it something [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  at stake in the war, in this case, economic stakes. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=358.74s)]
*  And he knows how much that matters to Trump. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=362.38s)]
*  So Zelensky shows up at the White House on Friday morning and Trump comes out at the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=364.74s)]
*  door to greet him as he does with foreign leaders. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  And they have a polite handshake, but not a lot of warmth, I would say. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=372.06s)]
*  And Trump makes a comment as Zelensky arrives that later, I think, becomes kind of telling. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=376.86s)]
*  He says, I see you came dressed up for the occasion. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=381.66s)]
*  Zelensky, of course, is wearing his tactical, dark sweater, one of the versions of the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=384.98s)]
*  combat type clothing he's been wearing for the last three years in solidarity with Ukrainian [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=391.7s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=395.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=396.98s)]
*  And they go into the Oval Office, they take their seats. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=397.98s)]
*  There's a number of top officials there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=402.14s)]
*  J.D. Vance is there. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=403.94s)]
*  Secretary Rubio is there. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=405.26s)]
*  And the meeting gets off to a relatively fine start. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=407.38s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=410.14s)]
*  It's an honor to have President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=411.94s)]
*  And we've been working very hard, very close. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=416.26s)]
*  So we've actually known each other for a long time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=418.58s)]
*  We've been dealing with each other for a long time and very well. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=420.74s)]
*  But Zelensky is trying to make sure Trump understands that Ukraine is the victim, not [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=424.02s)]
*  the villain in this war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=429.82s)]
*  I wanted to share with you some images. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=431.1s)]
*  How it's just, just can I know? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=434.54s)]
*  He shows in pictures of Ukrainian men and women who have been released from Russian [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=440.26s)]
*  prisons and how emaciated they are, how terribly abused they had been in Russian captivity. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=445.14s)]
*  He tries to get Trump to see that the Russians are the bad guys here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=451.22s)]
*  I mean, it's looking tragic. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=456.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough stuff. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=459.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=461.94s)]
*  And the first 20 minutes, 25 minutes are perfectly normal, perfectly fine. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=462.94s)]
*  But you begin to hear a little bit of an edge. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=468.7s)]
*  You begin to hear a little bit of the tension that's there. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=470.82s)]
*  Does that still provide security guarantees, Mr. President? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=472.97999999999996s)]
*  I don't want to talk about security yet because I want to get the deal done. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=476.38s)]
*  You know, you fall into the same trap like everybody else a million times. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=479.53999999999996s)]
*  You said over and over, I want to get the deal done. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=482.98s)]
*  Security is so easy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=486.14s)]
*  That's about 2% of the problem. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=487.14s)]
*  I'm not worried about security. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=489.5s)]
*  I'm worried about getting the deal done. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=491.18s)]
*  And they just don't see the war in the same way. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=493.14s)]
*  Before my presidency, from 2014, Putin broken 25 times. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=496.42s)]
*  25 times he broken his own signature. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=501.98s)]
*  25 times he broken ceasefire. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=507.38s)]
*  But he never broke to me. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=509.42s)]
*  He never broke to me. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=510.90000000000003s)]
*  No, no, you were the president. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=511.90000000000003s)]
*  You were the president. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=512.9s)]
*  He never broke to me. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=513.9s)]
*  In 2016, you were the president, Mr. President. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=514.9s)]
*  You've been the president. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=517.9s)]
*  Zelensky does not want Trump to negotiate a ceasefire with Russia with no conditions. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=519.62s)]
*  And Ukraine gets nothing out of it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=526.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=527.82s)]
*  Doesn't think Putin can be trusted. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=528.82s)]
*  That's why we will never accept just ceasefire. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=530.34s)]
*  It will not work without security guarantees. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=534.26s)]
*  He doesn't think that a ceasefire would hold. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=536.3000000000001s)]
*  So he says, I need security guarantees. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=538.82s)]
*  And that's what he's there to ask the United States for. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=541.86s)]
*  And Trump does not want to have anything to do with it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=544.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't think you're going to need much security. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=545.78s)]
*  I think once this deal gets done, it's over. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=547.38s)]
*  Russia is not going to want to go back and nobody's going to want to go back. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=550.1800000000001s)]
*  When this deal ends, I really believe this deal is going to be over. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=554.3s)]
*  But then in the midst of this back and forth, suddenly you hear a new voice. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=558.62s)]
*  I will respond to this. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=562.78s)]
*  So look. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=564.2199999999999s)]
*  It's the vice president, JD Vance, who hasn't really been talking in the meeting and then [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=565.2199999999999s)]
*  it pipes up and he says, I want to interject here. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=568.1s)]
*  And he offers a pointed defense of Trump's approach to the conflict. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=570.74s)]
*  Trump is the one, he says, who's going to bring peace. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=575.02s)]
*  He's going to be engaging in diplomacy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=577.26s)]
*  That's what President Trump is doing. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=580.22s)]
*  Can I ask you? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=581.74s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=583.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=584.38s)]
*  OK. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=585.38s)]
*  And Zelensky, who's been listening to all this, really feels like he has to respond [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=586.38s)]
*  here. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=590.98s)]
*  During 2014 till 2022, the situation was the same. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=591.98s)]
*  People have been dying on the contact line. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=598.1s)]
*  Nobody stopped him. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=601.22s)]
*  And Zelensky basically proceeds to pick apart this idea that diplomacy is necessarily going [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=602.26s)]
*  to work. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=607.26s)]
*  He points out there's a long history here. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=608.26s)]
*  The war didn't just start three years ago. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=610.02s)]
*  Started in 2014 when Putin first sent forces into Ukraine, seized Crimea, began seizing [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=612.06s)]
*  parts of eastern Ukraine. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=617.86s)]
*  And he points out that this war had been going on ever since, including during Trump's presidency. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=619.54s)]
*  But after that, he broken this ceasefire. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=625.62s)]
*  He killed our people and he didn't exchange prisoners. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=628.8199999999999s)]
*  We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=632.56s)]
*  And that seems to get under Trump and Vance's skin. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=635.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=640.1s)]
*  It feels worth noting that in this moment, Zelensky decides to call the vice president [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=641.1s)]
*  JD, not Vice President Vance. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=646.54s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy JD you are speaking about? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=649.54s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=653.02s)]
*  Perhaps history will not note this as an important moment. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=654.98s)]
*  I noted it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=657.18s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=658.18s)]
*  And look, you know, on one level, you can say he's trying to be friendly with him. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=659.18s)]
*  Sometimes foreign leaders do refer to each other by their first names. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  But Vance takes offense and then jumps back in. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=666.82s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=670.0600000000001s)]
*  into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=673.74s)]
*  And this is when things go from bad to very bad. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=676.94s)]
*  You should be thanking the president for bringing it into this conflict. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=679.5400000000001s)]
*  You start hearing Vance say you should be grateful to us and really putting Zelensky [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  on the defensive there. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=687.62s)]
*  And Zelensky, of course, has thanked America for three years quite prolifically. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=688.94s)]
*  What's actually, I think, striking about that demand by Vance, you should be thanking us, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=694.4200000000001s)]
*  he is demanding that somebody thank two leaders who haven't supported Ukraine. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=700.22s)]
*  Trump and Vance don't support Ukraine, and yet he is saying you have to thank us. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=705.96s)]
*  And as Vance and Zelensky are really kind of going at it. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=711.1800000000001s)]
*  Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=714.5s)]
*  Vance is pushing Zelensky on problems the Ukrainian military is having with manpower [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=719.22s)]
*  and so forth. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=724.7s)]
*  And Zelensky is, yeah, of course, we have problems. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=725.7s)]
*  You'll have problems too, though. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=728.1s)]
*  Even you, but you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=730.08s)]
*  Just translate what he's saying there, because it feels like a really important point Zelensky [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=736.78s)]
*  is trying to make. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=739.58s)]
*  His point is that Russia poses a threat to the United States, not just Ukraine. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=740.58s)]
*  A lot of times Trump talks about this. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=744.86s)]
*  He says, this is really a problem for Europe. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=746.34s)]
*  It's not for us. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=748.1800000000001s)]
*  In fact, Trump has said we have this big ocean between us. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=750.14s)]
*  So what do we care what happens in Ukraine? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=751.9799999999999s)]
*  And Zelensky is pushing back on that idea. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=754.14s)]
*  Listen, yes, you have this nice ocean and you don't feel it now. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=755.78s)]
*  A lot of distance between you and Russia. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=758.38s)]
*  That doesn't mean that Russia isn't also a threat to the United States. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=760.0999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean the United States doesn't have a stake in this, has an interest in who [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=762.78s)]
*  wins this war and whether Russia comes out of it feeling rewarded for its aggression. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=767.3399999999999s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=772.6999999999999s)]
*  We're trying to solve a problem. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=774.38s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=776.0s)]
*  This is the moment that Trump now jumps in. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=778.3s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=780.5799999999999s)]
*  We're going to feel very good. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=785.54s)]
*  And he begins to really kind of berate Zelensky in this very aggressive way. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  You're not in a good position. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=792.6999999999999s)]
*  You don't have the cards right now. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=795.14s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  Right now you're playing cards. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=799.6999999999999s)]
*  You're playing cards. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=801.9799999999999s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=803.2199999999999s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=806.34s)]
*  You're gambling with World War III. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=808.78s)]
*  In effect, what Trump is saying is, Zelensky, all you need to understand is that you have [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=812.02s)]
*  no power right now. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=817.46s)]
*  We have all the power. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=818.78s)]
*  Get on board or you're in real trouble. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=820.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=822.6600000000001s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=823.6600000000001s)]
*  You're running low on soldiers. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=824.6600000000001s)]
*  Listen. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=825.6600000000001s)]
*  Don't play this space of breath. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=826.6600000000001s)]
*  You're running low on soldiers. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=827.6600000000001s)]
*  It would be a damn good thing. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=828.6600000000001s)]
*  Then you tell us, I don't want to cease fire. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=829.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't want to cease fire. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=834.26s)]
*  What he's saying is, you have to accept whatever deal I make with Putin. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=835.3s)]
*  You don't have any power. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=839.66s)]
*  You're not able to influence things. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=840.88s)]
*  And that's a really extraordinary thing to say to the leader of a country at war. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=842.66s)]
*  He's saying, you don't get to choose here. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=847.66s)]
*  I'm the one who's going to choose here. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=849.9s)]
*  Because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=852.46s)]
*  With us, you have the cards. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=854.78s)]
*  But without us, you don't have any cards. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=856.74s)]
*  What an extraordinary moment, right? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=860.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=862.06s)]
*  We should say, at this moment, all three of these leaders, seasoned leaders, could have [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=863.8599999999999s)]
*  chosen to de-escalate what's becoming an incredibly acrimonious, almost shouting match. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=876.42s)]
*  But they don't. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=883.26s)]
*  They all seem quite loaded for bear. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=884.4s)]
*  They do. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=886.5999999999999s)]
*  This is where clearly a lot of weeks, if not months, of tension have come to the surface. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=887.5999999999999s)]
*  And they're just exploding in this meeting. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=891.74s)]
*  And they're saying what they have been thinking or feeling for quite a while. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=895.54s)]
*  And it just escalates rather than de-escalates. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=899.02s)]
*  And you finally get to the point where Trump is relitigating the whole Russia investigation. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=901.66s)]
*  Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=906.9s)]
*  He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=909.1s)]
*  You ever hear of that deal? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=914.82s)]
*  That was a phony, that was a phony, Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=915.82s)]
*  Hillary Clinton. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=920.7s)]
*  And he says, Vladimir Putin and I went through this whole Russia hoax. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=921.7s)]
*  He went through it. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=925.5400000000001s)]
*  He was accused of all that stuff. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=926.5400000000001s)]
*  He had nothing to do with it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=927.86s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=928.86s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=932.38s)]
*  It was disgusting. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=935.44s)]
*  What an amazing thing to say, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=937.5s)]
*  The person he clearly feels a bond with is Putin, not with Volodymyr Zelensky, who runs [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=940.1800000000001s)]
*  country that has been allied with the United States and is under fire. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=948.3s)]
*  The problem is, I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=952.3s)]
*  Finally Trump lays down his cards and he says, but you're either going to make a deal or [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=956.78s)]
*  we're out. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=961.4s)]
*  And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=962.4s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=965.2199999999999s)]
*  Basically either you're with us, either you go along with what I'm going to do or we're [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=969.4599999999999s)]
*  out. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=975.12s)]
*  We'll abandon you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=976.12s)]
*  It's a very stark threat. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=978.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=980.16s)]
*  I think we've seen enough. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=981.16s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=982.16s)]
*  This is going to be great television. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=983.16s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=986.48s)]
*  And then the reporters are escorted out of the room. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=990.88s)]
*  Peter, once the shock wore off for me, at least, and as I told you, I'm watching this [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=994.36s)]
*  as well. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=999.32s)]
*  I had this sense, and I wonder if you did as well, that people in the two delegations, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1000.92s)]
*  the Zelensky camp and the Trump camp, they're going to find a way to try to smooth this [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1005.8s)]
*  over after the cameras leave the room, because of course they are there to sign a deal. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1010.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1016.24s)]
*  This deal is supposed to be signed. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1017.24s)]
*  They're supposed to use this deal to put the relationship on a new foundation going forward. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1018.76s)]
*  And now with the cameras out of the room, are they going to make apologies or at least [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  smooth it over? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1028.32s)]
*  And will they still have the lunch? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1029.32s)]
*  Will they still sign the deal that was the whole point of him coming in the first place? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1031.24s)]
*  Will they have the news conference been set up in the East Room waiting for us any minute [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1034.72s)]
*  now? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1038.6000000000001s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1039.6000000000001s)]
*  But then suddenly we get the answer. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1042.1200000000001s)]
*  Zelensky's car has just pulled up to the door of the West Wing and he's leaving. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1044.48s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  Peter, pick the story up where you just left it off. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1064.64s)]
*  What ends up happening behind the scenes based on your reporting that ultimately ends with [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1074.0400000000002s)]
*  this day becoming totally unsalvageable? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1078.96s)]
*  Well, what we end up learning later is the two teams, the US team and the Ukrainian team, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1082.4s)]
*  head into separate rooms in the West Wing to collect themselves after this bruising [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1087.92s)]
*  battle in the Oval Office. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  And Zelensky still wants to salvage this thing. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1094.9199999999998s)]
*  He still wants to sign the deal. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1097.12s)]
*  He still wants to see if he can't smooth it over. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1098.6399999999999s)]
*  But the US side, Trump and his team are meeting in another part of the White House and they [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1103.0s)]
*  are furious. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1108.12s)]
*  And the answer to them is no, it's over. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  Tell them to leave. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  And two US officials then go to the room where Zelensky and his team are and explain to him, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1114.04s)]
*  you're out of here. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1119.8s)]
*  They're kicking Zelensky out of the White House. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1120.84s)]
*  Exactly right. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1122.52s)]
*  And so the reporters were all rushing out to the driveway and there's this black Chevy [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1123.52s)]
*  SUV, the suburban, at the door of the West Wing and out comes Volodymyr Zelensky looking [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1128.52s)]
*  very grim faced as he climbs in. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  And then the suburban pulls out of the White House driveway and off the White House grounds [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1137.3999999999999s)]
*  and you realize just how much has changed in those few minutes. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1142.44s)]
*  So lunch is off. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1147.8s)]
*  The press conference is off. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1148.8s)]
*  Trump's aides are busy eating the lunch that had actually been prepared for Zelensky, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1150.32s)]
*  this roasted chicken and creme brulee. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1153.8s)]
*  And Trump issues a statement on his social media platform and it says, I have determined [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  that President Zelensky is not ready for peace if America is involved. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1162.04s)]
*  He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1165.32s)]
*  He can come back when he is ready for peace. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1170.5s)]
*  Peter, the reactions to this encounter are all over the place, as you might expect. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1172.9199999999998s)]
*  You've got Republicans, some of them now saying it's time for Zelensky to resign and they [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1178.88s)]
*  are repeating the charge from Trump and Vance that Zelensky wasn't sufficiently respectful [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1183.3400000000001s)]
*  and that Ukraine should send the United States a leader who can show the president of the [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1188.44s)]
*  United States more respect. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1193.16s)]
*  Then you've got congressional Democrats who are aghast that the president would berate [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1194.66s)]
*  the leader of a country that is an American ally and furious that we seem to be giving [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1199.44s)]
*  a boost to Russia by humiliating the leader of Ukraine. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1204.9s)]
*  And so I'm curious what you're making of those two drastically different responses to this [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1210.8200000000002s)]
*  same encounter. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1215.7800000000002s)]
*  Senator Graham. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1216.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I was there on the White House driveway when Senator Lindsey Graham came out. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1217.7800000000002s)]
*  What do I think? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1223.0600000000002s)]
*  Complete utter disaster. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1225.18s)]
*  Essentially sent out by the White House to say not only that it was Zelensky's fault. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1227.5400000000002s)]
*  I talked to Zelensky this morning. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1232.02s)]
*  Don't take the bait. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1234.6999999999998s)]
*  President Trump was in a very good mood last night. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1236.54s)]
*  Somebody asked me, am I embarrassed about Trump? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1239.3799999999999s)]
*  I have never been more proud of the president. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1242.54s)]
*  And that he's proud of Trump for standing up for America, but that if Zelensky wouldn't [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1244.9399999999998s)]
*  change it, he should even resign. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1248.9799999999998s)]
*  What I saw in the Oval Office was disrespectful. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1251.7199999999998s)]
*  And I don't know if we can ever do business with Zelensky again. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1255.1399999999999s)]
*  And what a remarkable 180 degrees for the Graham wing of the Republican Party, what [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1260.9s)]
*  used to be the Reagan wing of the Republican Party. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1266.22s)]
*  Graham was one of the most hawkish pro-Ukraine, anti-Russia voices on the scene. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1268.8600000000001s)]
*  And now he has fallen in line behind Trump. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1274.5400000000002s)]
*  But the Democrats, the only person who had been disrespected in that meeting was Zelensky. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1278.18s)]
*  So all Zelensky asked yesterday was, how do you know that diplomacy will work? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1283.7s)]
*  And because he had the audacity to ask that simple question, he was ushered out of the [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1289.52s)]
*  White House. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1296.16s)]
*  And apparently the United States is going to do Putin's bidding and hand him. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1297.82s)]
*  The Democrats are the ones who are left to defend Ukraine and call for a more skeptical [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1302.8s)]
*  view of Russia and to cast Russia as the enemy. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1310.16s)]
*  Zelensky is leading a country trying to defend democracy against an authoritarian dictator, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1314.72s)]
*  Putin, who invaded his country. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1322.14s)]
*  And our job is to defend the 250-year tradition that we have of being the democratic leader [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1324.92s)]
*  of the world, not turn our backs on a struggling country that is trying to do the right thing. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1332.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1339.0s)]
*  So that's the domestic political response, Peter. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1340.0s)]
*  But the responses that most intrigued me were from people who said basically, wasn't this [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1343.34s)]
*  a moment of unvarnished truth telling from President Trump? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1351.3799999999999s)]
*  Ukraine does not have a good hand. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1357.62s)]
*  It is deeply reliant on American military aid. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1360.1399999999999s)]
*  It's struggling to recruit soldiers. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1363.1s)]
*  It cannot win a war of attrition against Russia. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1365.8999999999999s)]
*  And it's not really a priority for the Trump administration. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1369.22s)]
*  So in a way, Trump was being very clear and very direct about all of that in this confrontation. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1373.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, it is certainly the case that a lot of people believe the United States [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1382.1000000000001s)]
*  needs to focus its priorities either at home or perhaps against China, because that's the [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1387.18s)]
*  bigger threat. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1393.54s)]
*  And therefore, we have to recalibrate our relationship with Europe, our commitments [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1394.54s)]
*  in Europe, our hostility toward Russia. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1399.54s)]
*  And the strategic thought that you hear from some people behind what happened on Friday [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1403.26s)]
*  is it's time for us to cut bait and be friendlier with Russia because we need them against China. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1407.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't know how much that's part of Trump's own thinking, but certainly some people around [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1413.74s)]
*  him give voice to that analysis. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1417.26s)]
*  And so, of course, to see the very personal and visceral way that Trump was willing to [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1420.9s)]
*  cut loose an ally in furtherance of this strategy was pretty striking, even if that's what you [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1427.38s)]
*  wanted to do. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1433.7800000000002s)]
*  Doing it in this way, I think, was pretty shocking for a lot of people. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1434.7800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1438.5800000000002s)]
*  Which is a slightly different question and one that is important, which is, was this [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1439.5800000000002s)]
*  done poorly and politely? [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1443.48s)]
*  Shockingly so to some. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1446.02s)]
*  But I think it feels like Trump's goal here is to focus, like you just said, on Russia [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1448.38s)]
*  and China and that in the end, Ukraine stands in the way of that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1456.5s)]
*  Trump wants to be sitting down across from Putin or Xi Jinping. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1462.1000000000001s)]
*  He does not want to have to be worrying about a war in Ukraine. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1465.42s)]
*  No question that Trump respects strength and power and he sees the world as a place where [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1470.66s)]
*  big men and big powers like the United States and Putin's Russia divide up their spheres [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  of influence very much like a 19th century or mid-20th century view of things, while [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1481.6599999999999s)]
*  the democracies will simply have to eat it if they have to. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1487.78s)]
*  What matters more is who is powerful, not who has the same kind of governmental system. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1491.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1496.3s)]
*  And that leaves the question then, does Ukraine become, in effect, roadkill on the way to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1497.3s)]
*  this real politic goal and what happens to the US relationship with other democracies [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1502.06s)]
*  in Asia and Europe? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1507.3799999999999s)]
*  And do we embolden authoritarian governments like Putin by rewarding them for their aggression? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1509.34s)]
*  Well, a related question to this, Peter, is Europe going to pick up the slack if the US, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1516.1399999999999s)]
*  if Trump is going to walk away from this to focus on Russia and China and, to use your [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1523.02s)]
*  words, potentially leave Ukraine as roadkill in the pursuit of that goal, is Europe going [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1529.06s)]
*  to step in and protect Ukraine? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1535.18s)]
*  And it was striking how much in the hours after Zelensky was kicked out of the White [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1537.98s)]
*  House, European leaders lionized him and posed the question of what their role needed to [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1541.1s)]
*  be if the US walks away. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1547.66s)]
*  I mean, the prime minister of France wrote, by refusing to bend in Washington, Volodymyr [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1550.1399999999999s)]
*  Zelensky, was the honor of Europe. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1554.98s)]
*  But then goes on to write, now it is upon us Europeans to decide what we want to be [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1557.5s)]
*  and whether we want to be. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1564.46s)]
*  And I took that to mean her saying, Europe, are we going to step up and solve the problems [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1567.46s)]
*  for Ukraine that the US has until now, but seems to be walking away from? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1573.88s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1578.9s)]
*  So as soon as Zelensky leaves Washington, he heads to London, where he meets with European [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1579.9s)]
*  leaders, including Keir Starmer, the British prime minister. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1584.66s)]
*  And this was already planned before the blow up in the Oval Office. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1587.5400000000002s)]
*  But it's such a remarkable amount of timing because he is greeted with open arms, right? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1591.8400000000001s)]
*  The Europeans have rallied to his side in this one after the other across the continent. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1597.7s)]
*  They said, we stand with Ukraine, we stand with Zelensky. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1603.2s)]
*  They say the things that you just quoted the French prime minister is saying. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1606.18s)]
*  Starmer promises more funding, a couple more billion dollars worth of weapons for advanced [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1610.66s)]
*  air defense missiles, and talks about a peacekeeping force that the Europeans can put together [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1616.5s)]
*  even without the Americans once there is a peace deal, if there's a peace deal to try [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1622.46s)]
*  to enforce it. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1626.66s)]
*  But it's a test. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1628.6200000000001s)]
*  It's a real test because time and time again, Europeans have said, yeah, we're going to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1629.78s)]
*  step up and take more of the burden from the United States without actually following through. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1633.38s)]
*  They have risen to the occasion with Ukraine over these last three years. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1639.58s)]
*  They've actually donated more money for Ukraine's defense than the United States has. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1642.46s)]
*  You may have heard Trump say the opposite. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1646.3s)]
*  He's wrong about that. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1647.82s)]
*  But it's still a question whether they can do everything that Ukraine would need and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1649.86s)]
*  would lose without American support. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1654.58s)]
*  And for Europe, it really is a moment of truth. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1657.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1660.46s)]
*  And it seems worth noting that UK's prime minister, even as he announced more money [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1661.46s)]
*  for Ukraine, said, we've got to be honest, we still need a backstop from the US. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1665.5s)]
*  There's nothing approaching a true guarantee of Ukraine's safety unless the US is involved. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1672.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1679.22s)]
*  I mean, you know, they don't expect the US to put troops on the ground. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1680.22s)]
*  What they would like would be air support or logistical support or intel support and [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1682.58s)]
*  mainly just political and geopolitical support. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1687.06s)]
*  The idea that the United States is behind them on this and that Russia ought not to [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1690.48s)]
*  try anything because it would not just be aggravating Europe, but aggravating the United [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1694.5s)]
*  States and taking a real chance there. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1698.14s)]
*  And it's not clear that Trump wants to do that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1699.8600000000001s)]
*  He said, I don't really care too much about what the security situation is after I make [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1701.64s)]
*  peace. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1705.58s)]
*  He trusts Vladimir Putin to keep the deal. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1706.58s)]
*  Doesn't believe that there really needs to be any security guarantee because he thinks [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1708.38s)]
*  Putin can be trusted. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1712.14s)]
*  Well, nobody in Ukraine thinks that and very few people in Europe think that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1714.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1718.9s)]
*  Peter, my final question for you is about Zelensky. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1719.9s)]
*  What based on your reporting you think he is going to do now? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1724.46s)]
*  He's been issued this offer via President Trump to return to the White House, but only [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1728.66s)]
*  as a man of peace. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1734.18s)]
*  And from everything you're saying here, what that really means is that the president wants [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1736.5s)]
*  him to return as a person willing to capitulate and recognize that the US doesn't really care [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1741.22s)]
*  as much as it once did about protecting Ukraine and that he has to live and die by Trump's [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1747.78s)]
*  hope that Putin would keep a deal that Trump makes. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1753.26s)]
*  And that means giving up a lot. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1757.7s)]
*  And so I'm curious, do you think Zelensky will return to the White House on the terms [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1759.66s)]
*  that Trump wants? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1765.3s)]
*  Or does he not return? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1767.74s)]
*  And does he instead focus on Europe as a replacement and savior for Ukraine as potentially insufficient [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1769.62s)]
*  as that might be? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1778.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really one of the essential questions out of all this. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1780.7800000000002s)]
*  Look, in the immediate aftermath of this meltdown in the Oval Office, he tried to smooth it [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1784.22s)]
*  over first with social media posts and later with an interview on Fox News and in other [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1790.3400000000001s)]
*  comments saying, you know, look, thank you, America, thank you to the president. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1794.94s)]
*  And it was him, I think, trying to smooth it over in his own way. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1799.3000000000002s)]
*  But he is a man of pride, too. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1802.44s)]
*  He's a man struggling to save his country from an aggressor. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1804.1000000000001s)]
*  And there's only so far he was willing to go. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1807.5400000000002s)]
*  He said on Fox News, he didn't think he had anything to apologize for. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1809.42s)]
*  He regretted it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1813.22s)]
*  He was sorry it happened, but he didn't think he had done anything wrong. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1814.38s)]
*  And you're right, Trump, if they put this back together, and it's possible that they [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1818.14s)]
*  do, Trump will want him to come back in a supplicant form. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1821.8200000000002s)]
*  And Vladimir Zelensky is a lot of things, but he doesn't really have the flattery gene [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1826.94s)]
*  that some of these other foreign leaders use to suck up to Trump. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1832.54s)]
*  It's just not his nature. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1837.1000000000001s)]
*  And we'll see whether or not he can do that, whether he should do that, whether that would [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1838.54s)]
*  be enough, even if he did. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1843.02s)]
*  This is the new order right now. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1845.54s)]
*  And the new order is, you know, if you are not deferential to Trump, he will punish you. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1847.3s)]
*  So for Zelensky, the choice here basically is how far is he willing to defer? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1855.82s)]
*  How far is he willing to flatter? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1862.62s)]
*  How far is he willing to subordinate himself on some level to Trump? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1865.02s)]
*  And if he did do that, would it even work? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1870.82s)]
*  Would it even get him what he really thinks he needs? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1879.1s)]
*  Well, Peter, thank you very much. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1886.5s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1888.1s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1889.1s)]
*  Great to talk with you. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1890.1s)]
*  On Sunday night, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the Trump administration's [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1895.02s)]
*  new policies towards countries like Ukraine, encapsulated by the Oval Office confrontation [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1908.34s)]
*  between Trump and Zelensky, had brought the United States much closer to Russia's own [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1915.02s)]
*  approach. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1921.54s)]
*  The spokesman said, quote, the new administration is rapidly changing all foreign policy configurations. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1923.38s)]
*  This he added, largely aligns with our vision. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1932.18s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B0qHCWvgjc&t=1942.7800000000002s)]
