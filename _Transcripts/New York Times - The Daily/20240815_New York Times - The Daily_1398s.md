# A Controversial Crackdown on Homeless Encampments
**New York Times Podcasts:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B7y-gHKopw)
*  From the New York Times, I'm Sabrina Tavernisi and this is The Daily.
*  In the weeks since a landmark Supreme Court ruling opened the door for cities and states
*  to crack down on homeless encampments, California, the state with the largest homeless population,
*  has taken some of the nation's most sweeping actions against it.
*  Today, my colleague Sean Hubler on the race to clean up what has become one of the Democratic
*  Party's biggest vulnerabilities before Election Day.
*  It's Thursday, August 15th.
*  So Sean, you've been reporting on this really remarkable moment in the long story of California
*  and homelessness.
*  Tell me about your reporting.
*  Sure.
*  So California is in many ways the nation's biggest and most sort of wrenching example
*  of homelessness.
*  Something like 180,000 people are homeless in California and most of them are living
*  without shelter.
*  Some live in cars, of course, some are couch surfing, some are in shelters, but a lot
*  of people sleep outside in California and the most visible aspect of homelessness in
*  recent years has become these encampments.
*  People who have pitched tents in all sorts of places, in parks and on sidewalks and along
*  riverbeds.
*  Right.
*  And it's a situation that's increasingly visible here.
*  So there are a lot of reasons behind it.
*  Poverty, there's mental illness, abuse, addiction, and you know, everybody's story is different.
*  But the bottom line is that it has become a really defining characteristic of cities
*  in California.
*  So that's where things stood.
*  And then came this political season.
*  We've got a major homelessness problem and the very left leaning city council and mayor
*  have the exact wrong prescriptions for that homelessness problem.
*  Which kind of intensified the challenge because these camps are not only a humanitarian issue,
*  but they're also sort of a handy political tool for people who want to criticize the
*  governance of California.
*  Our failed liberal policies as well as our bad laws that we've passed recently are just
*  simply encouraging the situation.
*  You'll often hear commentators talk about how San Francisco is poorly run.
*  And here's an example of democratic governance.
*  The homelessness is completely out of control.
*  They're not going to enforce the law.
*  They're not going to keep the streets clean.
*  They're not going to make it livable for me to allow my children to play outside of our
*  front gate without adult supervision.
*  Now, the cities are kind of hellscapes in a way and that Democrats are the ones who
*  are responsible for it.
*  City after city facing these issues, they're all run by Democrats.
*  OK, so in many ways, this place is really the face of Democrats in control and the homelessness
*  problem is right at the center of that.
*  So let's dig into that problem.
*  Why has homelessness become such a big issue in California?
*  First of all, homelessness has been a big problem in California for a long time.
*  I mean, it's an extraordinarily complicated issue.
*  It defies simple explanations.
*  But basically, it really all begins in California with extreme income inequality and a severe
*  lack of affordable housing.
*  California is one of the most expensive housing markets really in the country.
*  On top of that, there are no right to shelter laws in California like there are in the East
*  Coast. It's very difficult to force people into treatment if they're mentally ill and
*  on the street because of commitment laws in the state and the weather is temperate.
*  So you can sleep outside.
*  Local governments have a shortage of shelter beds, so a lot of reasons.
*  And for a long time, government officials in California just generally have seen homelessness
*  less as a problem that can be solved exactly than as a problem to be managed because solving
*  it was going to be very, very expensive.
*  But in 2018...
*  I've laid out a detailed homeless strategy.
*  There's been no intentionality on homelessness in this state for decades.
*  It's not been a focus of the state of California.
*  It is a disgrace.
*  It's the ultimate manifestation of our failure as a society.
*  And that has to change with the next administration.
*  Gavin Newsom was elected governor and he made homelessness one of his central and signature
*  priorities.
*  As Californians, we pride ourselves on our unwavering sense of compassion and justice
*  for humankind.
*  But there's nothing compassionate about allowing fellow Californians to live on the streets,
*  huddled in cars or makeshift encampments.
*  He called it an urgent moral issue.
*  He said it was a public health crisis.
*  No place is immune.
*  No person is untouched.
*  And he said he was going to really spend the amount of money that it was going to take
*  to finally fix it.
*  I don't think homelessness can be solved.
*  I know that homelessness can be solved.
*  Then the pandemic hit.
*  And the issue that he had brought all his attention to and that he had really promised
*  to make better exploded.
*  Downtowns emptied out.
*  Public health officials weren't sure whether it was safe to really bring homeless people
*  inside.
*  They didn't know how the virus spread.
*  Cities more or less stopped sweeping, just adopted kind of a hands-off policy.
*  And when they did that, these tent camps suddenly became a part not just of Skid Row's, but
*  of everybody's landscape in California.
*  So this kind of split screen emerged.
*  The state was dumping the most money it ever has, really, billions and billions of dollars
*  at this point, to get people into housing, to get them support for all of the various
*  problems that had put them on the street in the first place.
*  And yet the problem to people who lived here appeared the worst it has ever been.
*  The upshot was just this growing pressure on Newsom and on local politicians to clear
*  these encampments.
*  But until recently, there had been a handful of lower court decisions that limited just
*  how far cities could go.
*  And just remind us what those were.
*  Right.
*  So this was a ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers the Western
*  United States.
*  It had found that if there was no shelter available, it was unconstitutional to punish
*  people for sleeping outside if they didn't have anyplace else to go legally.
*  And Governor Newsom gradually began to see these rulings as a real impediment to making
*  progress on homelessness in California, and particularly on progress in encampments, because
*  the ruling, in his opinion, was so broad that it was hamstringing cities, that they were
*  so afraid of being sued that health and safety rules were going kind of unenforced.
*  And that was creating disease and predation and all sorts of problems for everybody, including
*  people in the encampments.
*  So the governor, through his political might, really, into helping to get the Supreme Court
*  to weigh in.
*  And, of course, the court did weigh in and, as we now know, reversed the status quo.
*  What was the effect of that ruling?
*  The outcome of this ruling is essentially that cities can enforce anti-camping restrictions
*  with less fear of being sued.
*  No longer is their ability to cite people or issue tickets tied to the availability
*  of shelter.
*  They can issue fines.
*  They can arrest people even who refuse to comply.
*  That decision had major implications for the whole country, but in California in particular,
*  it was seen as a game changer.
*  So on July 25th, Governor Newsom issued a sweeping order.
*  It directed state agencies to start clearing encampments on the state property, which is
*  vast.
*  It includes all the land under the freeways, for example, and parks and so on.
*  And the governor also urged cities and counties to do the same.
*  He offered them guidelines that he said would be legal and efficient.
*  And he said, humane.
*  The playbook would be to give two days' notice to people who were camped outside, offer them
*  services, connect them with outreach workers and shelters and housing providers before
*  you move them.
*  Gather their belongings, offer to store them for 90 or 60 days so they could come back
*  and retrieve them later on.
*  But what was unsaid is that in a lot of jurisdictions, if campers didn't comply, they might now be
*  subject to a citation and maybe even arrest.
*  Okay, so some pretty tough new tools, especially in a place like California that had traditionally
*  been pretty lenient on this issue.
*  Newsom orders this action.
*  What happens?
*  Well, for all the talk of compassion, right?
*  You know, patience was thin and gloves were off.
*  Some cities announced they were warming up the bulldozers.
*  And San Francisco, Mayor London Breed, who is facing a very tough reelection, in part
*  because of homeless encampments, went directly to an encampment that was outside of a DMV
*  office in San Francisco and stood there while city workers started to clear it.
*  She told local authorities there that she not only wanted these encampments cleared,
*  she wanted them to start offering bus tickets to people who had a connection elsewhere.
*  Like bus tickets actually literally to ship them out of the state.
*  If they have connections there, yes.
*  Because as it stands, California still doesn't have enough beds for all of its homeless people.
*  The shelters are stressed, permanent housing is often full.
*  And so cities are looking for any measure they can take to try to ease the situation.
*  But not every place in the state reacted as quickly or as enthusiastically as Newsom's
*  hometown of San Francisco.
*  Most notably, Los Angeles County, which has a huge homeless population and tremendous
*  sway in the state.
*  And that put the largest metropolis in California and California's governor on a collision course.
*  We'll be right back.
*  So Sean, you said that the biggest city in the state, Los Angeles, was skeptical of Newsom's
*  order.
*  Tell me about that.
*  So Los Angeles County is an enormous place.
*  The county has 10 million people roughly, and the city of Los Angeles within it has
*  something like 4 million.
*  And they are in many ways, as an electorate, more liberal than the state overall.
*  And the supervisors in Los Angeles County react to Newsom's directive by saying, we're
*  not going to change anything.
*  And by the way, we're not going to criminalize homelessness.
*  We're not going to put anybody in jail.
*  We're going to continue to do it our way.
*  We have a lot of homeless people here, and if we dismantle these encampments, that's
*  fine, but it doesn't do anybody any good to just move them down the street.
*  We are not going to move anybody until we have a bed to put them in or a place to send
*  them or a program to put them in.
*  So their view is that they are slowly but steadily going to bring people in inside,
*  and they have been coaxing people in more with carrots than with sticks to shelter.
*  And they have made some progress.
*  The city of Los Angeles has made something like a 10% dent in the number of unsheltered
*  homeless people over the past year.
*  And the county overall has made a dent of about 5% in the number of unsheltered homeless
*  people, and that's a significant number of people and it's a significant dent, but it
*  hasn't happened very quickly.
*  And that is in direct contrast to what Newsom is trying to accomplish here.
*  So what does Newsom do?
*  How does he respond to this kind of intransigence from LA?
*  So last week, roughly two weeks after the order is issued, Newsom goes down to San Diego
*  to welcome some pandas to the zoo.
*  And while he's in Southern California, a couple of hours later, he emerges 130 miles up the
*  freeway in Los Angeles in a homeless encampment, saying in so many words, you don't want to
*  clean your house?
*  I'll come to your house.
*  I'll clean up the situation for you.
*  The camp where Governor Newsom is coming today is under a freeway overpass, Interstate 10.
*  So I went to the encampment knowing that he was going to be there and we're walking in,
*  we're looking around, there's trash everywhere, strewn everywhere.
*  It was just heartbreaking actually.
*  There was trash everywhere, rats, junk.
*  And I'm seeing in the corner here a man who's asleep on what appears to be a trampoline.
*  There was a man passed out in a corner and lying on what appeared to be a broken trampoline
*  that a kid might use, remains of campfires.
*  Hello, excuse me.
*  Hi.
*  I'm not...
*  Wow.
*  That is a cool looking car.
*  And I spoke to the neighbors around, people who lived in the working class neighborhood
*  kind of around there.
*  I know homeless been around.
*  Yeah, they've been around since forever.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah, but...
*  And they were really unhappy.
*  I came to work in the morning and then I just seen a whole bunch of fire and I'm like, whoa,
*  a bunch of smoke.
*  So I had to call them.
*  And then once I was on the phone with them, they're like, oh, we already have three, four
*  calls already about that.
*  We're on our way.
*  They said that the fire department was there all the time, that they felt very sorry for
*  the people who were living in this encampment, but it was just untenable.
*  Just kind of like dangerous to walk in the nighttime, especially.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Because I worked there.
*  It was hard for them to feel safe walking down the street or let alone going out with
*  their children.
*  Governor, hello.
*  Sean will have an audio.
*  Be careful what you say.
*  Yes, I do have audio.
*  So a few hours after I got there, the governor arrived with his crew of state workers in
*  their orange vests and their hard hats.
*  And he began picking up trash.
*  Hey, tell me what you're doing here.
*  Just part and parcel of the work we continue to do to try to clean up the state.
*  He said that it was not just Los Angeles County, but counties all over California who needed
*  to get serious now.
*  Now that he had done his part, they needed to be good partners, too.
*  What I want now?
*  I want to see results.
*  It's not about inputs.
*  It's about seeing, physically seeing the results.
*  And that's what we're doing.
*  And he said that he was looking for accountability and that he wanted to see action.
*  He wanted to see movement.
*  Little County would be more determinative in whether or not we're successful than L.A.
*  County.
*  What do you want from L.A. County?
*  What is it that they are not doing?
*  I think right now it's not an indictment of any one.
*  I think perhaps that's the issue.
*  There's no one.
*  That's the issue of counties generally.
*  Uh huh.
*  It's abuse accountability.
*  But for me, it's about urgency.
*  It's just a different level of urgency.
*  And the governor also reminded county leaders throughout the state that they rely on the
*  state for many, many billions of dollars of funding and that the state can give it and
*  the state can take it away.
*  And that he was planning to reward financially counties who followed his playbook and that
*  he was willing to take money away from counties that weren't using the funding he was giving
*  them that weren't enacting his programs to show progress.
*  And he also pointed out that this had national implications for his party.
*  You heard the president just mocking Kamala Harris in California.
*  It's about this.
*  That the Democratic nominee for the presidency, Kamala Harris, was already being attacked
*  about California homelessness.
*  So this is pretty remarkable.
*  You have a Democratic governor going into LA territory to Democratic officials' backyard
*  and really pointing the finger at them and saying, hey, you know, some of you aren't
*  getting the job done and we're going to do this my way.
*  Yeah, that was pretty radical.
*  But you know, it's worth noting that only a handful of people were living in these encampments.
*  The governor went to two encampments that day.
*  There were something like, I don't know, 22 people, something like that.
*  About half a dozen of them accepted some form of housing or shelter from local homeless
*  outreach groups.
*  And the leaders in Los Angeles County reacted kind of tellingly, too.
*  On background, people told me, you know, look, this appears to be a little more than a stunt
*  because it's only proven that this is a long and hard process.
*  Look at how hard he worked.
*  He spent the entire day cleaning up homeless encampments.
*  And he got six people into shelter and he cleaned up two spots.
*  And someone else made the point that, look, you know, even after you clean out an encampment,
*  the studies show that they'll just come back unless you have everything lined up, services
*  and housing for them and guarantees that they can transition into a different way of living.
*  And so it's a long and arduous and tedious process.
*  And there's no fast way of doing it right.
*  You know, it's interesting hearing you talk about this conflict.
*  It strikes me that everyone involved here, the governor, local officials, for the most
*  part, they're all Democrats who all want the same thing.
*  They see this as a problem that needs to be solved.
*  But the question is how exactly to do that and how fast to do that.
*  That's right.
*  And Sabrina, it's also worth noting that the Supreme Court decision came only about
*  a month and a half ago.
*  So this is really early stages, right, of this new era in California when it comes to
*  dealing with its homelessness crisis.
*  And while we've seen a huge amount of activity, really, in the time since the Supreme Court's
*  ruling, everybody, including the governor, even if he doesn't say so publicly, knows
*  that this is really only the beginning.
*  It's going to take a very long time to solve this.
*  Which might not be fast enough for Democratic officials or for the party's presidential
*  nominee.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Problems like this don't necessarily fit into political or campaign timelines.
*  Sean, thank you.
*  My pleasure.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Here's what you should know today.
*  On Wednesday, the government released inflation data that provided fresh evidence that the
*  central measure of American prices is moderating.
*  The consumer price index was 2.9 percent in July on a yearly basis, down from 3 percent
*  in June.
*  The rate was still faster than the 2 percent pace that was normal before the coronavirus
*  pandemic.
*  It was the first time since 2021 that inflation had slipped below 3 percent.
*  The measure leaves the Federal Reserve firmly on track to cut interest rates at its next
*  meeting in September.
*  And Columbia University's president, Nimad Shafik, resigned on Wednesday over her handling
*  of pro-Palestinian demonstrations and questions over her management of a bitterly divided
*  campus.
*  She was the third leader of an Ivy League university to resign in about eight months.
*  Shafik, an economist who spent much of her career in London, said in a letter that after
*  reflecting over the summer, she had come to the conclusion that resigning, quote, would
*  best enable Columbia to traverse the challenges ahead.
