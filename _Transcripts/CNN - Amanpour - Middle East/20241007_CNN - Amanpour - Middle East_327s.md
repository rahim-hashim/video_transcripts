Video Description: One year ago today, at 6:29am, Hamas invaded Israel. The attack involved the most heinous of crimes: the murder of more than 1,000 people -- mostly civilians -- and the taking of 250 hostages, scores of whom are still captive today. Ceremonies across Israel began at precisely 6:29 this morning, in remembrance of the tragedy and loss to the nation. There were also protests at the government's failure to uphold a unique contract with its people: to never leave anyone behind and to bring every hostage home, no matter the cost. Some hostage families held their own event critical of Prime Minister Netanyahu, while the government created its own pre-recorded tribute. Romi Gonen, 23, was taken hostage that horrific day from the Nova music festival. She spent her 24th birthday in captivity. Every day Romi's mother, Meirav, fights to bring her home from Gaza. Meirav spoke with Christiane for the first time in late October last year. She joins the show again today from Tel Aviv.

# “Agonizing:” Mother of Hamas Hostage on Oct 7 and a Year Without Her Daughter | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk)
*  And I want to ask you how you are. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=0.0s)]
*  How you are. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=3.64s)]
*  Wow, it's a big question. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=7.08s)]
*  First, thank you for hosting me today. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=9.92s)]
*  This is such an important issue to talk today [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  and remind everybody that there are still people kept alive. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=17.16s)]
*  And some of them are already murdered in Hamas hands [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=22.66s)]
*  for a year. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=26.94s)]
*  This is agonizing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=28.24s)]
*  I cannot even explain how you feel when you wake up [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=32.16s)]
*  in the morning and for the first moments you hope this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=36.56s)]
*  is only a nightmare, a dream, a bad dream. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=40.36s)]
*  But then you are waking up to a reality. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=44.64s)]
*  Out of my five kids, I have one kid, which I didn't hear [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  her voice for a year. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  I don't know how she looks like today, how she's holding up. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=56.44s)]
*  Did she lost her hand because she was shot on that day? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=61.0s)]
*  Is she smiling like she's always smile? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=65.72s)]
*  And this is so agonizing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=69.44s)]
*  It's so difficult. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=71.88s)]
*  Mirav, you've just explained to us [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  how she was not just kidnapped but shot that day. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=80.4s)]
*  And you actually did manage to get a call into her [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=83.92s)]
*  or somehow you guys connected as this terrible thing was [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=89.6s)]
*  happening. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=93.52s)]
*  And we have got your permission to play a little bit of that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=94.2s)]
*  And it's pretty traumatic. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=99.16s)]
*  And we're going to play a little bit of your conversation [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=100.88s)]
*  the last time you spoke to your daughter. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=103.5s)]
*  So that was your side of the conversation, Mirav. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=113.92s)]
*  I see your eyes are closed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=142.08s)]
*  Was she able to say anything to you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=147.52s)]
*  She's leaving. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  She spoke at first. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=153.44s)]
*  She was calling me at 1014 that morning. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=155.28s)]
*  We were on the phone for almost four and a half hours. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=159.0s)]
*  But the last call started at 1014 when she was calling me [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=162.72000000000003s)]
*  and saying that she was shot, that her friend, her best [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=168.2s)]
*  friend was murdered, the driver was murdered, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=172.2s)]
*  and that another boy in the car is also shot. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=176.48s)]
*  She was bleeding. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=180.84s)]
*  She was sure she was going to die. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=182.0s)]
*  And you can hear the shooting around the car. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=184.72s)]
*  This is my 20. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=187.92s)]
*  She was 23. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=189.84s)]
*  Now she's already 24. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=191.24s)]
*  She's my kid. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=192.76s)]
*  She's my baby with a lot of Hamas terrorists around her [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=194.0s)]
*  shouting. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=198.52s)]
*  45 minutes, which at first she was speaking. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=200.88s)]
*  She was telling me what is going around. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=204.0s)]
*  And then at a certain minute she was hushing me. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=206.48s)]
*  And I just listened. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=210.32s)]
*  And I listened to the shooting around her too, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=212.04s)]
*  to the terrorist shouting and dragging her out of the car. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=215.24s)]
*  She's just a girl. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=222.36s)]
*  She just wanted to be in the festival. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=223.76s)]
*  And I think we have to remember that this is not an issue [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  between Palestine and Israel. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  This is an issue between the Hamas, which [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=235.72s)]
*  is a terror organization which terrorizes also the Gaza [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=242.6s)]
*  This is something which threatened the whole world, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  not just in Israel. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=246.12s)]
*  It started in Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=247.76s)]
*  It happened in Israel. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  And we are fighting back. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=250.56s)]
*  But this is something the whole world should take responsibility [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=252.32s)]
*  as the world does. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=256.92s)]
*  Maybe this is the place to say thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for you for understanding that this is not [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=261.04s)]
*  just Israel fight. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=264.4s)]
*  And you see what is going around us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=265.52s)]
*  I live at the north. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=267.88s)]
*  Just today on the 7th of October, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=269.32s)]
*  the houses around my house were shot by missiles [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=271.92s)]
*  from Hezbollah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=276.88s)]
*  So you can understand this is where we're a small country. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=278.2s)]
*  We have so many terror organizations around us [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=282.0s)]
*  that want to eliminate us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=284.88s)]
*  And thank you for being there for us. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=286.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think this is exactly what will help us win, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  because we need to push the Hamas very strongly. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=293.0s)]
*  Us, the free countries, the democracies, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=296.0s)]
*  we have to fight the Hamas and push him and let him know [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=300.0s)]
*  that we will not break, because we are the good. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=303.64s)]
*  And the Hamas is evil, evil also to the Gaza people. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6aIp_Cu0vk&t=307.2s)]
