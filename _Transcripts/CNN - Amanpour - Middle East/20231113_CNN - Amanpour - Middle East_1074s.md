Video Description: As American Jews face an unprecedented surge in antisemitism, they are also grappling with division in their own communities. The debate over support for Israel is playing out among Jews across the country, with some calling for a ceasefire while others unequivocally back the Israeli government. Journalist and author Emily Tamkin explains this moment of division and highlights the importance of listening to one another during this period of pain and grief.

*  for joining us. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=36.58s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=37.74s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=38.14s)]
*  You wrote this recent piece for [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=39.74s)]
*  Slate that really caught our [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=41.28s)]
*  attention, and you started by [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=43.44s)]
*  describing anti-Semitic [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=46.04s)]
*  incidents that you've [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=47.8s)]
*  experienced from the time you [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=48.54s)]
*  were a little kid. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=50.7s)]
*  And so, for people who've never [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=52.3s)]
*  experienced that or don't know [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=54.18s)]
*  anybody who has, would you just [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=56.3s)]
*  tell us, like, one or two of the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=58.14s)]
*  things that you started your [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=59.24s)]
*  piece with? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=60.38s)]
*  I started the piece with an [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=61.14s)]
*  incident from when I was in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=62.18s)]
*  elementary school that I still [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=63.2s)]
*  remember to this day, which was [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=64.68s)]
*  somebody who had drawn a swastika [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  on a bathroom stall. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=67.58s)]
*  And there was this big assembly. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=68.54s)]
*  And as a child, you don't totally [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=70.08s)]
*  understand what's going on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=71.88s)]
*  But I do remember just sobbing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=72.98s)]
*  in the car later on because [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=74.54s)]
*  the idea that somebody could [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=77.18s)]
*  have this sort of hate toward [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=78.28s)]
*  Jews, including myself, was [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  really heartbreaking. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=82.38s)]
*  And when you see that at a very [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  young age and you experience [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  that at a very young age, it [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=87.14s)]
*  really, I think, can help shape [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=89.42s)]
*  your identity in a way that's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=92.04s)]
*  quite defensive and quite [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=93.04s)]
*  reactive. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=94.98s)]
*  And so I've always been very [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=95.64s)]
*  proud to be Jewish. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=98.24s)]
*  But I think for many years as a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=99.24s)]
*  young person, I really thought of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=100.74s)]
*  that as being about fighting and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=102.58s)]
*  standing up to anti-Semitism. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=106.58s)]
*  And I still think that that is a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=108.14s)]
*  part of Jewishness and Jewish [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=109.32s)]
*  identity. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=110.98s)]
*  But I also think that only [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=111.52s)]
*  defining yourself through other [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=113.92s)]
*  people's hatred and only [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  defining yourself through your [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=116.52s)]
*  fear can be quite limiting and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=118.2s)]
*  quite reductive. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=121.61999999999999s)]
*  And if you're not careful, can [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=122.42s)]
*  close you off to also seeing the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=123.96s)]
*  pain and the fear that others [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=126.19999999999999s)]
*  are experiencing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=128.06s)]
*  For people who haven't had a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=129.06s)]
*  chance to read it yet, and I [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=129.92s)]
*  hope that they will, you say, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=130.96s)]
*  what should American Jews do [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=132.56s)]
*  with our fear? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=134.26s)]
*  We're scared. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=135.16s)]
*  But right now, we have to be [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=136.16s)]
*  more than that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=137.4s)]
*  So if you just start by telling [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=138.3s)]
*  me, why did you want to start [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=140.0s)]
*  the piece that way? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=141.1s)]
*  And why did you want to write [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=142.16s)]
*  this piece to begin with? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=143.01999999999998s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=144.5s)]
*  I started the piece with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=145.22s)]
*  acknowledging my own history [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=147.32s)]
*  with anti-Semitism and my own [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=148.62s)]
*  fear and and and more broadly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=149.85999999999999s)]
*  with the fear that I know that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=152.4s)]
*  many American Jews are feeling [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=153.5s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=154.8s)]
*  According to a recent study that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=155.8s)]
*  came out after this piece by the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=157.2s)]
*  Jewish Federations of North [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=159.2s)]
*  America, 70 percent of American [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=160.1s)]
*  Jews feel more afraid and have [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=161.9s)]
*  and are a barrier of increased [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=164.36s)]
*  anti-Semitism right now with [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=166.2s)]
*  Israel's ongoing war, the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=168.4s)]
*  horrific attack by Hamas and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=171.2s)]
*  Israel, Israel's ongoing war. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=172.36s)]
*  And I started with that because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=175.06s)]
*  I do think that it's important [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=176.36s)]
*  to acknowledge that people are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=178.0s)]
*  scared and that there are real [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=179.84s)]
*  threats to American Jews right [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=181.76s)]
*  now and that I think we should [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=184.0s)]
*  speak up against those and call [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  out anti-Semitism where we see [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=188.4s)]
*  it and not but that that fear [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=189.6s)]
*  is not the only fear that's [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  being experienced right now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=195.3s)]
*  That is not the only pain that's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=196.5s)]
*  being experienced right now. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=197.86s)]
*  And again, I think that fear can [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=199.9s)]
*  do one of two things. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=201.24s)]
*  It can make you quite quite [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=202.16s)]
*  tribal and sort of only [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=203.64s)]
*  recognize your fear and your [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  community's fear or [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=206.64s)]
*  alternatively in a sad way, it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  can be an opening, an [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  opportunity. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  So I know that especially on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=212.32s)]
*  college campuses that many [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=213.83999999999997s)]
*  American Jews, you know, they're [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=214.98s)]
*  away from home, they're they're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=216.44s)]
*  quite young, they're [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=217.54s)]
*  experienced, they're processing [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=218.32s)]
*  all of this on their own. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=219.38s)]
*  I know that that fear is real, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=222.51999999999998s)]

*  historical precedent for this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=509.54s)]

*  as I said, Israel really since [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=511.68s)]

*  And as the reality on the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=522.58s)]
*  ground in Israel has changed, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=525.46s)]

*  comfortable with that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=530.48s)]

*  we were in this moment of push [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=533.22s)]

*  and what will be and sort of [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=537.12s)]
*  the it's it's a political [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=539.82s)]

*  dispute. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=543.38s)]
*  Interestingly, for the past, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=545.82s)]
*  for much of the past year, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=547.12s)]
*  because the current Israeli [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=548.08s)]

*  In that moment, you want to [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=582.08s)]

*  Jewish history. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=678.28s)]
*  I think that's completely valid. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=679.42s)]
*  However, we should also note that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=681.04s)]
*  we are afforded protections [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=682.72s)]
*  by the state that and that [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=684.54s)]
*  that has not always been the case [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=686.24s)]
*  in [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=687.64s)]
*  in American Jewish or in Jewish [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=689.24s)]
*  history. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=690.64s)]
*  That's that's a very important [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=691.24s)]
*  distinction. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=692.92s)]
*  We are not being discriminated [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=694.28s)]
*  against by the state. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=695.52s)]
*  And so I think, you know, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=696.68s)]
*  to hear a member of Congress [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=699.78s)]
*  call for Palestinians to be [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=701.74s)]
*  deported from this country [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=703.08s)]
*  or to hear Islamophobia [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=704.78s)]
*  not be as forcefully denounced [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=706.34s)]
*  by political leaders [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=709.14s)]
*  or by people in the media [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=710.34s)]
*  or, you know, I'm a member [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=711.8199999999999s)]
*  of the media, so I'm chastising my [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=713.54s)]
*  own. But generally, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=714.78s)]
*  you know, it's personal, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=717.68s)]
*  but it's also political. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=718.8199999999999s)]
*  And [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=719.98s)]
*  the freedom of assembly [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=722.24s)]
*  and the right to political [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=723.54s)]
*  expression, you know, that's [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=724.68s)]
*  I want that for American Jews, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=726.62s)]
*  but not only for American Jews. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=728.22s)]
*  You know, one of the things that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=730.4s)]
*  sort of struck me is that [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=731.12s)]
*  is that how [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=732.5s)]
*  some of the people who've spoken [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=735.1600000000001s)]
*  out about [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=737.22s)]
*  what happened on October 7th [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=739.26s)]
*  have really spoken to the sense [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=740.52s)]
*  of being alone or feeling alone [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=741.6600000000001s)]
*  like nobody else cares. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=743.6s)]
*  And one of the points you make [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=745.1s)]
*  in your piece is that, yeah, a [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=746.1s)]
*  lot of people care. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=747.1s)]
*  Jewish people in America are not [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  alone. You know, the president of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=750.0s)]
*  the United States has expressed [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=751.2s)]
*  his solidarity and and [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=752.72s)]
*  concern and care. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=754.2s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=755.1600000000001s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, like, what [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=756.0s)]
*  do you think that the divide, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=757.02s)]
*  what other divides are there apart [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=758.6999999999999s)]
*  from generation? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=760.72s)]
*  Is it that some people [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=761.52s)]
*  still feel very alone and don't see [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=763.3s)]
*  allies or what do you think it is? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=765.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I think [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=767.22s)]
*  you're completely correct to [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=768.66s)]
*  to point out that it's not only [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=771.12s)]
*  generational. You know, I've [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=772.36s)]
*  spoken to people who are much older [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  than me, who have expressed [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=774.96s)]
*  real concern over what's happening [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=777.12s)]
*  to Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=778.6s)]
*  I've spoken to people my age [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=779.56s)]
*  or younger who have who [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=781.46s)]
*  have, let's say, are [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  to my right on some of these [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=785.5s)]
*  issues. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=786.86s)]
*  I think, you know, and I think [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=788.64s)]
*  some would say, well, it's about [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=790.7s)]
*  how close they are to Israel [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=791.96s)]
*  because, you know, roughly half [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=794.8000000000001s)]
*  of American Jews have never been to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=796.8000000000001s)]
*  Israel. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=798.54s)]
*  And so if you [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=799.7s)]
*  if you feel a closer tie to that [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=802.1s)]
*  country, to the country, if you have [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=803.34s)]
*  friends there, if you have family [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=805.04s)]
*  there, that can also [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=806.2s)]
*  impact your decision. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=808.46s)]
*  Although I should say that many of [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=809.24s)]
*  the people I know who are most [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  critical of Israel are critical [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=811.86s)]
*  because they spent as much time [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=813.94s)]
*  there as they have. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=815.3000000000001s)]
*  We should also note, I mean, there [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  there there are several [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=819.0600000000001s)]
*  factors. So most American Jews, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=821.2s)]
*  their families came over in the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=823.34s)]
*  19th or 20th centuries and they're [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=824.6s)]
*  descended from Central and Eastern [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=825.9s)]
*  Europeans. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=827.0600000000001s)]
*  There are also American Jews whose [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=828.4s)]
*  families came over later. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=830.0s)]
*  So, for example, Persian [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=831.0s)]
*  Jews who escaped Iran or [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=832.94s)]
*  Jews who left the former Soviet [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=835.1s)]
*  Union, they're like they are [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=836.26s)]
*  or many are like they are to have [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=838.0s)]
*  family in Israel and many are [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=840.2s)]
*  closer to their own sort of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=842.1s)]
*  perceived moment of not perceived [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=843.3000000000001s)]
*  their own moment of trauma and [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=844.9s)]
*  departure. And so the state of [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=846.16s)]
*  Israel looms larger [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=847.3s)]
*  in their in their Jewishness and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=849.36s)]
*  their own understanding [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=851.4s)]
*  of self. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=853.6s)]
*  And so it's I don't think you can [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=855.6s)]
*  point to any one thing. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=857.0s)]
*  One of the things you point out in [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=859.6s)]
*  your piece is that these are these [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=860.56s)]
*  kinds of conversations take place [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=861.92s)]
*  in Israel all the time and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=863.1999999999999s)]
*  especially among people who spend [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  a lot of time there. So I just kind [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=866.62s)]
*  of wonder why why you feel like [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=867.8399999999999s)]
*  people who are here in the United [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=869.4599999999999s)]
*  States feel kind of entitled to [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=870.64s)]
*  be so. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=873.16s)]
*  Sensorious about it, you know what I [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=874.24s)]
*  mean? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=875.9s)]
*  Yeah, I think that I mean, first of [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=876.92s)]
*  all, I don't want to overstate the [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  size of the Israeli left or how [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=879.86s)]
*  many in Israel are calling for a [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=881.64s)]
*  ceasefire. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=882.9399999999999s)]
*  I do think that often people [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=884.7199999999999s)]
*  that often Israelis are far far [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=886.88s)]
*  more critical of the Israeli [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=888.56s)]
*  government and of what the state [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=889.9599999999999s)]
*  is doing than people in the United [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=892.0s)]
*  States. There are two reasons for [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=893.64s)]
*  this. The first is that I think [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=894.8s)]
*  many American Jews see it as well. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=896.36s)]
*  It's not that it's not my place, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=897.8s)]
*  right? They're living there so [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=899.0799999999999s)]
*  they can criticize. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm here. So I should I can't [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=901.0799999999999s)]
*  and and if I do, it will sort of [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=903.16s)]
*  allow other Americans to criticize [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=905.16s)]
*  Israel. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=907.0s)]
*  And I think the second thing is [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=909.0s)]
*  that for many American Jews, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=910.2399999999999s)]
*  Israel is. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=911.56s)]
*  I want to be careful how I say [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=914.4799999999999s)]
*  this, but I do think that for many [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=916.2399999999999s)]
*  American Jews, Israel is still an [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=917.52s)]
*  idea as well as a country. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=919.2399999999999s)]
*  And that's not to say that any [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=920.92s)]
*  American Jews who care passionately [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=921.8399999999999s)]
*  about it don't have family there, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  don't spend a lot of time there, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=924.76s)]
*  don't have friends there, of [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=926.28s)]
*  course. But. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  But I think that's the first [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=930.3599999999999s)]
*  but I do think that there is a [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=932.08s)]
*  tendency in American [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=933.48s)]
*  Jewish politics to [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=935.8s)]
*  to speak of an Israel that is [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=939.08s)]
*  somewhat divorced from what's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=940.28s)]
*  happening on the ground. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=941.4s)]
*  And there are people who spend much [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=943.88s)]
*  more time on Israel, particularly [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=945.56s)]
*  than I do, who have said the same. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=947.36s)]
*  So I feel comfortable saying that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=949.0s)]
*  And I think that's I think that's a [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=951.24s)]
*  difference as well. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=952.64s)]
*  Did you hesitate before writing [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=953.6s)]
*  this piece? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=954.92s)]
*  I did. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=956.52s)]
*  You know, I first want to say that, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=958.36s)]
*  you know, of course, this is a [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=960.7199999999999s)]
*  challenging time to be a writer or [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=962.6s)]
*  a journalist, but I'm not [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=964.24s)]
*  in Israel and I'm not in Gaza. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=966.4s)]
*  And I just I just think that as [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=968.52s)]
*  an American journalist, I feel a [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=969.68s)]
*  responsibility to acknowledge that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=971.8s)]
*  there are people who are actually [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=973.0799999999999s)]
*  in like that. That's actually [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=974.24s)]
*  challenging. That's actual danger. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=976.16s)]
*  I hesitated because I [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=979.4s)]
*  not even so much that, oh, what if [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=982.04s)]
*  people yell at me? But I do want [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=983.52s)]
*  to be sensitive to this moment, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=985.4399999999999s)]
*  it's the pain that people are in [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=986.9599999999999s)]
*  and to the fear that people are [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  experiencing. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=989.28s)]
*  And ultimately, I decided to write [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=990.6s)]
*  it not despite that, but because [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=992.16s)]
*  of it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=993.96s)]
*  Say more. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=996.0s)]
*  Because I think that. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=997.64s)]
*  I think that it is important to [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1001.5600000000001s)]
*  acknowledge American Jewish fear [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1002.8s)]
*  and American Jewish pain. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1004.24s)]
*  And I also think it's important [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1005.6800000000001s)]
*  to encourage people to see [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1007.96s)]
*  that not as a reason to. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1009.92s)]
*  To turn ourselves off from [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1014.4s)]
*  the feelings of others or to shut [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1017.4s)]
*  down foreign policy debate. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1019.12s)]
*  You know, I really [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1020.64s)]
*  it's because I want to be sensitive [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1022.96s)]
*  in fear and pain that I think it's [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1024.48s)]
*  important to both acknowledge it [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1025.52s)]
*  and also to ask people [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1027.12s)]
*  to consider it as an opportunity [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1029.28s)]
*  to to hear others narratives [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1031.28s)]
*  and to hear their pain and their [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1033.44s)]
*  fear. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1034.8s)]
*  And that. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1036.44s)]
*  I, you know, speaking only [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1038.72s)]
*  for myself as an American Jew, I do [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1040.52s)]
*  not want my fear to be used [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1042.2s)]
*  to chill speech or discussion. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1044.24s)]
*  And so I felt a responsibility [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1046.76s)]
*  with a small platform that I have in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1049.56s)]
*  that way to to put that forth. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1051.0s)]
*  At least I'm good. Thanks so much [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1055.08s)]
*  for talking with us. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1056.1599999999999s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rv9RmF9q7o&t=1057.4399999999998s)]
