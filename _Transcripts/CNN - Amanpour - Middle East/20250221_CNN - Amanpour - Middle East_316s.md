Video Description: In the face of President Trump's plans for Ukraine, leaders around the world are looking for ways to shore up their positions. European leaders met in two emergency summits to discuss a unified response while ensuring their place at the table. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer calls this a "once-in-a-generation moment" for national security. Trump's vision of owning Gaza also has world leaders on edge. It was in this context that Christiane spoke with European Commission Vice President and former Estonian leader Kaja Kallas, and Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, onstage at the Munich Security Conference.

# Global Security at Crossroads: Ukraine, Gaza and U.S. Foreign Policy | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [February 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc)
*  I want to ask about the two raging issues in the world right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=0.0s)]
*  The war in Europe, the war in the Middle East, and how we're all affected by it. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=4.4s)]
*  President Trump's peace plans for both Ukraine and Gaza are without the Ukrainians and without the Palestinians. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=10.08s)]
*  Any deal for it to work, Ukrainians need to agree to this. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=18.32s)]
*  That is very clear. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=23.44s)]
*  And when we look at this whole process, then it's not really sure. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=24.959999999999997s)]
*  They are talking about what is the deal really. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  I think right now the most important thing is that Putin doesn't really want peace. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=34.16s)]
*  So I think we should put the efforts there that they would want peace. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=40.16s)]
*  Why do you think that he does not want peace? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  If he wants peace, he could just simply stop bombing Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=46.8s)]
*  I mean, that is as simple as that, but he's not doing that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=51.44s)]
*  So a similar question to you, Foreign Minister. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=54.88s)]
*  Obviously, the whole crisis over 15 months set off by October 7th and the war of avenging, of self-defense by Israel. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=59.76s)]
*  Again, President Trump has said, for instance, that particularly about Gaza, that we'll have it, it's ours, we'll take care of it. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=72.08s)]
*  We'll make the Riviera of the Middle East. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=79.52s)]
*  And furthermore, has asked, insisted, expected your country and Egypt to take some two million Palestinians. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  Your reaction right now, today, after all these days of having to deal with this? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  President Trump, bottom line is saying that he wants to bring about peace to the region. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=97.36s)]
*  And we say we are partners. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=101.28s)]
*  We've been working, striving to have that peace for decades. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  But in order to have that peace, a deal by definition, going back to your question, is a deal that is concluded to the satisfaction of both parties. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=108.48s)]
*  Our view in Jordan is the only way that you can have just and lasting peace in the region is to end occupation and have a sovereign, independent Palestinian state on Palestinian national soil on the basis of June 4, 1967 lines, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=117.68s)]
*  living in peace and security with Israel that is accepted and normalized within the region. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  To get to do that, you're not going to be able to do that by not addressing the core issue of conflict, which is that you do have Palestinian people who are attached to their land, want to stay on their land. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=139.44s)]
*  And on the issue of displacement, again, President Trump said that he's driven by humanitarian concern, that he believes you cannot rebuild Gaza while the people of Gaza are there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Our position is that we have a plan that shows that we can do it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=159.28s)]
*  And remember, this is not the first time we have such amount of suffering and destruction in Gaza. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  Last time around, the amount of destruction was 50 percent of the current destruction, and yet Gaza was rebuilt. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  But beyond that, in order for us to avoid reliving the horrors of October 7 and since October 7, we've got to find peace. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=173.76s)]
*  The only path to peace is to address the legitimate rights of both parties. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=182.32s)]
*  And we don't believe that displacement would do that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=185.76s)]
*  So just to answer you unequivocally, we have 35 percent of our population are refugees. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=187.84s)]
*  We cannot afford any more. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=192.32s)]
*  I think it's very important that we get the governance of Gaza right, because that means that the security of the region and that also means the rights of both parties there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  And we as the European Union really want to be part of that discussion, because we are the biggest supporters of Palestinian authority. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=206.56s)]
*  We are the biggest supporters of UNRWA for the Palestinian refugees. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  So I think we are also the reasonable and reliable partner. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=218.88s)]
*  Vice President JD Vance delivered a pretty tough speech, should we say, to Europe, pretty much scolded Europe. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  Essentially said that the biggest threat he saw was European internal politics, that you're not listening to your people. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=231.04s)]
*  And therefore, we have this big problem and this big weakness. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=239.11999999999998s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=243.84s)]
*  When we meet in person, then we have very good and frank discussions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  So the US is a great ally, and they are also saying that they keep or they remain our great ally. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=250.48s)]
*  When you know, listening to that speech, it seems like, you know, they try to pick a fight with us, but we don't want to fight with our friends. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=257.6s)]
*  We have other threats coming from outside. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=265.44s)]
*  And I think, you know, in domestic politics, we have all kinds of issues and we are settling those ourselves. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=268.24s)]
*  But we need to work with our allies with the bigger threats that there are in the world that we have together with the United States regarding, you know, Russia attacking Ukraine or, you know, the international order really not functioning. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=274.72s)]
*  Are there aggressors in the world having appetite for their neighbors' countries, critical raw materials, the protection of these? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=289.68s)]
*  I mean, there are so many issues that we can work on and will work on. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCh6V8etTcc&t=296.64s)]
