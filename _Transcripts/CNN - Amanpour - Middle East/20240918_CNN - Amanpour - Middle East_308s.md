Video Description: Walkie-talkies exploded today in Lebanon, a day after Israel remotely detonated Hezbollah's network of pagers. Israel's Defense Minister says a new phase of war is beginning, and that the center of gravity is moving north. The two surprise attacks killed more than a dozen people and injured thousands. Hezbollah is vowing revenge. The group, designated a terrorist organization by the West, is actually also a powerful political party with some thirteen seats in the Lebanese parliament. Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib joins the program from Beirut.

# Lebanese Foreign Minister Addresses Device Attacks Against Hezbollah | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [September 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA)
*  Foreign Minister Abdullah Abu Habib was the country's ambassador to the United States, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=0.0s)]
*  also worked once as the economist at the World Bank, and he is now joining us from Beirut. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Welcome to the program, Foreign Minister. What do you know is going on? What's happening right now [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=10.72s)]
*  in your country? Well, you described it a little bit, and it is worse than one can say. There are [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=16.16s)]
*  a lot of people who were being killed, and a lot of people injured, and a lot of them named for good. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=23.2s)]
*  So it's a very hard situation, and I don't know what Israel's intention is. I don't think they can [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=30.08s)]
*  return those refugees who went from their villages in the north in this way, because Israel was in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=37.12s)]
*  Lebanon and had to run away in Lebanon. Of course, they stayed 22 years, but there were too many [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  killings of Israelis there. So I don't think Israel would want to occupy South Lebanon again, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=55.92s)]
*  because this time the resistance is stronger than it was in the past. So I really don't understand [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=63.2s)]
*  the Israelis, because if they want to get back their people to the north, those who were displaced [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=70.4s)]
*  to the north, to their villages and settlements, they have to negotiate. And they have to negotiate [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=78.72s)]
*  with the Lebanese government through mediators like the Americans as well. So have there been [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=85.44s)]
*  any negotiations, before I get to the nitty-gritty of the exploding walkie-talkies, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=92.32s)]
*  has there been any kind of diplomatic attempt? Because Hezbollah obviously also got into this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=98.24s)]
*  war after October 7th in support of Hamas. So there's been an ongoing exchange of fire [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=104.08s)]
*  between the two sides for nearly a year now. That's true. Till October 8th it would be a year. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=111.28s)]
*  So yes, the Americans got involved, the French got involved, UN tries its best as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=119.2s)]
*  But we depend on the Americans now to really take them. Mr. Amos Hoekstein is, or I don't know if he [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=128.96s)]
*  still is in Israel. And I think he was supposed to come here if he has any message. It seems he [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=137.04s)]
*  doesn't have any message. He has been negotiating, he has been talking to people here and in Israel, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=144.4s)]
*  but so far nothing came out. So Foreign Minister, the Americans say they were not told of these [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=150.8s)]
*  details. Now the Israelis are saying they did warn the Americans, but apparently by consensus [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=156.4s)]
*  there was no details given to the Americans, neither to Mr. Hoekstein nor to the State Department. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=161.84s)]
*  And the Secretary of State is in the region right now. This is what he's saying about the general [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=168.08s)]
*  situation. We've been very clear and we remain very clear about the importance of all parties [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=174.16s)]
*  avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're trying to resolve [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=181.76000000000002s)]
*  in Gaza to see it spread to other fronts. It's clearly not in the interest of anyone involved [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=188.16s)]
*  to see that happen and that's why again it's imperative that all parties refrain from any [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=193.12s)]
*  actions that could escalate the conflict. Foreign Minister, he's talking about trying to get a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  ceasefire in Gaza in order to calm the whole area. A, do you think that's what it's going to take to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=204.08s)]
*  stop Hezbollah from its activities? Look, Hezbollah is a resistance movement and let's deal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=210.08s)]
*  government to government. We are willing to talk to Hezbollah in the right time and we communicate [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=217.68s)]
*  with them all the time and I think if Israel wants peace we are ready for peace, for a ceasefire, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  not a peace treaty but for a ceasefire on the border and an agreement on what are the conditions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=230.96s)]
*  for this ceasefire. Granted that 1701 which is United Nations Security Council resolution 1701 [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=237.12s)]
*  is a very important resolution for us and if we implemented for us and the Israelis and we both [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=244.96s)]
*  said that's implemented but Israel violates Lebanon, the sovereignty of Lebanon every day. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=251.84s)]
*  Every day there is a violation so I'm not defending Hezbollah because yes they are also [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=257.52s)]
*  you know retaliating. Escalation has been all the time Israelis like what happened yesterday, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=265.35999999999996s)]
*  what happened today is escalation. We cannot talk to Hezbollah anymore now in the way we were talking [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=271.52s)]
*  to them in the past because they are of course they were hit very badly and therefore retaliation [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  is a must to them. We'll try to do something but I don't know how much we have power to stop them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRFaUBRAEoA&t=285.2s)]
