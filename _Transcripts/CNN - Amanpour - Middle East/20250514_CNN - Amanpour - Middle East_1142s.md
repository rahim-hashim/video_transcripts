Video Description: President Trump's trip to the Middle East this week does not include a stop in Israel, raising the question of whether there might be a growing divide between the two allies. Veteran New York Times foreign affairs Opinion columnist Thomas Friedman says the alliance is unsurprisingly frayed, given this Israeli government's approach to the war against Hamas. He joins Michel Martin to discuss his most recent op-ed on the topic.

*  And you say that Israel has a [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=51.84s)]
*  government that is no longer [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=54.74s)]

*  And you write this this recent [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=58.08s)]
*  column was written as an open [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=59.64s)]
*  letter to President Trump. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=60.94s)]

*  He's going to the UAE. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=64.74s)]
*  He is bypassing Israel on this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=66.08s)]
*  trip. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=67.64s)]
*  And one of the things that you [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=68.24s)]
*  say is that the fact that you're [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=69.18s)]
*  traveling there next week, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=72.38s)]
*  meeting the leaders of Saudi [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=73.48s)]
*  Arabia, the United Arab Emirates [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=74.54s)]
*  and Qatar, and that you have no [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=75.98s)]
*  plans to see Prime Minister [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=77.18s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=78.44s)]
*  suggests to me that you are [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=80.28s)]
*  starting to understand a vital [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=81.38s)]
*  truth that this Israeli [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=83.04s)]
*  government is behaving in ways [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=84.82s)]
*  that threaten hardcore U.S. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=86.64s)]
*  interests in the region. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=88.62s)]
*  Netanyahu is not our friend. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  And that you go on to say that I [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  have no doubt that generally [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=93.9s)]
*  speaking, the Israeli people [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=95.26s)]
*  continue to see themselves as [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=96.56s)]
*  steadfast allies of the American [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  people and vice versa. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  But this ultra nationalist [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=101.22s)]
*  messianic Israeli government is [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=103.06s)]
*  not America's ally. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=104.9s)]
*  These are some very strong [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  words. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=108.2s)]
*  What what prompted you to write [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=108.86000000000001s)]
*  them? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=111.22s)]
*  Well, Michelle, first of all, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  this is a theme really I've been [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=113.4s)]
*  on since this government came to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=114.7s)]
*  power because this is the first [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=116.16s)]
*  Israeli government that has not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=117.86s)]
*  made its priority a peace with [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=119.94s)]
*  the surrounding Arab states [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=122.6s)]
*  expanding the circle of peace [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=123.76s)]
*  with the surrounding Arab states [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=125.1s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=126.34s)]
*  Its number one priority has been [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=127.36s)]
*  foreign policy terms has been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=129.3s)]
*  annexation of the West Bank. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=130.84s)]
*  It's part of actually the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=132.34s)]
*  formation document of this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=134.3s)]
*  coalition. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=136.3s)]
*  So that in itself is a threat to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=137.44s)]
*  U.S. interests, Michelle, in [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=140.3s)]
*  this way. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=141.4s)]
*  Basically, since Henry [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=142.2s)]
*  Kissinger and Richard Nixon [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=143.6s)]
*  after the 1973 war engineered [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=145.7s)]
*  the eviction of the Russians from [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  the Middle East laid the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=149.73999999999998s)]
*  groundwork for the Camp David [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=151.1s)]
*  Peace Treaty, which was the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=152.5s)]
*  groundwork for the Oslo Peace [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=153.64s)]
*  Treaty, which was the really the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=155.0s)]
*  groundwork for the peace process [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  of every American [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=158.5s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=159.2s)]
*  The U.S. has basically set up a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=160.5s)]
*  regional order of pro-U.S. Arab [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=162.38s)]
*  governments and Israel that has [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=165.33999999999997s)]
*  served our interests quite well, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=167.04s)]
*  served the economic interests of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=168.44s)]

*  parties as well. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=170.67999999999998s)]
*  And Israel's efforts, this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=171.94s)]
*  government's attempt to basically [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=173.7s)]
*  drive Palestinians out of the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=175.44s)]

*  pursuit of a goal of annexation [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=179.12s)]
*  threatens not only to upset that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=181.12s)]
*  whole order, but also to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=182.54s)]
*  destabilize two pillars of that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=184.72s)]
*  order, Israel's neighbors, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=186.74s)]
*  Jordan and Egypt, because they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=188.24s)]
*  both fear Israel wants to drive [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=190.38s)]

*  That is in fundamental [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=195.52s)]
*  contradiction to U.S. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=196.52s)]

*  What do you think is driving [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=198.92s)]
*  this? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=200.18s)]
*  Well, this is the most right-wing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=201.18s)]
*  messianic government Israel's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=204.88s)]
*  ever had. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=206.96s)]
*  When this government was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  announced, I should recall for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  you, back in late 2022, I [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=212.88s)]
*  actually wrote a column. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=216.56s)]
*  The first column I wrote the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=217.42s)]
*  morning after was announced, was [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=218.38s)]
*  that the Israel you knew is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  over. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=221.12s)]
*  Because the members of this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=222.68s)]

*  Netanyahu that he wasn't going [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=296.14s)]

*  What is it that you think they [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=298.4s)]
*  didn't see that you saw? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=299.28s)]
*  Well, you know, President Biden, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=300.94s)]
*  God bless him, you know, used to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=302.74s)]
*  say about Bibi that he would say [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=303.9s)]
*  to Bibi, Bibi, I love you, but I [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=305.78s)]
*  disagree with you, you know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=308.24s)]
*  And I think he really [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=310.14s)]
*  underestimated how much [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=311.4s)]
*  Netanyahu himself had changed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  And he had changed, Michelle, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=315.34s)]
*  ever since he was indicted on [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=317.58s)]
*  three different counts of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=320.24s)]
*  different forms of corruption [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=321.68s)]
*  and malfeasance and faced [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=323.0s)]
*  the prospect of going to jail. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=325.53999999999996s)]
*  And Israel has put a president [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=327.74s)]
*  in jail and put a prime minister [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=329.84s)]
*  in jail. It puts people in jail, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=331.38s)]
*  unlike some other countries I [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=333.74s)]
*  know, and it put leaders in jail. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=334.84s)]
*  And this was a very real [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=338.0s)]
*  prospect for Netanyahu. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=339.88s)]
*  Therefore, he had to be in [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=341.24s)]
*  government. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=343.08s)]
*  And basically that created a huge [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=343.84s)]
*  vulnerability for him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=345.94s)]
*  The only way he could get a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=346.98s)]
*  cabinet coalition to rule was by [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=348.34s)]
*  bringing into Israeli politics, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=350.94s)]
*  into the very center of Israeli [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=352.64s)]
*  politics, people who had never [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=354.11999999999995s)]
*  had these positions of authority [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  before from the national [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  religious faction and from the [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=359.58s)]
*  far right ultra messianic [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=361.17999999999995s)]
*  nationalist faction. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=363.47999999999996s)]
*  And he had to bring them in. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=364.78s)]
*  And once they were in, they [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=366.28s)]
*  basically had him over a barrel [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=367.78s)]
*  because any time he didn't follow [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=369.84s)]
*  their dictates, they would [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=371.28s)]
*  threaten to topple him and expose [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=372.62s)]
*  him to the prospect of going to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  jail. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=375.73999999999995s)]
*  So Netanyahu has never been a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  straight shooter in this from the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=378.18s)]
*  very beginning. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=379.22s)]
*  He wakes up every morning and [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=380.12s)]
*  thinks about his interests and he [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=381.22s)]
*  thinks about the national [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=382.68s)]
*  interests. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=383.88s)]
*  And some days the former wins and [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=384.46s)]
*  some days the latter wins. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=386.26s)]
*  Now, I understand that you say [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=387.68s)]
*  that you say that he's put his [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=388.82s)]
*  personal interests ahead of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=389.86s)]
*  Israel's, but is it possible that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=391.02s)]
*  he just thinks he's right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=392.68s)]
*  Is it possible that he just [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=394.38s)]
*  think that this really is the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=395.52s)]
*  brutality of this campaign in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=396.86s)]
*  Gaza, these aggressive efforts in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=398.86s)]
*  the West Bank that are just what [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=401.62s)]
*  it takes to secure Israel? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=403.88s)]
*  Is it possible he just thinks [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=405.36s)]
*  he's correct? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=406.48s)]
*  That's a very good question. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=407.86s)]
*  I opposed the Israeli invasion [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=408.90000000000003s)]
*  from the very beginning. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=410.2s)]
*  I thought it was a mistake. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=410.94s)]
*  I thought they should make this [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=412.6s)]
*  Operation Rescue Grandma focus [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  entirely on the hostages and use [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=415.3s)]
*  the kind of very surgical tactics [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=417.56s)]
*  they used after the Munich [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=419.06s)]
*  massacre, not make it Dresden. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=420.1s)]
*  But when Israel decided, no, no, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=422.24s)]
*  we're going to go in, we're going [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=423.5s)]
*  to invade, I said, if you're going [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=424.34000000000003s)]
*  to do this, therefore the only [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=425.44s)]
*  way to do this that would give you [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=427.1s)]
*  time and legitimacy and the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=428.44s)]
*  resources you need is if you have [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  a Palestinian partner, if you make [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=432.04s)]
*  clear that you're going into Gaza, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=434.04s)]
*  not just to wipe out Hamas and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=435.44s)]
*  then leave a barren wasteland, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=437.44s)]
*  not just to go into Gaza to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=439.08s)]
*  resettle it, but to replace Hamas [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=441.82s)]
*  with a decent Palestinian [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=444.42s)]
*  authority that might one day be a [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=445.74s)]
*  partner for peace. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=447.62s)]
*  That is the Palestinian authority [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=448.78s)]
*  in the West Bank led by President [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=450.08s)]
*  Mahmoud Abbas that has embraced [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=452.34s)]
*  the Oslo Peace Accords. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=453.92s)]
*  Bibi did none of that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=455.24s)]
*  One of the people don't realize [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=456.64s)]
*  how insane this war has been. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=458.18s)]
*  This was a war that was launched [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=460.34s)]
*  with absolutely no plan for the [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=462.14s)]
*  morning after. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=463.74s)]
*  And the reason there was no plan [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=464.72s)]
*  for the morning after is Netanyahu [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=466.24s)]
*  knew if he ever said he would [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=467.88s)]
*  partner with the P.A., the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=469.38s)]
*  right wingers would bring down his [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=471.04s)]
*  government. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=472.72s)]
*  So it's fought this war now for [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=473.52s)]
*  over a year and a half with no [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=475.22s)]
*  exit strategy. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=477.54s)]
*  So what did they do? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=478.82s)]
*  They went in, they destroyed a lot [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=479.72s)]
*  of houses, they killed a lot of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=481.82s)]
*  people, they killed a lot of Hamas [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=483.38s)]
*  people, and then they went out. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=485.04s)]
*  Then they reappeared. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=486.68s)]
*  They went in, destroyed more [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=487.68s)]
*  houses, killed more Palestinians, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=488.68s)]
*  killed more Hamas people and then [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  went out. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=492.08s)]
*  And then finally we had this [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=492.92s)]
*  ceasefire agreement. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=494.38s)]
*  And then that led to the first [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=495.88s)]
*  hostage exchange. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=498.36s)]
*  And then Bibi said, no, we're [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=499.92s)]
*  going to resume the war. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  We're going to go in. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=502.06s)]
*  And now the plan is to go in and [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=502.96s)]
*  stay in and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=505.48s)]
*  end the war once and for all. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  Michelle, I will tell you as a [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=510.82s)]
*  veteran of this story, the four [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=511.98s)]
*  most dangerous words in the [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=513.36s)]
*  Middle East are once and for all. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=514.46s)]
*  OK, remember, Michelle, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=517.22s)]
*  Israel has been in the West Bank [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=519.92s)]
*  for 58 years. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=521.48s)]
*  It still doesn't control the West [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=523.76s)]
*  Bank entirely. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=525.82s)]
*  So imagine they're going to do [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=526.82s)]
*  that in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=527.86s)]
*  You're talking about seven [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=529.36s)]
*  million Jews trying to control [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=530.22s)]
*  over seven million Palestinians. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=531.9200000000001s)]
*  The Israeli government has as [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=534.12s)]
*  much to lose as anyone. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=535.2600000000001s)]
*  Why is there not more of a [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  movement to counteract this [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=538.86s)]
*  this ultra-nationalist [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=541.82s)]
*  messianic movement as you [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=543.36s)]
*  describe it? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=545.12s)]
*  The answer, basically, Michelle, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  goes to Hamas's responsibility [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  for this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, one of my proudest [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=550.96s)]

*  2002. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=553.62s)]
*  I interviewed the Saudi [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  Crown Prince Abdullah, who in [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=555.46s)]
*  the interview with me outlined [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=557.86s)]
*  the Saudi peace plan. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=559.14s)]
*  It later became the Arab Peace [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=560.5s)]
*  Initiative, calling for a two [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=562.14s)]
*  state solution between Israel [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=563.26s)]
*  and all the Arab states based [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=564.86s)]
*  on a Palestinian state in the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=566.6s)]
*  West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=567.74s)]
*  It was an amazing initiative. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=571.4000000000001s)]
*  The interview is one of the most [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=574.6600000000001s)]
*  important things I've ever done. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=576.36s)]
*  It was actually adopted by the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=577.6s)]
*  Arab League in March. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=579.0s)]
*  I did the interview in February [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=580.86s)]
*  and March in Beirut. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  They had an Arab League summit. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=583.1s)]
*  You know what happened on the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  first night of that summit, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=584.96s)]
*  Michelle? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=585.9000000000001s)]
*  On the first night of that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=586.6s)]
*  summit happened to coincide with [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=587.36s)]
*  the first night of Passover. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=588.6600000000001s)]
*  And a Hamas suicide bomber walked [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=590.74s)]
*  into a hotel Passover Seder in a [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=592.94s)]
*  hotel in Netanya and blew himself [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  up with a suicide vest, killing, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=597.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't remember how many people, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=599.96s)]
*  but wounding scores. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=601.2s)]
*  That was Hamas's answer to the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=602.9000000000001s)]
*  first Arab Peace Initiative. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=604.76s)]
*  So I have no absolute sympathy [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=606.5400000000001s)]
*  for these people. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=608.5600000000001s)]
*  These are terrible people. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=609.2s)]
*  This is a terrible organization. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=610.64s)]
*  And for those students on campus [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=612.3000000000001s)]
*  who on the morning after October [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=614.1999999999999s)]
*  7th, you know, put up signs of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=615.9s)]

*  you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=620.0s)]
*  These are people who have helped [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=620.54s)]
*  destroy the Palestinian future [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=622.14s)]
*  more than anybody. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=623.9599999999999s)]
*  I have no illusions about that at [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=624.9s)]
*  all. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=626.9599999999999s)]
*  But I'm saying to Israel, if [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=627.56s)]
*  that's who you've got out there, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=629.16s)]
*  then you've got two options. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=630.6s)]
*  You've got permanent war against [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=632.5s)]
*  them or you try, try and try [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=633.9s)]
*  again to nurture an alternative. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=636.06s)]
*  There is an alternative there. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=638.54s)]
*  It's weak and frail. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=639.6999999999999s)]
*  It's the Palestinian authority. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=640.66s)]
*  It's been corrupt. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=642.4599999999999s)]
*  It's got all kinds of problems. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=643.24s)]
*  But I'm telling you, nurturing [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=645.14s)]
*  that alternative rather than a [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=646.88s)]
*  forever war in a tick tock world [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=648.14s)]
*  will be much better, I believe, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=650.6800000000001s)]
*  for the future of the Jewish [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=652.6800000000001s)]
*  people and for Palestinians. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=653.58s)]
*  So last week, Reuters reported [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=655.08s)]
*  that the U.S. is no longer [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=656.48s)]
*  demanding that Saudi Arabia [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=657.6800000000001s)]
*  normalize ties with Israel as a [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=659.72s)]
*  condition to further their civil [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=661.92s)]
*  nuclear cooperation talks. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=664.32s)]
*  And, you know, as I think many [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=666.08s)]
*  people may remember, the Biden [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=668.38s)]
*  administration had made [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=669.54s)]
*  normalization a key part of a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=670.98s)]
*  broader deal. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=672.94s)]
*  And the fact that the Trump [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=674.08s)]
*  administration is clearly what [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=675.1400000000001s)]
*  seems to be walking away from [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=676.48s)]
*  that, what does that say to you? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=678.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, it says they got fed up [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=680.2800000000001s)]
*  with Netanyahu, basically, you [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=681.3800000000001s)]
*  know, Netanyahu for a year tried [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=682.74s)]
*  to come up with some formulation [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=684.74s)]
*  to satisfy the Saudis. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=686.08s)]
*  The Saudis said, we will agree [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=687.22s)]
*  to normalize relations with [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=689.58s)]
*  Israel, which would then help [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=690.7800000000001s)]
*  pave the way in Congress for a [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=691.7800000000001s)]
*  big U.S.-Saudi security treaty, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=693.62s)]
*  including a civil nuclear [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=696.2800000000001s)]
*  program. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=697.34s)]
*  We will agree to do that if [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=698.08s)]
*  Israel agrees to open [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=699.2800000000001s)]
*  negotiations on a clear pathway [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=701.04s)]
*  to a Palestinian state. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=703.54s)]
*  So for a year, Netanyahu played [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=704.98s)]
*  around with all kinds of [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=706.98s)]
*  language, whatnot, that would [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=707.88s)]
*  somehow thread the needle so he [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=709.38s)]
*  could say that and not blow up [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  his cabinet. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  The Saudis never bought it. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=712.8199999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration never [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=713.9399999999999s)]
*  bought it. And Trump never [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=715.42s)]
*  bought it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=716.48s)]
*  And Trump basically got fed up [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=716.98s)]

*  We're just going to do this deal [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=720.28s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and I'll get [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=721.28s)]
*  it through Congress. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=722.8399999999999s)]

*  you normalizing with Israel. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=725.04s)]
*  Think of what Netanyahu [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=726.64s)]
*  sacrificed, Michel. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=728.12s)]
*  He basically traded the peace [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=729.42s)]
*  with Smotrich, the far right [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=731.78s)]

*  important Muslim nation, not the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=738.86s)]
*  biggest, but the most important, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=740.16s)]
*  most influential, the home of [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=741.52s)]
*  the two holy sites of Mecca and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=743.18s)]

*  Peace between Israel and Saudi [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=747.58s)]
*  Arabia would not only have [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=748.86s)]

*  Israel, it also would have [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=756.72s)]
*  diffused tensions between Jews [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=758.56s)]
*  and Muslims that have been there [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=760.5s)]

*  birth of Zionism. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=766.0s)]

*  huge change. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=769.0999999999999s)]

*  his political interests, peace [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=772.4399999999999s)]

*  Again, your column was written [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=777.3399999999999s)]
*  as sort of an open letter to [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=778.6999999999999s)]
*  President Trump. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=780.0999999999999s)]
*  You wrote that on the Middle [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=781.14s)]
*  East, you have some good [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=782.3599999999999s)]
*  independent instincts. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=783.3599999999999s)]
*  Does he really? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=785.8399999999999s)]
*  Or is it more that he tends to [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=786.8s)]
*  position his foreign policy in [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=789.04s)]
*  opposition to whatever the Biden [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=790.5s)]
*  administration did? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=792.2s)]
*  Because if that's the case, then [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=794.1s)]
*  that really isn't a strategy. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=795.34s)]
*  It's a reaction. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=796.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, basically, you know, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=799.4399999999999s)]
*  dealing with Trump's instincts [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=802.6s)]
*  and whatnot is a perilous [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=803.96s)]
*  adventure, you know, but what I [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=805.36s)]
*  was trying to suggest is that his [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=807.06s)]
*  willingness to negotiate [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=808.8s)]
*  directly with Hamas, for the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=810.64s)]
*  release of an American hostage [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=812.46s)]
*  and not hostage America to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=814.16s)]
*  Bibi Netanyahu's interest in his [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=816.4s)]
*  refusal to negotiate, I thought [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=818.1999999999999s)]
*  was a good thing. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=820.1s)]
*  It's shaken up Israeli politics, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=820.78s)]
*  which is in turmoil today [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=822.48s)]
*  because of that. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=823.6999999999999s)]
*  His willingness to do a deal [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=824.64s)]
*  with the Houthis without, again, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=826.0s)]
*  hostageing himself to Netanyahu, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=827.64s)]
*  that was probably one could make [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=829.84s)]
*  a good argument for that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=831.4s)]
*  His willingness to negotiate [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=832.84s)]
*  with Iran rather than just giving [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=834.0s)]
*  Israel long range bombers. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=835.8s)]
*  Well, you know, we'll have to see. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=837.4399999999999s)]
*  It depends what the deal looks [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=838.74s)]
*  like. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=840.1s)]
*  But he is not. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=840.6999999999999s)]
*  Biden was in this situation, in [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=842.6s)]
*  fairness to Biden, where had he [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=844.04s)]
*  tried any of these things, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=845.9s)]
*  Netanyahu would have gone to [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=847.0799999999999s)]
*  Republican members of Congress [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=848.0s)]
*  and they and Trump would have [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=849.8s)]
*  blocked everything Biden tried to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=850.88s)]
*  do. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=852.14s)]
*  So Trump is just taking advantage [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=852.98s)]
*  of the fact that he's not Biden, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=855.24s)]
*  that the Republicans are [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=856.64s)]
*  basically a Trump cult who will do [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=858.6s)]
*  whatever he tells them to do. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=860.54s)]
*  So he doesn't have to worry about [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=861.9399999999999s)]
*  being outflanked on his right [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=863.64s)]
*  by Republicans or evangelicals. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=865.5s)]
*  And this has given him much more [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=867.64s)]
*  freedom of action. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=869.3s)]
*  How it'll all add up? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=870.6999999999999s)]
*  Let's wait and see. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=872.04s)]
*  Well, we see that as you and I [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=873.14s)]
*  are speaking now, the president's [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=875.48s)]
*  still in the region. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=876.62s)]
*  He as we are speaking, he landed [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=877.48s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia, had this lavish [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=879.58s)]
*  welcome ceremony and is touting [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  his ability to make deals. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=884.52s)]
*  A lot of these are arms deals. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=886.16s)]
*  And also, also it is it is [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=888.88s)]
*  asserted that there will be [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=891.4200000000001s)]
*  investment deals from the Gulf [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=892.78s)]
*  States in the United States. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=895.32s)]
*  So how do you how do you read [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=897.86s)]
*  that? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=900.22s)]
*  Well, you know, Trump is all [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=900.76s)]
*  about he's a transactional person [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=901.98s)]
*  and he thinks life is about [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=904.22s)]
*  leverage and leverage comes from [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=906.3000000000001s)]
*  having more money than the other [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=907.9s)]
*  guy, which then gives you more [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=909.12s)]
*  leverage to get more money. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=910.7s)]
*  So, you know, I'm all for trade [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=913.0s)]
*  deals. I'm I'm disappointed that [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=915.32s)]
*  it has to be all weapons systems. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=917.76s)]
*  But that's Trump. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=920.82s)]
*  I mean, I and let's see how many [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=922.0s)]
*  of these we've heard these things [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=923.76s)]
*  before, how many of them actually [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=925.0s)]
*  come through. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=927.6600000000001s)]
*  know, presidents are not judged [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=929.02s)]
*  by how big of arms sales they make [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=931.22s)]
*  to the Middle East. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=933.26s)]
*  They're judged by their ability [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=934.2s)]
*  to advance the peace process [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=935.5s)]
*  there. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=936.76s)]
*  And when it comes to Trump, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=937.3s)]
*  that is still TBD. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=939.96s)]
*  What I what I was trying to say [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=941.5s)]
*  in my column is his willingness [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=942.9399999999999s)]
*  to think unconventionally, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=944.36s)]
*  you know, is I think can be a [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=947.5s)]
*  real asset here. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=948.74s)]
*  But I'm not sure he has the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=949.9399999999999s)]
*  patience, the interest or the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=951.4399999999999s)]

*  the hard spade work of the [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=955.46s)]
*  morning after to actually create [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=956.9s)]
*  a different reality in the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=959.34s)]

*  Before you let you go, you [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=961.1s)]
*  you've ended your column by [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=962.9s)]
*  quoting an editorial in in [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=964.64s)]

*  the target was a Hamas [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=978.24s)]

*  Palestinians in the strip who [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=987.78s)]

*  None of this will change the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1001.28s)]
*  bitter fact Israel killed them. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1002.7s)]

*  We must not avert our eyes. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1006.64s)]
*  We must wake up and cry out [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1008.48s)]
*  loudly. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1009.98s)]
*  Stop the war. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1010.84s)]
*  I just wanted to hear more [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1011.84s)]
*  about whether you think that [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1012.84s)]
*  something is changing in Israel. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1014.64s)]
*  But the tolerance for this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1016.2s)]
*  Is diminishing. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1019.24s)]
*  Yeah, there's no question, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1020.6s)]
*  Michelle, that the sort of [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1021.34s)]
*  solidarity that was apparent in [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1022.72s)]
*  Israel for the first year of the [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1025.6200000000001s)]
*  war has fractured. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1026.8400000000001s)]
*  You have reservists who are [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1028.04s)]
*  refusing to report for duty now [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1029.42s)]
*  because there is there is a [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1032.04s)]
*  feeling that all the army is [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1033.08s)]
*  doing now is going after second [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1035.58s)]
*  and tertiary targets or leaders [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1037.1200000000001s)]
*  and just killing a lot of [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1039.74s)]
*  people. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1040.54s)]
*  And I think as much as that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1041.48s)]
*  hadn't got through early on, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1044.28s)]
*  it has gotten through to at [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1046.58s)]
*  least part of the Israeli [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1048.42s)]
*  population, enough of it that [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1049.42s)]
*  people are based. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1051.24s)]
*  I would say the majority in [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1052.44s)]
*  Israel now, their view is stop [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1053.72s)]
*  the war, give us our hostages [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1055.6200000000001s)]
*  back. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1057.54s)]
*  And if Hamas wants to run the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1058.14s)]
*  place, let them run it. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1059.34s)]
*  OK, and you have an Israeli [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1060.74s)]
*  cabinet basically in opposition [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1062.42s)]
*  that that nice as we're going to [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1064.38s)]
*  restart the war, we're actually [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1066.04s)]
*  going to restart in a way where [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1067.74s)]
*  we heard all the Palestinians [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1068.74s)]
*  into about 25 percent quadrant [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1070.34s)]
*  of Gaza Strip and we are going [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1072.32s)]
*  to permanently occupy the place. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1074.94s)]
*  So the government now is [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1076.34s)]
*  completely at odds with the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1077.34s)]
*  Israeli majority right now. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1079.42s)]
*  And you can see that tension [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  every day. You pick up the [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1083.16s)]
*  Israeli papers. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  These are all people have been [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1085.3600000000001s)]
*  too long at war. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1086.22s)]
*  There hasn't also been a huge [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1087.38s)]
*  outcry in the Arab Muslim world [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1089.18s)]
*  about the Jewish casualties in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1091.5800000000002s)]
*  the first week. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1093.42s)]
*  So, you know, my view is these [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1094.3600000000001s)]
*  are people who have just done [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1096.96s)]
*  awful things to each other for [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1098.5800000000002s)]
*  for way too long. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1100.8600000000001s)]
*  And my own philosophy in [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1102.3200000000002s)]
*  approaching this war is I'm not [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1104.88s)]
*  here to keep score. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1106.72s)]
*  Who's awful? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1107.66s)]
*  I've been doing this for 50 [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1108.52s)]
*  years. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1109.52s)]
*  I'm here to figure out a way out [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1110.1200000000001s)]
*  and all my thinking is devoted [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1111.78s)]
*  to figuring out how we stop this, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1114.22s)]
*  how we get back to two states [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1116.42s)]
*  for two people. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1117.82s)]
*  And that's what that's what's [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1118.8600000000001s)]
*  motivating me from the start [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1121.22s)]
*  and today. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR1aAcnIsLY&t=1122.82s)]
