Some 100 hostages are still believed to be held inside Gaza today. Aviva Siegel was among those released as part of the deal last November, but her husband Keith, an American-Israeli citizen, remains in captivity. Aviva Siegel joins the show from Israel.

# Former Israeli Hostage on Her Release and Her Husband's Ongoing Captivity  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs)
*  It's been one year since the only deal between Israel and Hamas led to the release of over [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=0.0s)]
*  100 captives taken on October 7th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=5.92s)]
*  Around 100 hostages are still believed to be held inside Gaza to this day. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=9.48s)]
*  Aviva Siegel was released as part of that original deal last November, but her husband [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=14.8s)]
*  Keith, an American Israeli citizen, remains in captivity. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=20.0s)]
*  And she's joining us now from Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=24.88s)]
*  Aviva Siegel, welcome to the program. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=27.2s)]
*  And I just want to know what you're thinking today regarding the fact that you and about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=30.44s)]
*  100 others were released exactly a year ago. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=37.04s)]
*  What do you think about that deal that enabled that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=40.44s)]
*  Hello, everybody, and thank you for having me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=46.44s)]
*  I am lucky to be sitting here and that everybody can see me alive because I nearly died in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=56.32s)]
*  The only way to get the hostages out is to bring them back with a deal. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=57.56s)]
*  And we know that after so many months and so many days have passed while Keith, my husband, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=62.32s)]
*  that's an American citizen, is underneath the ground, 40 meters underneath the ground, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=70.28s)]
*  and just praying that somebody will come and take him out and bring him home. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=76.08s)]
*  I cannot wait for that to happen. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=81.72s)]
*  Aviva, do you know that he's under the ground? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=84.72s)]
*  Have you had word from others? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=87.92s)]
*  Were you kept underground? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=89.72s)]
*  What was your situation and what do you think your husband is going through? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=92.24s)]
*  Yes, I was twice underneath the ground. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=100.08s)]
*  And I want to tell everybody that it's worse than hell. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=102.92s)]
*  It's the worst thing that anybody can go through in this world. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=107.56s)]
*  We were just thrown underneath the ground, 40 meters, and we were left there alone. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  I remember there were two terrorists that were with us and they were talking. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=117.4s)]
*  And then suddenly it was silence. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=121.28s)]
*  And I looked at Keith and I said, Keith, do you think they left us here alone underneath [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  the ground? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=130.0s)]
*  It was dark. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=131.28s)]
*  We could hardly see anything. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  And we did not have any oxygen to breathe. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  We got to a state that I looked at Keith and saw that he could hardly breathe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=137.6s)]
*  And he said that he feels that he can't breathe. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=144.48s)]
*  And I want to tell you that I told Keith, just lie down and try and breathe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=148.04s)]
*  And that's what we did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=154.12s)]
*  We just lay down with no, not able to even talk, to pick ourselves up, even to sit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=155.24s)]
*  We had to lie down and try and breathe while I was thinking in my head, who's going to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=164.16s)]
*  die first, Keith or I? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  And I just prayed that I would die first because it was very difficult for me to see Keith. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=173.0s)]
*  I could not even watch him and watch his chest going up and down and up and down. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=178.52s)]
*  Well, I felt the same. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=186.24s)]
*  I just want to do die. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=188.08s)]
*  Have you had any word about him from any of the other hostages or anybody? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=191.56s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=197.28s)]
*  The only thing that we do know is that Keith, they released the Hamas Terrest released a [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=200.56s)]
*  video of Keith in April. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=205.56s)]
*  And that's more than a half a year ago. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  Keith looks pale. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=210.44s)]
*  He looks old. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=212.08s)]
*  He looks tired. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=213.08s)]
*  He's begging and he's crying to get out of it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=214.08s)]
*  He's 65 years old. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=217.76s)]
*  He was taken from his house with Hamas terrorists in his pajamas and he's still there underneath [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=219.88s)]
*  the ground. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  We've been told that the hostages are underneath the ground, just where I was and I nearly [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  died. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=233.56s)]
*  Can I ask you Aviva, since your release, you've been part of a hostage family advocate group. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=234.56s)]
*  You want them back. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=241.28s)]
*  And this week, hostage families gathered to mark the anniversary of that one deal that [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=242.28s)]
*  enabled your release and that of others. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=246.88000000000002s)]
*  The theme of the gathering was a year is too long for a deal. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=250.36s)]
*  So why do you think there hasn't been another deal and there haven't been hostages released [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=255.08s)]
*  in that fashion? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=260.42s)]
*  Well, I don't know why it's taking so long. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=262.92s)]
*  I just do know that Keith is not sitting in front of me and I'm waiting for him to come [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=268.2s)]
*  back and I just want him to come back alive. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=273.76s)]
*  I want him to come back strong. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=277.24s)]
*  And I am just so scared of what kind of Keith we're going to get back, how thin he's going [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=280.04s)]
*  to be, what is he going to look like if he's going to be so ill that we'll just have to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=285.76s)]
*  take care of him for the rest of his life because it's dangerous there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=290.4s)]
*  The Hamas terrorists did not treat us like people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=295.24s)]
*  They did everything they wanted to make us feel that we're not even human beings. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=299.04s)]
*  We were taken all human rights away. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=304.92s)]
*  We weren't allowed to talk. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=308.32s)]
*  We weren't allowed to hug. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=310.04s)]
*  We weren't allowed to feel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=311.04s)]
*  We weren't allowed to stand or move our bodies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=312.04s)]
*  And you know, Keith, while he was taken, he was pushed by the Hamas terrorists and they [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=316.16s)]
*  broke his ribs and they shot him on his hand. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=321.12s)]
*  And he used to beg them to lie down sometimes during the day just to relax his pain. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=325.24s)]
*  And they said no. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=332.15999999999997s)]
*  They used to eat in front of us while they starved us. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=333.64s)]
*  And they used to drink water while they did not bring us any water to drink. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2ZfCrhSTs&t=338.86s)]
