Video Description: As tension and division mount in much of the world, university campuses in the United States have become a focal point of anger and dissent -- from the Ivy League to public schools and colleges. Stanford University reports that five recent incidents on the campus are under investigation as potential hate crimes. But two Dartmouth professors -- Susannah Heschel, chair of Jewish studies, and Tarek El-Ariss, chair of Middle Eastern studies -- set out to create a forum for students to discuss their thoughts. Michel Martin speaks to both professors about this response and what it achieved.

*  Thanks, Christiane. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=40.0s)]
*  Professor Al-Dariz, Professor Heschel, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=42.0s)]
*  thank you both so much for joining us today. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=44.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=46.0s)]
*  As we are speaking, we are about [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=48.0s)]
*  a month after these terrible [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=50.0s)]
*  events that have consumed so much [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=52.0s)]
*  of our attention, this terrible [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=54.0s)]
*  event, by Hamas and Southern Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=56.0s)]
*  If I could just ask you briefly [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=58.0s)]
*  to take me back to that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=60.0s)]
*  moment. Professor Al-Dariz, do you remember how [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=62.0s)]
*  you found out what had happened and what [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=64.0s)]
*  went through your mind? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=66.0s)]
*  I was in Cairo when this [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=68.0s)]
*  happened and I was following [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=70.0s)]
*  as the events unfold on the Arabic [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=72.0s)]
*  channels and so on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=74.0s)]
*  And I, you know, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=76.0s)]
*  I'm originally from Lebanon [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=78.0s)]
*  but I also lived in New York on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=80.0s)]
*  9-11. I mean, it was one of those [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=82.0s)]
*  moments where I felt this is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=84.0s)]
*  really horrible, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=86.0s)]
*  horrible event. I immediately got [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=88.0s)]
*  on the phone with, you know, with [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=90.0s)]
*  Professor Heschel and we said this [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=92.0s)]
*  is really, this is not just [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=94.0s)]
*  any other attack or, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=96.0s)]
*  you know, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=98.0s)]
*  another episode that we see [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=100.0s)]
*  a lot of. This is something that is going [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=102.0s)]
*  to open [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=104.0s)]
*  a portal into a form [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=106.0s)]
*  of violence that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=108.0s)]
*  we haven't seen [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=110.0s)]
*  like this. And immediately we talked and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=112.0s)]
*  said, okay, we need to create a forum [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=114.0s)]
*  for this. We need to create a space [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=116.0s)]
*  where people can come and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=118.0s)]
*  talk about this and engage [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=120.0s)]
*  with this and think about this. This is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=122.0s)]
*  going to, you know, capture [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=124.0s)]
*  people's minds. I mean, this is going to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=126.0s)]
*  really make people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=128.0s)]
*  want to, it's going to consume people, not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=130.0s)]
*  only in the Middle East but also obviously, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=132.0s)]
*  you know, in the US as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=134.0s)]
*  And whatever there are diasporas [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=136.0s)]
*  identifying with [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=138.0s)]
*  that part of the world in some way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=140.0s)]
*  It sounds as though for both of you, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=142.0s)]
*  your immediate instinct is we have to create [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=144.0s)]
*  a forum to talk about this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=146.0s)]
*  Professor Heschel, talk to me about [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=148.0s)]
*  that because, look, it has to be said [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=150.0s)]
*  that was not every scholar's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=152.0s)]
*  first instinct. I mean, some scholars were, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=154.0s)]
*  you know, organizing [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=156.0s)]
*  rallies. Some scholars were, you know, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=158.0s)]
*  say more if you would about the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=160.0s)]
*  conversation that you and Professor Alariz [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=162.0s)]
*  had. I was [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=164.0s)]
*  extremely upset, as you could imagine. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=166.0s)]
*  But I have a professional obligation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=168.0s)]
*  as a scholar to my [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=170.0s)]
*  university and to my work. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=172.0s)]
*  And so we spoke on the phone. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=174.0s)]
*  We decided we would have two [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=176.0s)]
*  academic forums at the Dartmouth [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=178.0s)]
*  College campus [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=180.0s)]
*  and set those up. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=182.0s)]
*  I was one of them and the others [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=184.0s)]
*  were three other scholars [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=186.0s)]
*  who are teaching in Middle [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=188.0s)]
*  Eastern studies. I have to say the Jewish [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=190.0s)]
*  studies and Middle Eastern studies have [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=192.0s)]
*  had a long and very fruitful [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=194.0s)]
*  collaboration on campus. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=196.0s)]
*  So we have relationships. We co-teach [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=198.0s)]
*  courses. I'm co-teaching a course [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=200.0s)]
*  with Professor Jonathan Smolin from Middle [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=202.0s)]
*  Eastern studies this term [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=204.0s)]
*  on the 1967 Arab [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=206.0s)]
*  Israeli War. And so [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=208.0s)]
*  he spoke and then we have another [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=210.0s)]
*  course on Israel-Palestine [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=212.0s)]
*  co-taught by [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=214.0s)]
*  Bernard Abishai and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=216.0s)]
*  Esedin Fashir from government. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=218.0s)]
*  So we [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=220.0s)]
*  offered this as a panel to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=222.0s)]
*  demonstrate to the college, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=224.0s)]
*  students and faculty [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=226.0s)]
*  how we come together in this moment. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=228.0s)]
*  We model for them [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=230.0s)]
*  what it is to be a scholar, what it is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=232.0s)]
*  to be an academic at an academic [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=234.0s)]
*  institution to discuss the [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=236.0s)]
*  issues thoughtfully, not [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=238.0s)]
*  to look for condemnations [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=240.0s)]
*  or to speak [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=242.0s)]
*  about emotions, but to think [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=244.0s)]
*  in context, what [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=246.0s)]
*  can we as scholars contribute [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=248.0s)]
*  to the analysis of this [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=250.0s)]
*  moment and also [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=252.0s)]
*  demonstrate how we should [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=254.0s)]
*  think in this moment. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=256.0s)]
*  How should we be responding [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=258.0s)]
*  as academics? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=260.0s)]
*  And that we felt also [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=262.0s)]
*  what we succeeded in doing, really, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=264.0s)]
*  at Dartmouth was to keep [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=266.0s)]
*  all sides together [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=268.0s)]
*  as a community of academics, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=270.0s)]
*  which is exactly what we do in our [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=272.0s)]
*  classroom. One of the reasons we called [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=274.0s)]
*  you is that we saw an article in the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=276.0s)]
*  forward titled, Many Universities [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=278.0s)]
*  Fumbled Reactions to Hamas's [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=280.0s)]
*  Attack. Here is how Dartmouth [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=282.0s)]
*  got it right. Did the administration [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=284.0s)]
*  play any role in this? Because as we've [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=286.0s)]
*  seen in a number of other universities, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=288.0s)]
*  university presidents have been [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=290.0s)]
*  heavily criticized for [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=292.0s)]
*  not speaking or not saying enough [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=294.0s)]
*  or not saying something soon enough. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=296.0s)]
*  Absolutely. We have a new president, a [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=298.0s)]
*  Dartmouth president, Sian Bylock, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=300.0s)]
*  who immediately said, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=302.0s)]
*  we have to do something. And she [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=304.0s)]
*  asked the dean of faculty, Elizabeth Smith, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=306.0s)]
*  to call me, and she did. And I told [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=308.0s)]
*  her Monday morning early, we've already [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=310.0s)]
*  made plans to do something. So [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=312.0s)]
*  the leadership at Dartmouth has been very [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=314.0s)]
*  strong and very much [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=316.0s)]
*  in support of what [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=318.0s)]
*  we are doing as faculty. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=320.0s)]
*  And that has made a huge difference [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=322.0s)]
*  as well. Tell me about that first [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=324.0s)]
*  forum. What was it like? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=326.0s)]
*  We recognized that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=328.0s)]
*  students, faculty, staff, the community [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=330.0s)]
*  were all very upset, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=332.0s)]
*  frightened, worried, and angry. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=334.0s)]
*  And Dartmouth does offer 24 [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=336.0s)]
*  hour a day mental [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=338.0s)]
*  health counseling for [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=340.0s)]
*  students, for example. And we emphasize [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=342.0s)]
*  that. We also have chaplains [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=344.0s)]
*  to speak to students and [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=347.0s)]
*  to faculty. And that's also important. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=349.0s)]
*  But our job at these forums was [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=351.0s)]
*  to come together as academics [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=353.0s)]
*  to demonstrate what we do [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=355.0s)]
*  in our classrooms. When we co-teach a [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=357.0s)]
*  course, Professor Elirese and I co-teach [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=359.0s)]
*  a course called Arabs, Jews, and Modernity, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=361.0s)]
*  we have students who are Jewish [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=363.0s)]
*  Christian, Muslim, from all over the world, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=365.0s)]
*  Palestinian students. We come together [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=367.0s)]
*  in the classroom to understand, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=369.0s)]
*  work together, to think [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=371.0s)]
*  through the problems. And the classroom [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=373.0s)]
*  becomes a place where students [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=375.0s)]
*  work together and form friendships [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=377.0s)]
*  and think together. So [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=379.0s)]
*  we don't polarize. And that's [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=381.0s)]
*  what we wanted to achieve with these forums. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=383.0s)]
*  And that actually did happen. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=385.0s)]
*  And of course there are students who are very [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=387.0s)]
*  upset emotionally. I was too. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=389.0s)]
*  I still am very upset. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=391.0s)]
*  But that's not, as a professional, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=393.0s)]
*  what I bring to my classroom. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=395.0s)]
*  That classroom is a different [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=397.0s)]
*  kind of space. It's not [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=399.0s)]
*  a space to rant and rave [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=401.0s)]
*  and do agitation and propaganda [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=403.0s)]
*  and demagoguery. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=405.0s)]
*  Classroom is a place for scholarship. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=407.0s)]
*  Professor Elirese, when [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=409.0s)]
*  you did get back to campus [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=411.0s)]
*  and started participating in these [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=413.0s)]
*  conversations, what are some of the things [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=415.0s)]
*  that you heard? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=417.0s)]
*  The students started coming to my office. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=419.0s)]
*  And I opened my office to them to hear [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=421.0s)]
*  what they're feeling, what they're thinking, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=423.0s)]
*  and to support them [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=425.0s)]
*  and to be there with them. And also [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=427.0s)]
*  as Professor Heschel mentioned, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=429.0s)]
*  we have students from [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=431.0s)]
*  different backgrounds [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=433.0s)]
*  and different political [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=435.0s)]
*  views, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=437.0s)]
*  positions that are in our classes. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=439.0s)]
*  And they come to our classes because [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=441.0s)]
*  they feel like we are able [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=443.0s)]
*  to maintain a conversation where [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=445.0s)]
*  their views are respected. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=447.0s)]
*  And also we're not imposing any [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=449.0s)]
*  of our views on them. And we [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=451.0s)]
*  try to encourage them to [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=453.0s)]
*  form their own perspective when they [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=455.0s)]
*  look at how Jews and Arabs work [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=457.0s)]
*  together throughout the 19th century [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=459.0s)]
*  in the Middle East and other parts [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=461.0s)]
*  of the world, how they defended each [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=463.0s)]
*  other's causes. I mean, it's a history [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=465.0s)]
*  of common struggle as well, sometimes [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=467.0s)]
*  in relation to European [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=469.0s)]
*  colonialism or various forms [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=471.0s)]
*  of biases. So we also [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=473.0s)]
*  in our work try to present [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=475.0s)]
*  a different kind of history of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=477.0s)]
*  living together. And students [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=479.0s)]
*  come to this from [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=481.0s)]
*  Jewish students, Palestinian students, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=483.0s)]
*  and they know each other and they come [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=485.0s)]
*  with us on our study abroad. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=487.0s)]
*  There is a connection between them. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=489.0s)]
*  So when these things happen, they are still [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=491.0s)]
*  talking. And this is important. I ask [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=493.0s)]
*  the students, are you still, you know, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=495.0s)]
*  how so-and-so? You know, I'm asking [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=497.0s)]
*  a Jewish student about how a Palestinian [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=499.0s)]
*  student is doing, you know, and vice [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=501.0s)]
*  versa. And I think it's important [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=503.0s)]
*  that we play that role, that we, you know, engage intellectually, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=505.0s)]
*  explain the complexity [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=507.0s)]
*  of histories and conflicts, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=509.0s)]
*  but at the same time, to maintain [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=511.0s)]
*  a community of care. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=513.0s)]
*  We are here to support them. We are here to listen [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=515.0s)]
*  to them. And we want them to support [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=517.0s)]
*  each other as well. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=519.0s)]
*  One of the things, you know, you hear from students [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=521.0s)]
*  who are Muslim or Palestinian or Arab, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=523.0s)]
*  you know, or all three, is that they feel [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=525.0s)]
*  that they have been silenced. They feel that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=527.0s)]
*  they can't express [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=529.0s)]
*  their own feelings. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=531.0s)]
*  They feel that they can't express [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=533.0s)]
*  their, you know, legitimate [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=535.0s)]
*  fear, anger, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=537.0s)]
*  concern. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=539.0s)]
*  I mean, on the one hand, you have the Jewish students who are [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=541.0s)]
*  deeply afraid, and legitimately [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=543.0s)]
*  so. And then you also have Arab and [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=545.0s)]
*  Palestinian and Muslim students who are deeply [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=547.0s)]
*  afraid, for different reasons. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=549.0s)]
*  And I can imagine where they might look to you [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=551.0s)]
*  to be a spokesman for them. And I'm just interested in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=553.0s)]
*  your take on all this. Absolutely. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=555.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And I engage them [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=557.0s)]
*  and we create forums [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=559.0s)]
*  for them, also to go to the students [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=561.0s)]
*  in their own [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=563.0s)]
*  comfortable, safe [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=565.0s)]
*  spaces, so that people can come [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=567.0s)]
*  and talk to them and ask them and see how [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=569.0s)]
*  not only what they think, but also how [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=571.0s)]
*  they feel. So we're very, very, you know, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=573.0s)]
*  very much doing this. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=575.0s)]
*  But I think also there is a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=577.0s)]
*  frustration. It's understandable [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=579.0s)]
*  that there is frustration that the political [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=581.0s)]
*  resolution of this conflict has not [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=583.0s)]
*  happened. The emphasis has been on, like, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=585.0s)]
*  security measures and containment [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=587.0s)]
*  and management, rather than a real [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=589.0s)]
*  political solution. And I think [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=591.0s)]
*  it's important for us, also as [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=593.0s)]
*  academics, we understand [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=595.0s)]
*  the frustration that the political solution [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=597.0s)]
*  through talks, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=599.0s)]
*  you know, historically has [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=601.0s)]
*  fumbled. But also we need to, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=603.0s)]
*  what else do we have? I mean, for [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=605.0s)]
*  us, other than [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=607.0s)]
*  conversation, other than engagement, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=609.0s)]
*  other than engaging the other and trying to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=611.0s)]
*  show the other side [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=613.0s)]
*  your perspective, and do it in a way [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=615.0s)]
*  that brings them in, rather than alienate [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=617.0s)]
*  them at the outset. Has anybody [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=619.0s)]
*  criticized you for not being [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=621.0s)]
*  angry enough? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=623.0s)]
*  Professor El-Arisa, I'm just curious, if anybody has [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=625.0s)]
*  criticized you for not being outraged enough? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=627.0s)]
*  I mean, I lived 15 [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=631.0s)]
*  years in a civil war [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=633.0s)]
*  situation under all kinds [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=635.0s)]
*  of bombs. And [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=637.0s)]
*  it took me a long time to [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=639.0s)]
*  deal with that and deal [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=641.0s)]
*  with the anger, but also to transform the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=643.0s)]
*  anger into something [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=645.0s)]
*  more constructive. But I also [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=647.0s)]
*  see the frustration in the students [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=649.0s)]
*  who feel like they want to do [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=651.0s)]
*  something and they can't do anything. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=653.0s)]
*  And they feel, but it is also [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=655.0s)]
*  like there is a culture out there [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=657.0s)]
*  that's expecting students [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=659.0s)]
*  at the university, freshmen [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=661.0s)]
*  and so on, to somehow have [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=663.0s)]
*  the power to change [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=665.0s)]
*  a human rights situation [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=667.0s)]
*  or to intervene in a political situation. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=669.0s)]
*  And that's not fair. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=671.0s)]
*  That's a huge burden on that student [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=673.0s)]
*  and that's crushing in some way. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=675.0s)]
*  And part of what we have to do, I [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=677.0s)]
*  want to, on the one hand, alleviate [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=679.0s)]
*  that burden to act [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=681.0s)]
*  and also [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=683.0s)]
*  and say, I understand [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=685.0s)]
*  the frustration, and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=687.0s)]
*  but also I need [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=689.0s)]
*  to calm them down, make them listen [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=691.0s)]
*  and also try to explain to them a [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=693.0s)]
*  larger picture and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=695.0s)]
*  bring them into a larger picture. And then [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=697.0s)]
*  bring them also to talk about people [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=699.0s)]
*  who feel that burden on the other side [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=701.0s)]
*  or from the other perspective. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=703.0s)]
*  And if we cut those ties, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=705.0s)]
*  if we create those walls [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=707.0s)]
*  that separate, say, okay, I won't [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=709.0s)]
*  talk to the other's camp because [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=711.0s)]
*  this is what I believe and it is absolute. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=713.0s)]
*  Then where do we go from here? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=715.0s)]
*  I mean, will we still have education [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=717.0s)]
*  the way we understand it? I mean, this is [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=719.0s)]
*  how I'm trained as [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=721.0s)]
*  a humanist, as someone who's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=723.0s)]
*  invested in talking to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=725.0s)]
*  the other person. I mean, I can [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=727.0s)]
*  not just simply say, I won't talk, this is my view [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=729.0s)]
*  and that's it, take it or leave it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=731.0s)]
*  I will do anything to achieve [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=733.0s)]
*  my views. This is not also [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=735.0s)]
*  this is not my [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=737.0s)]
*  mission as an educator. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=739.0s)]
*  Professor Heschel, I just want to ask you [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=741.0s)]
*  the same thing. I mean, do people have any [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=743.0s)]
*  has anyone said this to you? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=745.0s)]
*  That you should be on this side [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=747.0s)]
*  or that you're not outraged enough? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=749.0s)]
*  Has anyone said that to you? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=751.0s)]
*  I'm sure people think it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=753.0s)]
*  And [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=755.0s)]
*  I know that I have colleagues [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=757.0s)]
*  at other institutions who've said [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=759.0s)]
*  that a Jewish studies professor [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=761.0s)]
*  should represent the Jewish [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=763.0s)]
*  studies or the Jewish community, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=765.0s)]
*  the Jewish Federation on campus and so on. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=767.0s)]
*  That's not the role of an [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=769.0s)]
*  academic. I want [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=771.0s)]
*  my classroom to be a place [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=773.0s)]
*  where all students feel comfortable. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=775.0s)]
*  People will sometimes ask me, well, how [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=777.0s)]
*  many of your students are Jewish? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=779.0s)]
*  When I have a big class, I don't know. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=781.0s)]
*  I don't know who's Jewish. I don't know [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=783.0s)]
*  I don't know who's Jewish and who isn't. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=785.0s)]
*  And why should I want to know that? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=787.0s)]
*  We're here to study together. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=789.0s)]
*  And I have students from all kinds [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=791.0s)]
*  of parts of the world, students from China [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=793.0s)]
*  and Pakistan and Vietnam. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=795.0s)]
*  And they're interested. And I want them [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=797.0s)]
*  to come and feel perfectly [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=799.0s)]
*  comfortable and equal to every other [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=801.0s)]
*  student in the classroom. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=803.0s)]
*  One of the things I'm hearing from you is that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=805.0s)]
*  several things came to play here. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=807.0s)]
*  You had longstanding prior [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=809.0s)]
*  relationships of mutual [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=811.0s)]
*  respect. Okay. You had [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=813.0s)]
*  a history of not just [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=815.0s)]
*  working together, but [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=817.0s)]
*  being very clear [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=819.0s)]
*  about your role in a time of crisis. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=821.0s)]
*  And you've also kind of have deep friendships among [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=823.0s)]
*  yourselves. And I'm just wondering [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=825.0s)]
*  why is this so hard? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=827.0s)]
*  It just seems that a number [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=829.0s)]
*  of these sort of prominent universities [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=831.0s)]
*  that things seem [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=833.0s)]
*  to have kind of spun out of control. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=835.0s)]
*  I mean, you have kids sending [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=837.0s)]
*  hate messages. You have kids [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=839.0s)]
*  tearing down posters of other [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=841.0s)]
*  people's, you know, posters [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=843.0s)]
*  amplifying the people who've been taken [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=845.0s)]
*  hostage. Why does it seem so [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=847.0s)]
*  hard in some of these places? Do you have a theory [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=849.0s)]
*  about that? Yes. Well, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=851.0s)]
*  this is something we're going [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=853.0s)]
*  to be thinking about for a long time to come. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=855.0s)]
*  What brought us to this point? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=857.0s)]
*  And there are many factors. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=859.0s)]
*  Institutional leadership is one. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=861.0s)]
*  We have a great leader who knew [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=863.0s)]
*  what to do. And of course, the friendships and the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=865.0s)]
*  relationships, we can't just plunge right in. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=867.0s)]
*  Why is it that so many Jewish studies [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=869.0s)]
*  and Middle Eastern studies programs at different [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=871.0s)]
*  universities are at war with each [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=873.0s)]
*  other? They don't talk to each other. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=875.0s)]
*  We collaborate in courses [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=877.0s)]
*  that are cross-listed, co-taught [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=879.0s)]
*  programs that we organize together [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=881.0s)]
*  and so on. So we've been doing this for a long time. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=883.0s)]
*  Sometimes it may be uncomfortable. Of [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=885.0s)]
*  course, we may hear things from a guest [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=887.0s)]
*  speaker that we don't like. But we don't bring [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=889.0s)]
*  in guest speakers as mouthpieces for [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=891.0s)]
*  ourselves. We bring in speakers [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=893.0s)]
*  who will challenge us. And that's what we do [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=895.0s)]
*  in our classroom. I give students something [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=897.0s)]
*  to read, and I'll say, well, now [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=899.0s)]
*  what would you say in response [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=901.0s)]
*  to this? What's your argument? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=903.0s)]
*  How do you formulate it? What's the evidence? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=905.0s)]
*  What's wrong with this article? And what's right [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=907.0s)]
*  with it? And if you don't like it, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=909.0s)]
*  say something, but say it in an [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=911.0s)]
*  academic, intelligent way that has [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=913.0s)]
*  warrants for the proof. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=915.0s)]
*  So those are some of the factors. And there are other [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=917.0s)]
*  elements as well. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=919.0s)]
*  So a student in one of the forums said, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=921.0s)]
*  is Israel an apartheid state? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=923.0s)]
*  And the response was, look, first of all, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=925.0s)]
*  it doesn't really fit the definition. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=927.0s)]
*  But, you know, another response is to say, we're [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=929.0s)]
*  not here to judge. We're here to understand. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=931.0s)]
*  I'm not a judge in a courtroom. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=933.0s)]
*  I'm not a jury. I'm an academic. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=935.0s)]
*  I want to analyze. I want to think. What [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=937.0s)]
*  is the purpose of, say, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=939.0s)]
*  defining something as apartheid [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=941.0s)]
*  or defining an incident, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=943.0s)]
*  which may be terrible? The bombing [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=945.0s)]
*  in Gaza, killing of people [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=947.0s)]
*  is a terrible thing. Why [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=949.0s)]
*  do I have to call it genocide? Can I [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=951.0s)]
*  just say this is terrible? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=953.0s)]
*  When Hamas attacked Israeli civilians, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=955.0s)]
*  it is terrible. It's [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=957.0s)]
*  devastating. Fourteen hundred people [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=959.0s)]
*  murdered, innocent civilians. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=961.0s)]
*  But I want to analyze. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=963.0s)]
*  I want to think it through. How did we get [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=965.0s)]
*  to this point? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=967.0s)]
*  And I don't want to simply fit it into [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=969.0s)]
*  a prior narrative, whether [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=971.0s)]
*  it's a colonial narrative or something [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=973.0s)]
*  else. And that's what [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=975.0s)]
*  I think we're stuck, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=977.0s)]
*  many of us in our academic work, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=979.0s)]
*  we're stuck in predetermined narratives. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=981.0s)]
*  We're stuck in what [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=983.0s)]
*  the philosopher Carl Hempel called covering [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=985.0s)]
*  laws. And we need [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=987.0s)]
*  to break out of that and think in more [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=989.0s)]
*  expansive terms and analyze [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=991.0s)]
*  more carefully and creatively. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=993.0s)]
*  And also think about [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=995.0s)]
*  what we are trying to accomplish, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=997.0s)]
*  not to label, not to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=999.0s)]
*  judge, but actually to move forward. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1001.0s)]
*  Because we have, ultimately, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1003.0s)]
*  as academics, we [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1005.0s)]
*  have a commitment to humanity, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1007.0s)]
*  to human lives. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1009.0s)]
*  Professor, I'll ask you [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1011.0s)]
*  this, but these are kids. I mean, some of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1013.0s)]
*  them are kids. I mean, some of the reason that they go to [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1015.0s)]
*  college is to figure out who they are. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1017.0s)]
*  I mean, overdoing it, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1019.0s)]
*  you know, doing too much, saying [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1021.0s)]
*  too much, saying the wrong thing, that's part [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1023.0s)]
*  of growing up on the one hand, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1025.0s)]
*  right? And I'm just, I mean, you know, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1027.0s)]
*  the students who said [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1029.0s)]
*  Israel apartheid said, but I said [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1031.0s)]
*  it in such a respectful way, said, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1033.0s)]
*  what do you think if I would say [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1035.0s)]
*  Israel is an apartheid? And thank you for [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1037.0s)]
*  answering my question. I mean, this is [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1039.0s)]
*  what I retain from that also. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1041.0s)]
*  It is also the way, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1043.0s)]
*  it is not what you say. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1045.0s)]
*  It is the way you say it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1047.0s)]
*  And it is also to have [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1049.0s)]
*  an environment that allows you to say what you [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1051.0s)]
*  want to say without [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1053.0s)]
*  completely [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1055.0s)]
*  getting rid, canceling the other. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1057.0s)]
*  You know, disagreement doesn't mean [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1059.0s)]
*  an erasure, and that's what's very important [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1061.0s)]
*  to hold on to. I can [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1063.0s)]
*  disagree with you. I can have my strong [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1065.0s)]
*  feeling about things and say them, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1067.0s)]
*  but I have to find a way [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1069.0s)]
*  where I'm not, you know, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1071.0s)]
*  completely not letting the other person [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1073.0s)]
*  speak also and express their [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1075.0s)]
*  view or their opinion and [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1077.0s)]
*  their feeling as well. So I think our role is [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1079.0s)]
*  really to create that space [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1081.0s)]
*  where one [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1083.0s)]
*  feeling, one voice doesn't cancel the other. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1085.0s)]
*  Professor Tarek Al-Ariz, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1087.0s)]
*  Professor Susana Heschel, thank you so much [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1089.0s)]
*  for talking with us today. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1091.0s)]
*  I believe that your words will be [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1093.0s)]
*  a bomb to many people. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1095.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBCmpqn708&t=1097.0s)]
