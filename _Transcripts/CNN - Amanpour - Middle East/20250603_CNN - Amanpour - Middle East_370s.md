Video Description: "Unconscionable." This was how the United Nations' Human Rights Chief termed the fatal attacks on Palestinians trying to reach aid in Gaza. Chaos erupted at a distribution site in Rafah today, where Gaza's Health Ministry says Israeli forces opened fire. At least 27 Gazans are dead and dozens more injured. It's the third day in a row that people have been killed on their way to collect critically needed aid at the site, which is run by the controversial new "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation." This time the Israeli military says its forces did open fire multiple times, after identifying quote "several suspects moving toward them, deviating from the designated access routes."  For more on the desperate need for aid in Gaza, the President of Save the Children U.S., Janti Soeripto, joins the show from Washington.

# President of Save the Children U.S. on the Desperate Need for Aid in Gaza | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk)
*  For more now on that desperate need for aid in Gaza and the controversial new distribution [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=0.0s)]
*  operation there, I'm joined by Yanti Serypto, who is president and CEO of Save the Children [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=4.0s)]
*  U.S. in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=9.76s)]
*  Yanti, thank you so much for taking the time. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=11.84s)]
*  Just given the headlines, the chaos and confusion that has ensued since this Gaza humanitarian [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=14.36s)]
*  fund has started distributing aid, just give us your thoughts and what you're hearing from [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=21.44s)]
*  those on the ground there from your team about what these last eight days have been like, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  because it has been eight days now that this humanitarian fund has been operational. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=34.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  And let's also remind ourselves that it's been since March 2nd that we haven't seen [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=41.56s)]
*  any supplies come into Gaza at all. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=46.4s)]
*  So just to get a sense of the level of scarcity and the level of desperation there for the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  population of Gaza who are essentially wanting for everything, basic health care, clean water, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=56.52s)]
*  food, baby milk, et cetera, for well over 80 days now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=63.0s)]
*  So that's the starting position. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=68.08s)]
*  Then these last eight days, we're watching an abject horror, of course, because A, we [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=70.12s)]
*  have said all along that this new mechanism wasn't fit for purpose, was untested, was [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=75.08s)]
*  woefully inefficient in terms of the number of sites, and also doesn't really address [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=81.0s)]
*  all of the issues in particularly for children and a vulnerable population to address their needs. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  This is not just about food boxes that people then have to carry, as Jeremy said, for miles [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=93.34s)]
*  and miles sort of on their shoulders that you then still need clean water for to actually [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=98.62s)]
*  prepare before you have any food. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=103.98s)]
*  But it doesn't address basic health care needs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't address care for pregnant women. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  It doesn't address care for infants and young children. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=111.5s)]
*  It doesn't address malnutrition treatment for severely malnourished children who are [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=114.8s)]
*  at death's door. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=119.24s)]
*  So it is a woefully inadequate plan, badly executed, and it is actually doing even more [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=120.24s)]
*  harm to a population that has already been through so much. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=125.74s)]
*  This Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, there's still so much uncertainty about who is running [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=130.4s)]
*  it these days now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=135.48s)]
*  It seems almost daily we're hearing new headlines. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=136.98s)]
*  The founder left I think on day one of this distribution, and now The Washington Post [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=141.08s)]
*  is reporting that the Boston Consulting Group, who helped design the operation, has withdrawn [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=147.32000000000002s)]
*  from the team as well. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=153.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm just curious because I know there's a lot of distrust between Israel, between this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=154.32000000000002s)]
*  foundation and the United Nations per se, but did anyone reach out, solicit advice from [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=158.28s)]
*  from Save the Children before launching this operation to get a sense of what this would [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=165.36s)]
*  be like? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=172.68s)]
*  Look, I mean, you describe it well, and the chaos tells you everything around who is running [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=173.68s)]
*  it, who is actually in charge, who helped design, who didn't help design, you know, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=180.56s)]
*  who was on the board of this foundation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Look, all humanitarian agencies who have been operational in Gaza most of the time for many, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=187.56s)]
*  many decades have weighed in when first ideas of this plan were mooted a few months ago, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=193.08s)]
*  and we've identified exactly the issues we saw with it. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=201.08s)]
*  It seemed to be a militarization of aid. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=204.96s)]
*  It seemed to be really tricky, risky, additionally risky for people to actually walk for miles [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=207.52s)]
*  to pick up a box. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=213.76s)]
*  It doesn't address all the needs that need to be, it doesn't address all the aid supplies, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=215.04s)]
*  all the assistance that needs to be given to the population in Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=221.64s)]
*  And it would be, you know, the whole supply chain and protocols that we asked for, standard [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  operating procedures that we asked for, didn't seem to be in place. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=233.76s)]
*  So we have weighed in with our concerns. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=237.16s)]
*  Sometimes we were asked for those concerns, sometimes we gave them proactively, but we've [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=240.2s)]
*  been very clear from the start that we didn't feel that this was a mechanism that would [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=244.6s)]
*  actually deliver quality humanitarian assistance at scale. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=250.6s)]
*  What are the biggest concerns you have now, specifically as it relates to children? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=254.24s)]
*  So we see an enormous amount of children being really at risk of literally starvation. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=262.32s)]
*  You know, the latest numbers there, as we know, for over 80 days nothing has been able [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=270.8s)]
*  to get in. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=276.2s)]
*  So there is essentially a want for everything, but we are particularly concerned about very [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=277.24s)]
*  young children starving to death. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=281.64s)]
*  We are concerned about children being hurt in some of the kinetic activity on the ground. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=284.92s)]
*  So they need basic health care, they need vaccines and immunization, they need treatment [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=290.64s)]
*  for malnutrition, they need treatment for wounds, for shelling, injuries, etc. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  So above all, they need the fighting to stop. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=306.8s)]
*  So we need to go back to the situation that we had before March 2nd, which was a ceasefire. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=309.4s)]
*  It was giving, all the gates were open, humanitarian supplies came in, over 500 trucks a day, a mix [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  of commercial and humanitarian supplies were in. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=322.48s)]
*  We were able to treat people in communities where they were, close to where they were living, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=326.0s)]
*  and we were able to find kids that needed the most urgent care. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=332.36s)]
*  So the mechanisms that were there during the ceasefire were working at scale, and we were [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=337.68s)]
*  able to do it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=343.84000000000003s)]
*  We and everybody else operating in Gaza was able to deliver humanitarian assistance with [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  quality and care. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  And that is currently not the situation at all. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wprv5m8X4Tk&t=352.56s)]
