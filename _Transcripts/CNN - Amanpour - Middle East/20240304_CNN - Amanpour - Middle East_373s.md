# Life in Gaza: "We Are Humans, We Deserve a Better Life" | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [March 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA)
*  Diana, tell me what daily food and water is to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=0.0s)]
*  What access do you have? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=5.44s)]
*  Actually, it's a struggle to me. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=8.08s)]
*  I wake up every day, I just think [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=10.24s)]
*  how I will get the water or the food. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=12.52s)]
*  I have to wait long to get some food or water. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=17.02s)]
*  While the water, it's not healthy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=21.62s)]
*  We use the same water to drink and shower [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=23.76s)]
*  and to wash the dishes and for everything. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=27.76s)]
*  So the water, it's not healthy. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=30.76s)]
*  I'm going to play a little video [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=32.760000000000005s)]
*  from something you have recorded [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=34.34s)]
*  because you have followers [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=36.36s)]
*  and you're posting your daily life. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=37.74s)]
*  So I'm going to play this little video now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=39.74s)]
*  Hi, it's Diana from Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=42.24s)]
*  Today, I wanna show you where I live with my family [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=43.74s)]
*  since I evacuated to Rappah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Actually, I live in this small space [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=47.72s)]
*  because we share one class with many families. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=50.38s)]
*  So we have only this small space. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=52.42s)]
*  And you might ask me why we arranged a bit [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  of tables this way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=58.08s)]
*  Actually, it's my mom's idea. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=58.92s)]
*  She thinks that when we put our heads this way, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=60.38s)]
*  protects us from any bombings or any airstrikes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=64.08s)]
*  Wow, so you're telling people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=68.76s)]
*  that not only do you not have enough to eat and drink, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=70.5s)]
*  but you also have to worry about the bombs [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=73.76s)]
*  and the drones overhead. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=76.0s)]
*  Have you experienced that? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=78.2s)]
*  What is it like when your environment is bombed? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=79.6s)]
*  It's so scary. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=84.82s)]
*  You know, I'm 22 years old and I live all that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=87.16s)]
*  You know, it's okay about me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=91.86s)]
*  What about the little children? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=93.25999999999999s)]
*  Just think about them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  Put yourself or think how if you're a child, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=97.33999999999999s)]
*  instead of them under these bombs, what will you do? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=102.84s)]
*  They are humans. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=107.97999999999999s)]
*  They are just a child. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  We are humans. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=110.08s)]
*  We deserve better life. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=111.02s)]
*  We deserve peace, Christian. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=112.8s)]
*  Diana, tell me how the children and the younger people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  in your family group react. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=118.78s)]
*  I think all of us have trauma now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=121.52s)]
*  They all have a trauma. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=125.86s)]
*  They keep with their hands this way. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=127.72s)]
*  They are afraid all the time. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=131.8s)]
*  They shaking like this all the time. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=133.32s)]
*  We all have a trauma now, Christian. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=135.9s)]
*  Can I ask you something very basic? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=139.74s)]
*  You tried just to survive, can you? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=141.56s)]
*  Yes, you tried to survive. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you something just as basic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=145.56s)]
*  How do you go to the bathroom? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=148.1s)]
*  How do you have places, especially women [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=150.14s)]
*  who need feminine hygiene, who need proper sanitation, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=153.5s)]
*  who can't go out to the back of a tent [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=157.48s)]
*  and just pee like men do? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=159.68s)]
*  How do you take care of those needs? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=162.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=167.12s)]
*  Actually, you asked me about all the struggles. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=168.92s)]
*  I just figured out that all my life is a struggle right now. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=172.23999999999998s)]
*  I have to wait to use the bathroom. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=176.14s)]
*  I have to wait for hours to take a shower. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=182.04s)]
*  About the sanitary pads, it's not always available. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=185.82s)]
*  So I try to find whatever I can find [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=188.92s)]
*  to use it as sanitary pads. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=191.72s)]
*  And it's not only my situation. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=195.26s)]
*  It's all the girls' situation here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  And how many meals a day do you eat, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=200.34s)]
*  as bad as it is in the North? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=203.58s)]
*  What do you eat and how many people [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=205.28s)]
*  are you living with in your space? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=207.22000000000003s)]
*  Actually, I'm lucky if I got two meals a day. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=211.18s)]
*  I try just to eat one meal [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=215.26000000000002s)]
*  so we can have food for the other day. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=220.06s)]
*  And I share the space with the class. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=225.14000000000001s)]
*  I live with many families, like 10 families. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=228.98s)]
*  And what's it like when you can't communicate, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  not just to people like me, but people, your neighbors, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=236.46s)]
*  people who may still be in Gaza City, who you know, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  people in the North? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=243.16s)]
*  There's no answer. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  Most of them don't have electricity [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=245.9s)]
*  and have solar power, so they can't contact me. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=249.16s)]
*  So I have no idea about them. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=253.24s)]
*  I have nothing to know about them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=256.74s)]
*  And Diana, are you and your family and friends [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=259.68s)]
*  and the people you're with in Ra'afah, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=262.4s)]
*  are they afraid of a grounded offensive [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=264.38s)]
*  or some kind of massive offensive, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=267.52s)]
*  Israeli offensive on Ra'afah? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=269.24s)]
*  Actually, we are all very scared. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=272.32s)]
*  More innocent people would be killed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=277.96s)]
*  No one wants more fighting. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=279.96s)]
*  We are praying for peace. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=282.15999999999997s)]
*  The world must take action [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=284.28s)]
*  to prevent modern century massacre in Ra'afah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=285.4s)]
*  If that happens, it will be a modern century massacre, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=288.0s)]
*  Christian, in Ra'afah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  This, we have seen a grand invasion of Ra'afah [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=294.08s)]
*  would mean the death and suffering of thousands. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  There are innocent people. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=302.0s)]
*  Imagine an army taking the last bullet. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=303.18s)]
*  You have left, no? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=307.9s)]
*  Imagine you are a child with no parents in Ra'afah. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=309.52s)]
*  You know, most of the child's lost of parents here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=315.48s)]
*  Who will keep you safe? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=321.64s)]
*  The world leaders must protect us, Christian. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=323.8s)]
*  You know, this war or this genocide [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=329.68s)]
*  showed us how the people are good [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=334.44s)]
*  and how the leaders are evil. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=337.68s)]
*  It showed us the truth. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=342.54s)]
*  Christian. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=345.4s)]
*  Diana, thank you very, very much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=347.6s)]
*  And we will continue to pursue your stories. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=349.48s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=351.96s)]
*  Good luck to you. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=353.56s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=354.92s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7UvmswYZbA&t=356.64s)]
