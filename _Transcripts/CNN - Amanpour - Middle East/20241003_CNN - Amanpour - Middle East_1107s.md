# Ta-Nehisi Coates on Visit to Israel/West Bank: “An Immoral Apartheid Regime” | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo)
*  Now, our next guest says that he must confront the truth, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=0.0s)]
*  no matter how difficult. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  The award-winning journalist, Tanahasi Coates, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=5.4s)]
*  is doing exactly that in his new book, The Message, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=7.8s)]
*  in which he journeys to Senegal, Israel, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=10.9s)]
*  and the occupied West Bank, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  and he's joining Michel Martin to discuss what he found. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=15.24s)]
*  Thanks, Christian. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=19.68s)]
*  Tanahasi Coates, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=20.72s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Michelle. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=23.38s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of people know your previous work, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=24.78s)]
*  especially between the world and me, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=27.92s)]
*  but in this new book, you go to three different places. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=29.66s)]
*  You write about your trips to three different places, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=34.66s)]
*  to Senegal, to South Carolina, and to Israel, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=37.0s)]
*  and to the Palestinian territories. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=40.06s)]
*  You've already gotten a lot of attention for this book, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=41.9s)]
*  some of it quite heated, it has to be said, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=44.36s)]
*  but I want to start where you start in the book, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  which is Senegal. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=48.08s)]
*  I mean, this was your first trip there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  You describe these feelings of real disquiet [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=51.5s)]
*  while you were there, sort of fear, just sadness, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=55.34s)]
*  and that kind of a heaviness. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=59.24s)]
*  Can you just describe why, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=60.58s)]
*  or what it is that you were feeling, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=63.28s)]
*  and why you think you were feeling that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=66.12s)]
*  I'm of the generation of children born in, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=68.28s)]
*  I guess, the 70s, or maybe it started in the late 60s, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=71.48s)]
*  where it became popular to give your kids African names, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  and to really raise children with different views [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=77.9s)]
*  and different notions of Africa, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=82.06s)]
*  and different ideas of Africa. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=83.54s)]
*  And that effort really was to overcome a very racist telling [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=85.72s)]
*  and stories of what Africa was, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=91.86s)]
*  and thus to justify the treatment of African-Americans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=93.7s)]
*  And that in turn was counted [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=96.5s)]
*  with different versions of history, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=97.76s)]
*  some of them themselves quite mythical. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=101.7s)]
*  But here I was confronted with the real thing, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=105.2s)]
*  no more stories, no more narratives. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=108.14s)]
*  This is it, buddy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=110.78s)]
*  This is actually what it is. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=112.12s)]
*  And I was going to be crafting stories of my own, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=114.8s)]
*  to say nothing of the fact, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=117.98s)]
*  which I actually think I took for granted, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=119.0s)]
*  that this really was, in some profound way, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=120.98s)]
*  as cliche as it is, the motherland. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=124.48s)]
*  That was really where I was going. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=127.08s)]
*  And so I was terribly affected, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=128.98s)]
*  and maybe I was not totally prepared to be affected. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=133.18s)]
*  Can I throw something out, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=136.32s)]
*  or were you afraid that you would be disappointed? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=137.36s)]
*  Disappointed, no, because of the age I went. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=140.52s)]
*  It was the age I went. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=142.9s)]
*  And I understand why a lot of people are afraid by that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=144.22s)]
*  But actually, as I'm reflecting on your question, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=147.34s)]
*  maybe I was. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=149.06s)]
*  One of the things I talk about [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=150.4s)]
*  is lurking in the back of my mind was, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=151.66s)]
*  what if all of those racist narratives were actually true? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=154.3s)]
*  That's terrible to admit. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=158.78s)]
*  But certainly that was in the back of my mind [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=161.42000000000002s)]
*  is something that was haunting me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=163.94s)]
*  I didn't expect to be welcomed with drums [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=165.54s)]
*  and welcome home, brother. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=169.38s)]
*  Brother, yes. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=171.06s)]
*  No, no, I didn't expect any of that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=172.26s)]
*  That wasn't what I was looking for. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=174.18s)]
*  But like I said, it is terrible to admit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=176.92s)]
*  Perhaps I feared that I would not find [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  a city in Dakar of human beings. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  That is a hard thing to admit. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=185.66s)]
*  So what do you think you found there [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=186.96s)]
*  that is important to the overall narrative [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=188.74s)]
*  that you're sharing in this book? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=192.57999999999998s)]
*  The first essay, and I guess we'll talk about this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=195.78s)]
*  in a minute, and the last essay, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=197.42s)]
*  are kind of in conversation with each other. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=198.54s)]
*  When you've had a horrific, violent event happen to you, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  such that it really breaks lineage and breaks time, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=205.88s)]
*  how do you reconstruct yourself? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  How do you reconstruct yourself in a way that is truthful, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=213.22s)]
*  reflects your ethics, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=218.45999999999998s)]
*  tell the stories that you really feel like [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=220.72s)]
*  embody your sense of justice? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=224.82s)]
*  I think there was great temptation [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  when you suffered through an experience like we have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  and the humiliation that comes with it [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=231.76s)]
*  to go completely in the other direction [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=234.42s)]
*  and maybe ignore some of the reality [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=237.5s)]
*  that actually makes you a human being. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=239.6s)]
*  Senegal, Dakar was really my opportunity [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=242.16s)]
*  to confront some of those stories [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=246.3s)]
*  and some of those ideas that actually I was raised on myself [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=248.14s)]
*  that embodied in my very name, actually. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=250.88s)]
*  In story, I guess, as you would say, in story. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=253.14s)]
*  They were embodied in story, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=256.38s)]
*  and that story kind of infiltrated you [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=257.68s)]
*  in ways that you perhaps were not really aware of. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=260.03999999999996s)]
*  So then, May of 2023, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=264.23999999999995s)]
*  you visited Israel and the Palestinian territories. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  So in the book, you draw parallels [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=269.18s)]
*  between Jim Crow America [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=272.06s)]
*  and the Israeli occupation of these territories. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  You called it separate and unequal, alive and well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=276.85999999999996s)]
*  You say it's a place where the glare of racism [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  burned more intensely than anywhere else in your life [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  that you had ever seen. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=285.94s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about why you say that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  There are two sides to me. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=292.21999999999997s)]
*  While there's a part of me that does not like mixing it up [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=293.06s)]
*  and fighting with people, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=296.52s)]
*  there is also a part of me that says [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  there is something dishonorable and actually unloving [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=303.5s)]
*  about witnessing certain things that you think are important [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=307.9s)]
*  and not saying anything about them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  The fact of the matter is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=314.44s)]
*  I went to the old city of Jerusalem on two different times. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=316.24s)]
*  The first time I went in the way [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=318.68s)]
*  that typically Palestinian Muslims go. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=320.08s)]
*  And we were held for about 45 minutes by armed guards [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=322.62s)]
*  before they gave us entrance. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=326.76s)]
*  There was no reason. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=329.28s)]
*  You went to Al Aqsa, the Al Aqsa Mosque. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=330.12s)]
*  And no reasoning was given or anything like that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=332.52s)]
*  They just held us just because they could. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=335.3s)]
*  And then when I came back, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=337.48s)]
*  in the way that an American tourist might come [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=338.44s)]
*  or a Christian typically might come, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=340.36s)]
*  it was so easy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=342.68s)]
*  I just breezed through. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=343.52s)]
*  It was the easiest thing in the world. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=344.64s)]
*  And this control of time and space [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=346.4s)]
*  extended out into the West Bank [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=348.28s)]
*  where there are roads for Palestinians [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=350.36s)]
*  and then there are roads for Israeli settlers, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  which immediately set off my child. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=353.94s)]
*  You got two different roads [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=355.84s)]
*  for two different classes of people. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=356.68s)]
*  So that immediately sets off alarm bells for me. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=358.4s)]
*  You're seeing in the territory [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=361.96s)]
*  and you can see one place where settlements are [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=363.96s)]
*  and where settlers live. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  And they're marked in a certain way. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  And then you can see other areas [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=369.34s)]
*  where they're Palestinian villages and hamlets [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=370.64s)]
*  and where they live. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=373.2s)]
*  You can see that these are completely separate. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=374.04s)]
*  You go to the old city of Hebron, as I've talked about, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=376.24s)]
*  and there's streets where I am allowed to walk down [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  if it is made clear to the guards [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=382.24s)]
*  that my mother was a Christian, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  that I am a Christian, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=385.36s)]
*  and that my grandmother was a Christian. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=386.20000000000005s)]
*  But my Palestinian guides do not have access to. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=387.72s)]
*  That's just in brief what I saw. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=391.46000000000004s)]
*  I saw much more. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  But that sets off certain things for me. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=396.66s)]
*  And then I came back and had to do the reading [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=399.04s)]
*  and the research on top of that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=400.92s)]
*  to understand the governance and the structures [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=402.52s)]
*  that are beneath that that make that possible [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=405.4s)]
*  and in some ways mandate that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=407.32s)]
*  And I was left with the conclusion [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=409.08s)]
*  that in fact what I was witnessing was separate and unequal. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  That it was the closest that I would see in my time [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=415.06s)]
*  to the Jim Crow that my parents were born into. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=417.74s)]
*  So is there a point at which you said to yourself, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=421.24s)]
*  I can not only just see this, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=425.02s)]
*  I have to write about it and accept whatever comes with [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=427.7s)]
*  my writing about it in this way. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=431.4s)]
*  Was there like a pivotal moment [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=433.12s)]
*  or was that always the plan? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=434.52s)]
*  That was always the plan, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=436.76s)]
*  but I knew by saying I'm gonna, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=437.67999999999995s)]
*  like I just knew this is gonna be hard. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=439.08s)]
*  This is gonna be wrong. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  And what's hard? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=443.2s)]
*  Say more about what's hard. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  What is hard? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=444.88s)]
*  I don't like hurting people's feelings, man. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=446.12s)]
*  I just, and that sounds, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=448.76s)]
*  I'm kind of laughing, but it's actually true. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=449.79999999999995s)]
*  I don't like, I don't enjoy telling people things, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=451.32s)]
*  telling people unpleasant things. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=454.26s)]
*  And to be really, I guess, direct with you, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=457.4s)]
*  there are people who I have had in my life [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=460.78s)]
*  who I care about, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=463.82s)]
*  some of whom have been colleagues of mine, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=466.47999999999996s)]
*  I've spent very intimate time around, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=468.65999999999997s)]
*  whose feelings this will hurt. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=472.7s)]
*  They have very, very different view of the state of Israel [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=474.61999999999995s)]
*  than I do have ties to it. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=477.78s)]
*  I believe that what I witnessed [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=480.58s)]
*  was an immoral apartheid regime. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=482.14s)]
*  That, those are my conclusions. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=484.53999999999996s)]
*  That's what I say in the book. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=486.11999999999995s)]
*  I don't take saying that lightly. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=488.62s)]
*  I would rather not feel like I have to say it, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=491.22s)]
*  but I did based on what I witnessed [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=493.94s)]
*  and what I read afterwards. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=496.88s)]
*  So your core conclusions are, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=498.42s)]
*  it's an apartheid regime. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=501.16s)]
*  The life there for Palestinians is unbearable. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=504.3s)]
*  It's unbearable, it's demeaning, it's dehumanizing, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=507.54s)]
*  and it's morally unjustifiable. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=510.42s)]
*  Would that be? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=512.98s)]
*  That would be correct. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=515.42s)]
*  That would be correct. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=516.54s)]
*  I wanna add two things to that. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=518.32s)]
*  The first thing is, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=519.96s)]
*  I know this word apartheid is harsh, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=521.12s)]
*  and it's one that- [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=523.28s)]
*  It's fraught. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=524.12s)]
*  Yeah, it attracts a lot of debate. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=524.94s)]
*  I don't want people to think that I'm just throwing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=526.16s)]
*  that around casually. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=528.32s)]
*  It was not just what I observed. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=530.32s)]
*  It was reading the reports of Amnesty International, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=532.3000000000001s)]
*  where they made the case for apartheid. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=536.2s)]
*  It was reading the reports of the human rights, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=537.8000000000001s)]
*  the Israeli human rights group, Bet-Solem, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=539.72s)]
*  where they made the case for apartheid. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=542.36s)]
*  It was reading Human Rights Watch and their reports. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=543.76s)]
*  It was reading the reports of Al Haq. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=547.68s)]
*  It was actually doing that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=548.68s)]
*  It was actually reading the words and the quotes of people [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=549.92s)]
*  like former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, or Ehud Omar, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=553.48s)]
*  and then warning that Israel was in fact [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=558.24s)]
*  tipping into apartheid. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=560.24s)]
*  That is really what it was rooted in. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=563.1999999999999s)]
*  So I know that is a heavy word for a lot of people, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=565.24s)]
*  but I don't want them to think that I'm just sort of [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=568.0799999999999s)]
*  casually lobbying grenades for the heck of it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=569.8s)]
*  So let me go into just some of the criticism [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=573.88s)]
*  of the work already. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=576.48s)]
*  The book is just out, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=577.3199999999999s)]
*  but a lot of people have already read it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=578.14s)]
*  Some of the criticism is you went for 10 days. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=580.0799999999999s)]
*  You went for 10 days. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=582.66s)]
*  This is a nation state that has existed in its current form [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=584.04s)]
*  for 75 years at this point, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=587.16s)]
*  but these are people who have indigenous claims [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  to this land for centuries. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=592.8s)]
*  You have two, not just the Palestinians [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=594.52s)]
*  have indigenous claims to this land, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=597.38s)]
*  but also the Hebrew people, the Jewish people, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=598.64s)]
*  have indigenous claims to this land, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=601.04s)]
*  and these borders have moved back and forth for centuries. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=602.8399999999999s)]
*  This is one of the things people often [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=606.68s)]
*  criticize journalists for. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=607.68s)]
*  They say, well, you go someplace for 10 days, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=608.68s)]
*  and then you're entitled to tell the world about it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=610.1999999999999s)]
*  So what do you say to that? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=612.52s)]
*  What I say to that is there are things [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  that we hold at our moral court, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=616.92s)]
*  and we witnessed that context, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=618.8s)]
*  600 word books, reports, even more time won't make okay. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=623.4s)]
*  There's nothing that I can imagine that I will see [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  that will make it okay that one group of people [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=636.76s)]
*  lives in a settlement and another group of people [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=641.24s)]
*  lives in a village, and there is perhaps [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=643.28s)]
*  a half a mile between those two group of people, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=645.4799999999999s)]
*  and one group has direct access to water [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=647.92s)]
*  and the other does not. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=650.04s)]
*  There's very little that I can imagine seeing, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=652.0s)]
*  there's nothing that I can imagine seeing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=654.7199999999999s)]
*  that allows for a society [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=656.8s)]
*  in which there are tears of citizenship, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=659.16s)]
*  and at the top tier of that is a group of people, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=661.08s)]
*  be they Jewish or whoever, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=663.8000000000001s)]
*  but in this case, because it's Israel. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=665.44s)]
*  They're Jewish who have the top tier of citizenship, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=668.4000000000001s)]
*  and everyone else is something less. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=670.96s)]
*  There's not something that I would have seen [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=674.48s)]
*  in 30 more days, and I will add that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  even that criticism is familiar to me, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=680.08s)]
*  because in fact, during the Civil Rights Movement, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=682.64s)]
*  what white southerners would often say is, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=685.6800000000001s)]
*  you white northerners who come down here [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=688.0400000000001s)]
*  and are stirring up trouble, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=689.88s)]
*  you don't know the Negro like we do. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=690.8s)]
*  You haven't been down here, you don't live down here, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=693.08s)]
*  you don't really know what it is. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=695.68s)]
*  You don't understand the situation. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=697.92s)]
*  You don't understand the situation, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=699.76s)]
*  but if you ask the black folks there, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=701.8s)]
*  they would tell you you understand it perfectly. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=703.08s)]
*  And so I just, I get it, I get that, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=706.64s)]
*  I would like to know more, I would like to do more, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=710.28s)]
*  but I can't help but feel that if I had [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=712.12s)]
*  a different political perspective on this, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=713.92s)]
*  the very people who are criticizing my just, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=716.64s)]
*  I'm only going there for 10 days, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=720.08s)]
*  we'd think 10 days were actually quite enough. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  The other criticism is you did not include in the book [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=724.72s)]
*  people who defend the government. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=729.24s)]
*  In fact, you criticize the idea of what we call, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  what we have started to call both siding the issue, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=736.72s)]
*  especially in journalism, but I still wanna ask you [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=740.0s)]
*  about your unwillingness to include, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=743.2s)]
*  for purposes of this report, other views, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=747.68s)]
*  because we are constantly being instructed, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  especially in this very polarized time, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=754.56s)]
*  that that's fundamental to empathy. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=757.4s)]
*  And if we don't at least engage in that practice, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=759.4399999999999s)]
*  that we're not being true to that fundamental value [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=762.4s)]
*  of trying to see other people as human. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=765.76s)]
*  So how do you answer that? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=767.2399999999999s)]
*  The first thing I would say is the pro-Israel point of view, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  the Zionist point of view, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=772.7199999999999s)]
*  those who view the Zionist project as a good thing, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=774.56s)]
*  as a moral thing, as a just thing, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=777.64s)]
*  they are not unrepresented in the vehicles [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=780.0s)]
*  of American media, in our newspapers, in our magazines, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=786.12s)]
*  in our television shows, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=788.92s)]
*  that viewpoint is not unrepresented. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=790.52s)]
*  On the contrary, it's one that I was very much exposed to. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=792.7199999999999s)]
*  And what the purpose of that last essay really is, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  is I am someone who went somewhere and saw something [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=800.0s)]
*  and came back struggling with how it could be [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=803.92s)]
*  that what I saw was so different [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=807.28s)]
*  than the story that I was consuming in my media [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=809.28s)]
*  on a regular basis. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=813.0s)]
*  And I really wanted to understand why. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=813.96s)]
*  And I thought that the way to do that, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  my tool for doing that, was to privilege the words [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=820.0s)]
*  of those who I believe have been unjustly pushed [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=823.6s)]
*  out of the frame, and that is the Palestinians. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=825.96s)]
*  My feeling is that many of the publications [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=830.4399999999999s)]
*  that would lodge that criticism would do well [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=833.68s)]
*  to look at their own bylines [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=836.8s)]
*  and count how many Palestinians they've published [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=838.4799999999999s)]
*  over the past 10 or 15 years. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=842.1999999999999s)]
*  And so it is quite rich to me that I am being criticized [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=845.3599999999999s)]
*  or that I would be criticized for not talking to people [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=849.7199999999999s)]
*  who would defend what I believe to be an unjust order, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=852.64s)]
*  in publications that I think are actually part [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=856.16s)]
*  of how that order maintains itself. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=858.8399999999999s)]
*  When you don't allow people to speak, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=861.44s)]
*  when you don't allow them a place, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=863.7600000000001s)]
*  not just in your individual work, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=866.2s)]
*  but in the entirety of the conversation, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=868.7600000000001s)]
*  it becomes a lot easier to do things to them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=870.8800000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm wondering if though, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=873.72s)]
*  is the fundamental problem here [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=879.4000000000001s)]
*  that one faith group is privileged over other faith groups? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=882.0s)]
*  Because that is not unique to Israel. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  Israel's not the only country that privileges [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=890.4s)]
*  one faith group over another faith group. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=893.12s)]
*  Is the fundamental problem here [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=895.68s)]
*  that Israel is seen as different, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=897.12s)]
*  that Israel sees itself as different? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=900.36s)]
*  I just wanna make sure I'm not excluding [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=902.68s)]
*  a very important group of people, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=904.04s)]
*  and that's Palestinian Christians, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  who I interviewed some of them [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=908.0799999999999s)]
*  and felt as discriminated against as anybody else. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=909.36s)]
*  There's an incident I described happening in Hebron [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=911.68s)]
*  where I'm asked my religion, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=914.56s)]
*  but you know what was very interesting about that? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=916.36s)]
*  I was also asked my mother's and my grandmother's religion. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=918.64s)]
*  And when you start asking that, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=921.36s)]
*  you are asking something besides, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=923.16s)]
*  do I accept Jesus Christ as my personal savior? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=925.48s)]
*  There's something deeper going on. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=928.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, there was great evil in this world, you know? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=930.24s)]
*  And I am wary of singling Israel out [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  as somehow singular or more evil or whatever. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=937.1999999999999s)]
*  But the point I would make is that [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=941.3199999999999s)]
*  I am responsible as an American, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=943.04s)]
*  and particularly as a citizen of a country [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=944.96s)]
*  that takes somebody like Martin Luther King [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=947.88s)]
*  as its patron saint, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=949.48s)]
*  that walks around talking about, you know, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=950.84s)]
*  with great pride about the triumphs [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=952.4s)]
*  of the civil rights movement and equality. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=953.76s)]
*  How can I then go to a country [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=956.52s)]
*  where we boast about our special relationship with [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=959.2s)]
*  and see a two-tiered society, literally, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=962.88s)]
*  where citizenship is decided by ethnicity, religion, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=965.5600000000001s)]
*  and rights are decided by ethnicity and religion, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=969.88s)]
*  and then just say, you know what, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=973.2800000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of other evil in the world too, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=974.48s)]
*  and turn my back. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=976.2800000000001s)]
*  I just don't have that in me to do that. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=977.36s)]
*  Before I let you go, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=979.84s)]
*  and I've been struggling to find this passage, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=980.6800000000001s)]
*  but this is when you were walking at Yad Vashem, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=982.24s)]
*  which is the memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=984.2800000000001s)]
*  You say that, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=987.84s)]
*  "'It hurts to know that in my own writing, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=989.2s)]
*  I have done to people that which in this writing [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=991.48s)]
*  I have invaded against, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=993.96s)]
*  that I have reduced people, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=995.2s)]
*  diminished people, erased people. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  I want to tell you that I was wrong. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=998.88s)]
*  I want to tell you that your oppression will not save you, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1000.76s)]
*  that being a victim will not enlighten you, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1003.5600000000001s)]
*  that it can just as easily deceive you.'" [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1005.92s)]
*  I learned that here in Haifa, in Ramallah, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1008.68s)]
*  and especially here at Yad Vashem. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1011.88s)]
*  So this is another story about writing, about power, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1013.88s)]
*  about settling accounts, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1017.64s)]
*  a story not of redemption, but of reparation. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1019.28s)]
*  Who are you talking to? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1023.92s)]
*  Myself. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1026.36s)]
*  But I was talking to my students. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1029.2s)]
*  I think that your imagination has to be slightly ahead, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1032.0s)]
*  and maybe even more ahead than the present politics. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1036.6s)]
*  And I think there is great, great danger in thinking [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1039.8s)]
*  that because you lack power in a particular moment, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1044.6s)]
*  you don't have the ability to hurt and damage other people. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1048.76s)]
*  I am not in that case making a narrow critique of Israel [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1054.08s)]
*  or Zionism. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1058.28s)]
*  This is, I think, a very, very human impulse [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1059.32s)]
*  to think that because you went through [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1062.04s)]
*  some horrific experience, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1063.64s)]
*  you therefore have a kind of moral authority [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1065.92s)]
*  and are therefore then not capable [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1069.48s)]
*  of inflicting horrors on other people. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1072.24s)]
*  And as much as I feel like I saw that, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1075.5600000000002s)]
*  you know what I mean, in my travels over there, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evcCjLM27Mo&t=1077.8000000000002s)]
