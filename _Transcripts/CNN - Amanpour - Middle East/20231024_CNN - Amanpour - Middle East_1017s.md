# How the Israel-Hamas War Could Impact the 2024 U.S. Elections | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y)
*  And as we've discussed, President Biden says it's not time for a ceasefire, sparking anger [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=0.0s)]
*  not only among some liberal Democrats in Congress, but also young Muslim and Arab American voters. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Votes from these communities in the swing state of Michigan were instrumental to Biden's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  2020 presidential win. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=15.56s)]
*  But senior Democratic strategist Walid Shahid tells Hari Sreenivasan that's at risk for [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=17.72s)]
*  2024, as this new war ignites politics and passions. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=22.64s)]
*  Christiane, thanks. Walid, Jahid, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=27.76s)]
*  We have seen protests in different cities around the country, and we even saw one in the Capitol. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=30.64s)]
*  There were lots of people who were sitting in in the Capitol building calling for a ceasefire. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Tell me, what are the organizations trying to raise awareness of and accomplish? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=42.84s)]
*  Yeah, the coalition calling for ceasefire as a multi-faith, multiracial coalition made up of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  people of all backgrounds. We are an anti-war, pro-peace coalition. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=55.28s)]
*  We believe Israelis and Palestinians deserve peace and we want to see an end to the violence. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=58.92s)]
*  We believe that more bombs and more bloodshed will lead to more bombs and more bloodshed. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  So we're calling on President Biden and Congress to push for a ceasefire and hold our ally [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=68.56s)]
*  in Israel accountable for atrocities that the Israeli government has committed against [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=74.48s)]
*  Palestinian civilians and also call on Hamas to release the Israeli hostages. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=80.28s)]
*  President Biden has had leadership to resolve some of the worst armed conflicts and worst occupations [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=84.16s)]
*  in our world history, and he used diplomatic leverage and political pressure on our allies [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=90.72s)]
*  in South Africa and in England and in Ireland to bring the parties together, put an end to the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=97.84s)]
*  violence, and address the political grievances of the parties involved. And that is the same [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=102.96s)]
*  sort of method he should be using today rather than allying with a far-right regime in Israel [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=107.52s)]
*  that is hell-bent on vengeance and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=112.8s)]
*  What's the response been from the White House? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  The response has been pretty disappointing. I mean, we have a president in his address who [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  essentially is green-lighting Netanyahu's far-right government's attacks against Palestinian [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=126.96s)]
*  civilians. The Israeli government is led by a far-right coalition that holds Palestinians [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=133.68s)]
*  collectively responsible for the atrocities committed by Hamas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=139.76s)]
*  I just don't see a plan from this White House. This White House is acting like as if we are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=144.88s)]
*  in a world from 10 or 15 years ago in which Arab Americans and Muslim Americans and young people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=150.64s)]
*  are just going to sit back and support a president and support a party that green-lights someone who [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  believes that Gaza, green-lights someone in Israel who believes Gaza should be burned to the ground, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=162.16s)]
*  who doesn't believe in a two-state solution, who doesn't believe that Palestinians are equal [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=167.12s)]
*  in the eyes of the government as Israelis. And so we're severely disappointed from the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  response from the White House. And we will keep pushing to get members of Congress to call on [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=177.12s)]
*  President Biden to push for peace and not war. There were several progressive and further left [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=181.04s)]
*  groups within hours of the attack on Hamas. They were publicizing efforts and marches and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=188.56s)]
*  protests in support of Palestine without any mention of the civilian loss of life on Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  Were you concerned when you saw those statements? And were there efforts to try to push back and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=206.56s)]
*  say, well, we can't be this way? The things said at some of these fringe rallies and fringe [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=212.64s)]
*  activist groups about condoning Hamas or thinking Hamas is legitimate resistance are absolutely [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=219.76s)]
*  horrendous. The thing I will say is there is not a single member of Congress or any elected official [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=224.64s)]
*  in government who stands by any of those things that any of those activists said in the first [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  couple days of this rally. You can't find a single member of Congress who doesn't mourn the lives of [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  Israeli civilians. But you can find hundreds of members of Congress who have said nothing about [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=242.4s)]
*  the loss of Palestinian casualties, Palestinian civilians. And that is the fairness and the bias [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=248.16s)]
*  that our government has toward treating Israeli lives as if they are more valuable and more [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=256.96s)]
*  precious than Palestinian lives to me is utterly disgraceful as a Democrat and as an American. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=262.88s)]
*  We condemn all the progressive members of Congress have condemned anyone who has said anything [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=268.0s)]
*  supportive of Hamas in the past few days. You can't find a statement defending Hamas from [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=272.88s)]
*  an elected official. But Lindsey Graham has said we should burn that we're in a religious war and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=278.32s)]
*  we should tear the place apart. Max Miller said we should turn Gaza into a parking lot. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=282.72s)]
*  Far right Israeli officials have said there is no such thing as a Palestinian. Far right officials [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=289.28s)]
*  in the government. So we have dehumanizing, genocidal rhetoric from American politicians, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=293.28s)]
*  Israeli politicians, people with power. These aren't 19-year-old college students. These are [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=297.84s)]
*  government officials who have access to funding, to bombs, to the highest levers of government. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=302.96s)]
*  And that's why I think a lot of progressives and a lot of activists are frustrated is that we are [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=308.32s)]
*  held to account for dumb things, hurtful things said at rallies. But none of these politicians [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  with actual power are being held responsible for things they're saying about Palestinians. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  Do you think when it comes to the activists that are on college campuses that the pressure [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=323.44s)]
*  from, for example, more progressive groups on the shortcomings of the Biden administration and the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=330.32s)]
*  critiques that you've articulated are going to lead more Muslim Americans to set out the election [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=338.64s)]
*  cycle and the alternative is a president who, a former president and perhaps a future president [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=347.76s)]
*  who wants to expand a Muslim ban? Yeah, so on the Friday rally, which was a Friday prayer service [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  on the Washington Mall, I talked to dozens of Muslim and Arab Americans, many of whom [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=364.0s)]
*  are lifelong Democrats, have voted Democrat in every election, voted for President Biden. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=368.64s)]
*  And nearly all of them said they cannot bring themselves from an ethical or moral standpoint [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=373.92s)]
*  to vote for a president who supports a far-right leader in Israel who doesn't believe Palestinians [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  are human beings, doesn't believe they should be treated equally as Israelis. And that really [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=385.68s)]
*  scares me. I don't think any of these voters are going to vote for Trump. I think they're going to [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=391.44s)]
*  sit out the election just like many people sat out 2016. I think they are also could potentially [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=394.96s)]
*  vote for a third party candidate like Cornel West, who does have daylight. There is a lot of [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=401.2s)]
*  daylight between President Biden and Cornel West on this issue. And if Cornel West makes the ballot [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=406.0s)]
*  somehow in Michigan or Georgia, wins one or two percent, you can say that that state belongs to [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=410.08s)]
*  Trump. I don't support that. I don't want Trump in the White House, but that is the feeling I'm [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  seeing across as a Democrat strategist, as someone who supports the party, as a member of the party. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=420.48s)]
*  That's the trend I'm seeing across the country. Lifelong Democrats are saying they don't think [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=424.4s)]
*  the party sees them as human beings. And so I really urge President Biden and Democratic [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=429.44s)]
*  advisors around him to take seriously that the only way you can win Michigan in the statewide [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=438.48s)]
*  election is by holding on to the Arab and Muslim American vote. That also is true of Georgia. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=443.92s)]
*  And people are not seeing themselves being treated with humanity because of people with names like [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=449.44s)]
*  theirs, faces like theirs in Gaza are being bombed indiscriminately through [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=455.12s)]
*  bombs that are being funded by this president. Last week, he made an address to the nation where [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to get his quotes right. It says the U.S. remains committed to the Palestinian people's [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=466.32s)]
*  right to dignity and to self-determination and that he is, quote, heartbroken by the tragic [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=471.36s)]
*  loss of Palestinian life. I mean, he did negotiate the first shipments of aid to get into Gaza and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=475.76s)]
*  announced that the U.S. is providing about a hundred million dollars in humanitarian [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  assistance. Is this not what we would expect a president to do? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=486.8s)]
*  I am sure the people in Gaza are thankful for the bandages and humanitarian aid that they're [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=493.76s)]
*  being provided by in part because of President Biden. And I think what they want most is for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  the bombs to stop dropping on them so that bandages aren't necessary. Look, this conflict [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=506.48s)]
*  is escalating and President Biden has no plan to deescalate the situation. Iran has threatened to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=512.48s)]
*  also get involved. We are moving toward a situation that is going to get into another escalated [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=518.08s)]
*  Middle Eastern conflict that Americans do not support. In response to Russia's brutal invasion [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=524.08s)]
*  of Ukraine, the U.S. worked to get countries around the world to join the U.S. and the EU [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=530.24s)]
*  to sanction Russia. But many countries in the global south refused, feeling that the U.S. and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=535.76s)]
*  the EU had self-interest and has ignored and exacerbated several atrocities around the world [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=540.4s)]
*  that are similar to what Russia has committed against Ukraine. The U.S. said they were defending [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=546.64s)]
*  the rules-based international order, but many countries in the global south felt that the U.S. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  and Europe were pursuing their own narrow self-interest. So when the U.S. provides $14 [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=556.24s)]
*  billion of unconditional military aid to a far-right government Israel that does not believe in [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=560.16s)]
*  a two-state solution, they openly declare their intent to commit war crimes. How is that a [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=565.6s)]
*  rules-based international order? Basically, the way it feels to much of the global south is the [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  U.S. stands for peace and human rights when it suits our interests, but then turns a blind eye [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  when our ally does the exact same. So I think this from an international perspective, I don't think [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=582.32s)]
*  everything President Biden has tried to do to reset the clock when it comes to the horrible [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=587.76s)]
*  things Trump did to ruin America's image abroad. This conflict is going to do the exact same thing [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=593.04s)]
*  that all the things that Trump did to make America's image horrible in the eyes of the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=599.36s)]
*  world. This is a very similar scale where it feels like the U.S. stands with peace when it [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=605.68s)]
*  suits our interest only and not when it involves another situation. You had a state department [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=612.8s)]
*  official last week, Josh Paul, resign over our support for Israel. We had I think 411 members of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=619.28s)]
*  Capitol Hill staff, both Jewish and Muslim, sign a letter basically demanding an immediate [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=628.4s)]
*  ceasefire in Gaza. Do you think that, do you hear from, are these actions effective? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=635.1999999999999s)]
*  I think they're very effective and if you are a government official watching this, you are the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=643.4399999999999s)]
*  main reason why President Biden has even said a word to Netanyahu to demand humanitarian aid. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=648.56s)]
*  The people in the White House and the people in Congress, the staffers who are standing up and [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=654.88s)]
*  saying enough is enough is the main reason why we're moving this forward. But I will say, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  I am very concerned that my Democratic Party leadership has its head in the sand when it [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=664.4s)]
*  comes to the 2024 election. The path to the White House runs through Michigan and Michigan runs [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=670.0799999999999s)]
*  through Dearborn and Detroit, which are the two of the largest Arab American and Muslim American [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=675.92s)]
*  cities in the country. And just on Friday, Representative Debbie Dingell, who's not, Debbie [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=680.8s)]
*  Dingell who's not a leftist, who's not a major progressive, said she's all, she's represented [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=685.68s)]
*  that community for years and she said she's concerned about the 2024 election. I know how [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=690.4799999999999s)]
*  important it is to defeat Trump as a Muslim American, as a Democratic strategist, but the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=695.8399999999999s)]
*  blank check of violence our president is providing, Bibi Netanyahu, Muslim Americans oppose it, Arab [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=699.68s)]
*  Americans oppose it, young people oppose it. And so Michigan, just like there was low Democratic [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=706.0799999999999s)]
*  turnout for Hillary Clinton in 2016, what I am seeing is there will be low Democratic turnout [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=711.12s)]
*  for Joe Biden in 2024 in the same state where that Hillary lost. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=716.56s)]
*  Is there a generational gap here in, I mean, it seems President Biden is from a different era [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  of politics where the actions that he's taking, the approaches that he's taking are probably [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=728.48s)]
*  consistent with the way the Congress functioned, the way that governments functioned with each [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=736.48s)]
*  other for the majority of his life, right? And you see maybe a different generation of not just [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  politicians, but the electorate who have a different set of expectations, like the ones [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=749.92s)]
*  that you're articulating. I think that's a big part of it. Look, but it's also a pre-9-11 thing [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=755.68s)]
*  when it came to Ronald Reagan, people forget this, but Ronald Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=761.76s)]
*  Bill Clinton held the Israeli government way more accountable than anyone post-9-11 did. I think [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=769.04s)]
*  there's been this fear and culture of Islamophobia that has pervaded since 9-11 where we cannot treat [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=775.12s)]
*  the Palestinian people and their authorities in the West Bank, the Palestinian authority, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=780.88s)]
*  with equal footing as the Israelis. On the voter level, there's absolutely a generational thing. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=786.4s)]
*  As this millennial generation that opposed the Iraq war in 2003 comes to political age, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=791.36s)]
*  comes to voting age, the Democratic Party is fundamentally different than it was 15 years [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=796.64s)]
*  ago. And I think President Biden, his chief of staff, the advisors around him are thinking [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=802.24s)]
*  about this Democratic Party as if it was from 15 years ago. But look, Arab and Muslim Americans [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=806.8s)]
*  are now civically engaged, are politically engaged. We didn't have a Rashida Tlaib 15 years ago. We [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=812.4799999999999s)]
*  didn't have an Ilhan Omar. And having those political representatives, having that political [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  voice makes more people more courageous to step out, more courageous to protest. I remember after [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  9-11, so many Muslim families, even though they were experiencing hate crimes or bigotry, were [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=827.28s)]
*  afraid to speak out. Were afraid to protest. Were afraid to rally because of the chilling culture [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=832.96s)]
*  because of the Patriot Act. Now you have a new generation, many of whom were born in this country, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=838.64s)]
*  who are inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, are inspired by the Black Lives Matter Movement, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=844.0s)]
*  and are saying, no, I am an American. I deserve my voice to be heard. And I am going to protest my [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=848.72s)]
*  government. And I'm not going to be afraid. And I think that that is the reason you're seeing so [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=854.4000000000001s)]
*  many people, thousands of Jews, thousands of Arabs, thousands of Muslim, thousands of young people [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=858.56s)]
*  oppose this. The vast majority of voters under 45 do not support sending Israel more weapons without [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=863.92s)]
*  any strings attached to address the political grievances of the Palestinian people. And [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=870.88s)]
*  if that doesn't happen, you can say goodbye to Michigan. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  And you had 13 Democratic members of Congress introduce a resolution to call for a ceasefire, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  whether or not that is allowed to get to a full vote, etc. How does this rift end up manifesting? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=887.04s)]
*  I think this will be a deep rift going forward. You know, many people have reached out to me and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=897.36s)]
*  said, you know, Waleed, like a year from now, who knows what happens, but people will remember that [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=901.12s)]
*  this president took five days to call the family of Wadi El Iqbal. People remember that the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=906.0799999999999s)]
*  members of Congress held a bipartisan vigil for mourning only Israeli civilian deaths and not [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=912.96s)]
*  Palestinian deaths. This comes back to the fundamental point. Are Palestinian lives equal [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=919.68s)]
*  to Israeli lives in the eyes of our government? And until that question is addressed, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=926.16s)]
*  you will continue to see this rift deepen on the elected level, on the staff level, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=931.2s)]
*  on the voter level. Morale is as you've seen resignations, as you've seen letters [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=935.36s)]
*  across government bodies in this country, morale is incredibly low if you work in government right [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=940.4s)]
*  now. And that will continue to deepen unless people feel like they are treated with equal respect, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=947.12s)]
*  equal humanity as Jewish Americans, as Jewish Israelis, who also deserve dignity and respect [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=952.88s)]
*  and humanity. But I have so many people in my life who are Democratic strategists, progressive [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=959.36s)]
*  strategists, government officials, who feel sick to their stomach showing up to work because they're [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=964.48s)]
*  being silenced, they're not being treated equally, they're being kicked out of rooms, they're not [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=969.04s)]
*  being allowed to attend meetings, they're being told they're Hamas sympathizers that because [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=972.8s)]
*  they're Muslim, they don't see or they're Arab, they can't see this correctly. And you know, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=976.7199999999999s)]
*  this is what I mean, like 15 years ago, we didn't have this level of Muslim American or Arab Americans [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  in government offices as much as we do now. And so I just think the Democratic Party has fundamentally [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=987.8399999999999s)]
*  shifted. But I don't think President Biden's thinking about the party has shifted. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=993.36s)]
*  Democratic strategist Waleed Shaheed, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=998.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CukAAYNE4Y&t=1001.28s)]
