Video Description: Amid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, there is no sign of change in the U.S. government's support for Israel. America is sending a powerful anti-missile system to Israel and 100 troops to operate it. But pressure is building on President Biden to end the war and with just three weeks to go until the U.S. election, anxiety is high among Democrats as the race remains locked in a dead heat. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi joins Christiane to discuss her new book "The Art of Power," and the election, which she sees as a call to save democracy.

# Nancy Pelosi: “I Don’t Know if Netanyahu Is Capable of Peace” | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I)
*  Speaker Pelosi, welcome back to our program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=0.0s)]
*  Wonderful to be here. Thank you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=2.36s)]
*  Let me ask you first before we get to your book about current affairs. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=3.88s)]
*  We've just had this terrible report about the Israeli strikes on Gaza and Lebanon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=7.44s)]
*  Now, as they continue their counteroffensives, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=14.32s)]
*  we've seen an attack on UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=17.76s)]
*  and we've seen over the weekend some pretty dire attacks on refugee camp, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=22.48s)]
*  on various areas that dozens have been killed, including children. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=28.12s)]
*  I just wonder your response to that, given America is the most important ally. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=32.96s)]
*  Well, the fact is that we just a few days ago observed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=38.44s)]
*  one year anniversary of a terrible assault on Israel by Hamas, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=43.08s)]
*  a terrorist group dedicated to the destruction of Israel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=47.36s)]
*  Sadly, since then, we've seen many casualties of non-combatants, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=51.56s)]
*  children and families in Gaza and now some elsewhere in the region. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  And it's just intolerable. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=63.4s)]
*  We cannot... [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=66.39999999999999s)]
*  War has to be outlawed as a resolution of any conflict or disagreement. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=68.44s)]
*  But right now, we have to live with the circumstances that we have. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=75.32s)]
*  We've all been talking about a two-state solution for a long time [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  for Israel and for the Palestinians. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=84.2s)]
*  The current leader in Israel does not agree to that, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=87.76s)]
*  even though for about 30 years, since like 93, we have been talking about that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=91.84s)]
*  I don't know if Netanyahu wants peace. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=99.84s)]
*  I don't know if he's capable of peace. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he's afraid of peace. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  But he has gone off the course that we all thought we were in as we support Israel. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  He actually came to the Congress not so long ago. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=113.04s)]
*  What did you make of that invitation [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=116.76s)]
*  and the way he spoke against your party and your administration? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=119.64s)]
*  Well, it wasn't his first time to do that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  He came before. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  The invitation was misrepresented. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=127.44s)]
*  It wasn't bipartisan, but the speaker said it was. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  And so he showed up and spoke against President Obama, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  whose masterful, virtuoso initiative for the Iran nuclear agreement was remarkable. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=139.0s)]
*  He came and spoke against our president and our Congress. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  It was terrible. It was disgraceful. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=153.56s)]
*  This speech that he made recently, I thought, was the worst presentation ever made [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  by a leader of a country invited to speak before the Congress. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=162.83999999999997s)]
*  I was against the invitation, but I'm not the speaker anymore. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=167.88s)]
*  And of course, I did not attend, but I did observe what he had to say. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=172.04s)]
*  It was most unfortunate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=178.6s)]
*  But we all support Israel. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  It is in our national interest, our security interest to do so, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=182.44s)]
*  our values interest to do so over time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=187.24s)]
*  But right now, the leverage that we have given Netanyahu [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=190.68s)]
*  has been used in a way that is most destructive. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=195.32s)]
*  Would you say right now, and we speak in the context of an election, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=198.2s)]
*  that all foreign powers and leaders are watching very closely, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=201.4s)]
*  not only yourselves in the United States, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  would you say right now America should be using its leverage? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  And if so, what is that leverage? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=210.6s)]
*  Well, our support for Israel has always been bipartisan. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=212.2s)]
*  And we want it to continue to be so in the Congress, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=216.2s)]
*  in the House, the Senate, the White House, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=219.4s)]
*  as well as among the American people. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=221.72s)]
*  But it does not give license to so many people dying, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=224.28s)]
*  not combatants, as I said, in the war. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=231.08s)]
*  So we have to, again, try to strive to bring it to a two-state solution. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=234.44s)]
*  I emphasize the word solution because I've said that to Netanyahu. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=240.68s)]
*  It's not just a two-state situation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=244.68s)]
*  It's a solution, one that really works out the security, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=247.4s)]
*  the prosperity, the freedom for the Palestinian people, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=251.08s)]
*  as well as the security of the Israelis. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=255.0s)]
*  And given that there's an election, are you concerned [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=258.12s)]
*  by the very, very difficult polling for Kamala Harris, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=261.4s)]
*  particularly regarding Arab Americans, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=265.32s)]
*  particularly in the swing state of Michigan? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=267.48s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it is something to be considered. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=269.4s)]
*  When we talk about this subject, people forget. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=271.72s)]
*  They forget a Muslim ban instituted by this president. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=274.6s)]
*  One of the first things he did... [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=278.44s)]
*  By President Donald Trump. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=279.48s)]
*  By Donald Trump, one of the first things he did in his presidency [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=280.92s)]
*  was to have a Muslim ban. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=285.08000000000004s)]
*  Democrats flocked to their protection, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=286.68s)]
*  and yet this is what Donald Trump did. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=289.88s)]
*  And now, because of this situation, which again, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=293.40000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden has been a friend of Israel, that's for sure, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=299.48s)]
*  but he's also been a friend of the Palestinians. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=302.6s)]
*  And even before October 7th, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=305.40000000000003s)]
*  when we were meeting our September 30th deadline for the budget, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  I was going to the Republicans and asking for humanitarian assistance [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=313.48s)]
*  for refugees. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=319.16s)]
*  They said, we'll give you that as long as it's not used for the Palestinians. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=320.76s)]
*  So the fact that she would be paying a price [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=324.76s)]
*  is for policies that were very pro-Palestinian is really sad. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=329.32s)]
*  But death is sad, and that is being reflected. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=336.04s)]
*  I'm not sure it's all spontaneous. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=341.48s)]
*  Some of it is. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=344.76000000000005s)]
*  It's spontaneous, it's grassroots, it's truly that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=345.72s)]
*  I think some of it is motivated for other reasons. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKge9dXX_-I&t=348.84000000000003s)]
