Video Description: The crisis across America’s campuses is causing some controversy over the current definition of antisemitism, as written by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. It’s a definition which has been adopted by countries across the globe. Author Kenneth Stern led the drafting of that document, and he joins the show with a warning that it’s being used to stifle free speech.

# He Helped Define “Antisemitism”; Now He Says the Term Is Being Weaponized | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488)
*  And as we mentioned earlier, the crisis across America's campuses is making some wrestle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=0.0s)]
*  with the current definition of anti-Semitism, as written by the International Holocaust [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=5.36s)]
*  Remembrance Alliance. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=9.92s)]
*  It's a definition which has been adopted by countries across the globe. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=10.92s)]
*  Next, Michelle Martin speaks to the author Kenneth Stern, who led the drafting of that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=15.16s)]
*  document and who now warns it's being used to chill free speech. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=19.96s)]
*  Thanks, Christiane. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=24.28s)]
*  Kenneth Stern, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=26.28s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=28.92s)]
*  Now, I just want to mention that you have a distinguished career as a trial lawyer, as [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=29.92s)]
*  an author, as a human rights activist. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  But what I think a lot of people might know about you is that you were the lead drafter [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of anti-Semitism. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  And we're going to talk a little bit about the way you feel this definition has been [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=46.84s)]
*  used and perhaps misused. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=50.64s)]
*  But I just wanted to ask you to start us off by telling us why you drafted this to begin [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=53.160000000000004s)]
*  with. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=57.32000000000001s)]
*  What's the origin story of this? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=58.36s)]
*  Well, the origin story is that after the beginning of the Second Intifada and the collapse of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=59.96s)]
*  the peace process in 2000, there was an uptick in attacks on Jews, particularly in Europe [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=64.8s)]
*  and the United States, too, but mostly in Europe. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=71.4s)]
*  And there was a group called the European Monitoring Center that was tasked with doing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=74.04s)]
*  reports about racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=79.08s)]
*  And it put out a report in the end of 2004 that found, in fact, that some of the attacks [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  were by not only the traditional suspects, white supremacists and others, but also by [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=91.12s)]
*  young Arab and Muslim folks in some outskirts of Paris and other places like that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  So the data was right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=101.12s)]
*  But they said, we have a problem in that we have all these different countries that have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  people that are collecting information and no common score sheet, no common definition [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=108.0s)]
*  of what to look at. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=112.4s)]
*  And then they also said, well, we're going to have a temporary definition that's going [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=114.48s)]
*  to look at issues of anti-Semitism based on stereotypes about Jews. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=118.92s)]
*  And they went through that exercise and said, what do we do if a Jew is attacked on the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=123.68s)]
*  streets of a European city as a stand in for an Israeli? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  And they said, if somebody had these stereotypes and applied them to Israelis and reapplied [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=133.36s)]
*  them to Jews, that was that was anti-Semitism, but not if they were upset with Israeli policy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  They said that's lamentable, but should not be counted. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  And that struck me as nuts, basically, because I grew up at the time of the civil rights [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=146.52s)]
*  movement and I can't imagine somebody saying, well, lynching some black person is racist [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=151.08s)]
*  if they have these stereotypes about black people, but not if they were upset by a political [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=156.8s)]
*  event, Martin Luther King's speech. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=160.56s)]
*  So it just so happened that the director of the European Monitoring Center was invited [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=163.0s)]
*  by a colleague to come to the American Jewish Committee, where I worked for its annual [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=169.76s)]
*  meeting to talk broadly with others about what was happening in Europe. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=174.28s)]
*  And as we saw then, as we see now, there's some discourse about Israel that's correlated [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=178.0s)]
*  with attacks on Jews, not necessarily causation, but we thought it was important to take the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=183.64s)]
*  temperature. There were other reasons for the definition, too, but that's how it started. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=188.04s)]
*  That's why there are Israel examples inside the definition. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=192.0s)]
*  I wanted to talk about the op-ed you wrote for the Boston Globe a few weeks ago. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=195.04000000000002s)]
*  You say that the term is now being used. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=198.8s)]
*  It's now being weaponized, actually, to muzzle free speech on campus. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=202.08s)]
*  Could you just explain how the term or the framework that you wrote is now being [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  weaponized and why you find that dangerous? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, the the language of the definition was being started to be used in Title Six [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  cases after 2010. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=221.2s)]
*  And it was looking at issues like what a professor was teaching, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  what speakers were coming into campus, what texts were being assigned, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=230.92s)]
*  things that clearly are the heart of academic freedom. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  And my concern is that the pushing of this, especially on Title Six cases, I'm not [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=241.32s)]
*  particularly worried about the cases themselves, although I am worried about how [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=247.48s)]
*  some of them are going to be litigated. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=251.92s)]
*  The pressure is on administrators when they know that people are poised to sue [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=253.72s)]
*  when certain speech is happening on a campus that may trigger somebody to file a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=260.8s)]
*  Title Six case. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=266.76s)]
*  They're more likely to try to suppress that speech or counter that speech, because [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=269.08s)]
*  part of what they do in their day job is to protect the university from being sued. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=274.88s)]
*  So I see it as not only just the question of the legal question, I see it as [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=279.52s)]
*  intentionally trying to create a chilling effect. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  And I don't think that's appropriate. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  Counterspeech with other speech, you don't use instruments of law to suppress speech. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's how I see it's being used. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  And it's also becoming a symbol in a way that's really troubling to me, too, about [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=294.67999999999995s)]
*  being concerned about anti-Semitism, which is the work I've been doing for decades. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=299.4s)]
*  Once we try to reduce things into is this anti-Semitism or not, we're losing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=304.84s)]
*  focus on so many things about how anti-Semitism works in the real world. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=311.4s)]
*  We'd all consider the Tria Live shooting clearly anti-Semitic, but the shooter at [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=315.96s)]
*  the Wal-Mart in El Paso a few months later had the same ideology, was worried about [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  the fevered pitch about immigrants destroying our country. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=325.4s)]
*  We look at one as anti-Semitism. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=328.55999999999995s)]
*  We don't look at the other as anti-Semitism. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=330.2s)]
*  What I when I talk to synagogues and I say we're just concerned about anti-Semitism. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=332.88s)]
*  What concerns me most is not necessarily what people are saying about Jews. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  It's what politicians and others are saying about anyone among us as a danger, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=344.56s)]
*  whether it's immigrants or Muslims or others, because once you prime that pump, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=350.6s)]
*  that inevitably leads to people getting into these buckets of thinking that are [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=355.32s)]
*  sort of conveyor belts to conspiracy theories. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=361.6s)]
*  On top of that, I worked the American Jewish Committee for 25 years. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=364.0s)]
*  I jealously guarded the term anti-Semitism. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=367.56s)]
*  To have a sting, it has to be used only in the clearest cases. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=371.32s)]
*  So I'd always default to not. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=375.52000000000004s)]
*  Now there's a push to make it almost ubiquitous. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=377.32s)]
*  And when everything becomes anti-Semitic, nothing is anti-Semitic. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=380.64s)]
*  And that makes it harder to fight anti-Semitism. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=383.6s)]
*  You know, look, I take your point. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=386.04s)]
*  Look, if everything's anti-Semitism, then nothing is anti-Semitism. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=387.12s)]
*  But having said that, does the framework still have utility? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  Like, is there is there still a need for this or is that or has it gone so far [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=395.68s)]
*  than in its misuse that it no longer has utility? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=401.88s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, there are various definitions of anti-Semitism. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=406.24s)]
*  Some of them are better for one purpose or another. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  Some of them are more likely to be used to stop pro-Palestinian speech, at least [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=411.64s)]
*  abused, which is how I see the, you know, the IRED definition being engaged. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=415.72s)]
*  But, you know, all of them have as a core, the basic idea that anti-Semitism [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  is conspiracy theory about Jews harming humanity and, you know, giving an [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=427.16s)]
*  explanation of what goes wrong in the world. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=432.68s)]
*  But again, I don't want the shortcuts to be used to look at speech. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=434.92s)]
*  And the parallel I look at is imagine if one had put together a definition [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=439.76s)]
*  of racism that would also take into account some political things that may [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=445.32s)]
*  affect racism, not to say if you say these things are inherently racist, but [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=448.92s)]
*  they may be appropriate things to consider. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=453.36s)]
*  So opposition to Black Lives Matter, opposition to removal of Confederate [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=455.36s)]
*  statues, opposition to affirmative action, then you can make the argument [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=460.96s)]
*  those things might be in dishes of the temperature of racism to put into [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=464.52s)]
*  surveys and so forth. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=471.08s)]
*  Would you want to then have a hate speech code in effect, let alone endorsed [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=473.44s)]
*  by Congress that says one has this particular view on any of these issues, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=480.0s)]
*  they're there for expressing racism? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=484.20000000000005s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=486.56s)]
*  And you'd see the damage that that would do to the ability to even look at these [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=487.36s)]
*  things on a college campus. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=491.8s)]
*  And those are the same concerns I have about the use of these definitions in [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=493.08000000000004s)]
*  this context. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=497.40000000000003s)]
*  This is kind of exactly the issue that we see at play now as these [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=498.24s)]
*  demonstrations on college campuses have spread really across the country. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=502.6s)]
*  And I just this is sort of the argument that we are being told that this is [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=509.24s)]
*  between an argument between free speech and student safety. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=513.32s)]
*  Do you see it that way? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=518.2s)]
*  Literally a complicated issue, but I see the students should be safe from [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=519.6s)]
*  harassment, from intimidation, from bullying, from discrimination, regardless [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=525.64s)]
*  of whether they fit into one of the classifications legally, any student [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=531.92s)]
*  should be protected from those things. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=536.12s)]
*  But students should be prepared and the university should stress that students [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  are going to hear things that they find disturbing. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=542.92s)]
*  I hear a lot of the chance and things disturbing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=544.48s)]
*  But if they're not being made as part of a threat, just a question of expression, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=548.12s)]
*  that has to be protected. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=553.24s)]
*  Part of the background to what we're seeing now was the push to outlaw Students [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=554.8s)]
*  for Justice in Palestine because of what they're saying. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=559.88s)]
*  And I disagree with a lot of what they're saying, but I don't want them banned. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=562.92s)]
*  DeSantis did that in Florida, Brandeis did that, not based on anything they did, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=566.4s)]
*  just in terms of what they were saying. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=570.8s)]
*  And so that's part of the reason why I think we're seeing some of the uptick now [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=572.76s)]
*  in the response is that there's been a lack of clarity. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=577.12s)]
*  We're not, you know, we're going to support your right to say things that we [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=581.84s)]
*  find offensive. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  We're going to use the assets of the institution to teach about it, but we're [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=587.2s)]
*  not going to suspend you or discipline you for things that you say. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=591.08s)]
*  What is the line? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=595.64s)]
*  Because obviously some speech is already criminal conduct. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=597.0s)]
*  If a person threatens to kill you, right, you can make a credible threat to kill [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  somebody, you can be arrested for that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=605.48s)]
*  That's already a crime. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=608.24s)]
*  So where do you feel like the universities have kind of gone off the rails? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=610.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if somebody makes a specific threat to a person, I'm going to kill you. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=614.6s)]
*  And it's a direct, immediate threat. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=619.88s)]
*  That's obviously a problem. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=621.8s)]
*  There was a case a number of years ago where in California, somebody found the names [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=622.92s)]
*  of everybody that sounded like an Asian student, Asian-American student, and put [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=628.4s)]
*  out an email to all of them saying, I'm going to make it my mission in life to hunt [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=633.8s)]
*  you down and kill you or something. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=637.04s)]
*  He got convicted appropriately. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=638.5200000000001s)]
*  So, but if I just stand up and say something deplorable about about Zionist or [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=640.0400000000001s)]
*  Israelis or any group, that's nothing more than speech that should be countered, but [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=646.96s)]
*  it shouldn't be disciplined. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  And that's what that's what we're losing. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=654.6s)]
*  One of the sort of the key flash points, I think, would be around from the river to [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=656.24s)]
*  the sea, right? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  Palestine should be free from the river to the sea. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=662.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=664.96s)]
*  Some people are interpreting that as a as a belief that Israel shouldn't exist. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=665.4s)]
*  Now, under the definition, you know, one of the one of the definitions of anti-Semitism [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=671.8s)]
*  under the framework was denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=676.6800000000001s)]
*  e.g. by claiming that the existence of the state of Israel is a racist endeavor. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=681.44s)]
*  Right. That is one of sort of the definitions. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=686.44s)]
*  But people who want to use that phrase, some of them say that's not what they're [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=689.04s)]
*  saying. What they're saying is that they believe that Israel should be a multi-ethnic, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=692.88s)]
*  multi-religious democracy like the United States. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=697.88s)]
*  That was kind of a hinge upon which that congressional hearing where some of the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=701.9200000000001s)]
*  congressional Republicans were hammering on the presidents of a number of the [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=707.1600000000001s)]
*  universities and saying that they were insufficiently zealous about guarding against [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=711.2s)]
*  anti-Semitism and genocide. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=715.9200000000001s)]
*  How do you think about that? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=717.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, the December 5th hearing was really a set up in a lot of ways. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=718.8s)]
*  And I found it very offensive that you have members of Congress who wouldn't criticize [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=724.4399999999999s)]
*  President Trump for hosting a Holocaust in Iran, wouldn't criticize him for [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=730.1999999999999s)]
*  criticizing, for saying immigrants are poisoning the blood of the country. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=736.04s)]
*  Now, apparently care about issues like anti-Semitism. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=739.56s)]
*  And what they set up was this claim that from the river to the sea means genocide [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=745.04s)]
*  against Jews. And are you going to stop claims for genocide against Jews? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=753.28s)]
*  Again, speech is deplorable. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=756.9599999999999s)]
*  You don't discipline people for it. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=760.56s)]
*  You use the assets of the university to go against it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  And there was a poll that came out that was at 66 percent of Jewish students here [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=766.56s)]
*  from the river to the sea as genocide against Jews. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=774.1999999999999s)]
*  And I find that that that phrase disturbing, too. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=777.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm a Zionist. I believe in the two state solution. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=781.04s)]
*  And I think some are using it to say that precisely that there should be no right of [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=783.88s)]
*  Jews to exist in that area. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=789.92s)]
*  However, 14 percent of Muslims, only 14 percent of Muslim students surveyed, see [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=791.48s)]
*  that as a call for getting rid of Jews or genocide. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=796.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think that that's that's part of the challenge is that people are hearing [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=800.88s)]
*  different things at the moment. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=806.16s)]
*  And I have a colleague at Bard who was realizing that people were throwing around [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=808.7199999999999s)]
*  terms like anti-Semitism, genocide, ethnic cleansing, settler colonialism as weapons. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=813.4s)]
*  And we're in a college. So she's put together a class. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=819.68s)]
*  I'm actually teaching the session on anti-Semitism later this week. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=822.8399999999999s)]
*  What do these words mean? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=827.04s)]
*  How do we understand? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=828.28s)]
*  Why do people hear them differently? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=829.32s)]
*  You know, those are the things that a university should do. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=831.0s)]
*  It shouldn't say here's here's a statement that's going to get you into discipline for [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=834.1600000000001s)]
*  saying as long as it's not a true threat. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=840.2800000000001s)]
*  Muslim students, Muslim people in general have had this complaint for some time about [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=842.72s)]
*  words that are important in their culture and traditions that they feel have been misused [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=847.32s)]
*  like jihad, you know, jihad, for example, for you know, you'll have people say, well, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=852.2s)]
*  jihad can mean like a jihad against bad habits. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=856.16s)]
*  You know, we're going to wage a, you know, war against bad habits of our own. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=859.4s)]
*  And they feel like, well, why do other people get to define what we think without asking [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=864.72s)]
*  us what we mean by those words? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=869.84s)]
*  So how do you redefine words that have been claimed for certain [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=872.52s)]
*  meanings? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=878.48s)]
*  Well, and it's not new. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=879.04s)]
*  I mean, it's not only about this issue. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  We see it around politics, immigration, abortion, other things, too. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=882.24s)]
*  You know, I run a hate studies center and that informs a lot of how I think about these [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=887.0s)]
*  issues. I think especially on hot button issues where your identity is tethered to an [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=892.32s)]
*  issue of perceived social justice or injustice. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=898.32s)]
*  We know from brain science and social psychology and other fields like, you know, inform [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=900.88s)]
*  hate studies. What happens to human beings? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=907.0400000000001s)]
*  We get into these sort of us versus them buckets. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=909.64s)]
*  We get into the place where we crave simplicity. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=913.04s)]
*  We crave certainty. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=915.8s)]
*  We crave symbols. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=916.92s)]
*  And I think part of what we're seeing around the question of the Ira definition and other [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=917.76s)]
*  things are questions of symbols. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=922.28s)]
*  And we don't want to engage in the complexity of why these things are so contentious. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=924.92s)]
*  We want somebody to tell us what side of a ledger we should put it on. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=929.96s)]
*  And that's part of the concern I have about the push of the Ira definition. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=934.4s)]
*  And there are a couple of bills in front of Congress at the moment that are considering [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=941.12s)]
*  using it more for educational purposes or also for funding issues and in Europe, too. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=944.5600000000001s)]
*  And I don't see that as as different from what I object to. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  What, again, Governor DeSantis, not to pick on him, but what he's doing in Florida about [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  what do we teach about gender? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  What do we teach about race? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=961.0s)]
*  I may not agree with everything that's being taught, but I don't want the state to define [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=962.76s)]
*  what's OK to teach and what isn't. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=967.4s)]
*  I want faculty and students and universities to do that. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=969.0s)]
*  And anti-Semitism is a real problem. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=974.48s)]
*  And there are Jewish students who are being intimidated. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  But the way to deal with it is not to use law to try to suppress speech we don't like. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=979.08s)]
*  It's to encourage students how to treat each other, how to realize that we're all in the [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=984.68s)]
*  same community together. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=989.84s)]
*  It's not a competition between faculty and students. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=991.52s)]
*  How do we how do we engage this moment together? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=994.96s)]
*  And why don't we have the intellectual curiosity? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=997.28s)]
*  Aren't you curious as to why they have that view? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1000.36s)]
*  Can you have the emotional empathy to imagine yourself in their shoes? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1003.24s)]
*  So those are the types of things that I think we need to focus on as opposed to just what [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1008.64s)]
*  we should be, you know, ones that get you into trouble. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1012.5600000000001s)]
*  As we are speaking now, it's the end of the semester. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1015.32s)]
*  Graduations are afoot. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1020.36s)]
*  In some places, students are being arrested. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1022.0s)]
*  They're saying they're giving them specific instructions. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1024.52s)]
*  If you don't leave by X time or going to you're going to be arrested. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1027.32s)]
*  That's already happened in a number of places. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1030.16s)]
*  So if you were advising university presidents who are addressing this, given everything [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1032.44s)]
*  that's already happened, what would you do now? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1039.08s)]
*  It's a tough question. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1041.4s)]
*  I'm glad I'm not in their seats. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1042.52s)]
*  But what I have been telling them when I have been meeting with boards and presidents and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1044.56s)]
*  so forth is that they should prioritize academic freedom in terms of whatever they [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1048.88s)]
*  do. And some of the reasons we're seeing at the moment was not prioritizing academic [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1054.5600000000002s)]
*  freedom. I think that that, you know, arresting students should be the last resort [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1059.0800000000002s)]
*  for any reason. I thought I saw a statement this morning from the president of Wesleyan, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1066.3200000000002s)]
*  basically said, as long as there's not violence, we're going to let the encampment be. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1070.64s)]
*  I understand the dynamics and difficulties with graduations and other things when people [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1075.72s)]
*  can't use that space. It's not an easy thing, but it's not going to be resolved by, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1081.16s)]
*  you know, mass arrests or mass suspensions. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1088.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think that only energizes the protesters in some way, too. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1092.0800000000002s)]
*  And I understand that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1095.52s)]
*  Kenneth Stern, thank you so much for speaking with us today. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1096.88s)]
*  It's been my honor to be with you. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1099.48s)]
*  I thank you very much. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FFAcHMO488&t=1101.64s)]
