# “Gaza Is on the Brink of Famine:” World Food Programme’s Cindy McCain | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI)
*  Well now, Gazans are facing a desperate humanitarian crisis, with food shelves still empty and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=0.0s)]
*  families struggling to feed themselves. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  Thousands were seen surrounding two aid trucks in northern Gaza last month, as crucial food [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=7.92s)]
*  deliveries remain hindered by limited safe access into the strip. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=12.8s)]
*  According to the World Food Program, executive director Cindy McCain, the territory is reaching [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=17.6s)]
*  a tipping point. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  She speaks to Walter Isaacson about the dire situation in conflict zones and why food insecurity [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=23.76s)]
*  is a global concern. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=29.08s)]
*  Thank you, Biana and Cindy McCain. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=31.36s)]
*  Welcome back to the show. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=33.64s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=35.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=36.92s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken just a few days ago was in a World Food Program warehouse [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=37.92s)]
*  in Jordan talking about how important what you all are doing in helping Gaza. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=44.48s)]
*  Tell me about the situation there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=51.16s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=53.68s)]
*  In all the years that most of the very senior people that work for me have been doing this, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=56.76s)]
*  they've never seen anything quite like this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=61.44s)]
*  Gaza is on the brink of famine. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  The things that we're asking for with regards to WFP and feeding people are safe access [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=69.4s)]
*  to be able to get our trucks in and the ability to be de-conflicted so that we can work safely [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  with when we're on the ground there. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  It's a mess. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=84.36s)]
*  And more importantly in this, until we get more access, that means more gates, more routes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=85.64s)]
*  in the country and in a faster and better way, we're not going to be able to feed people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=94.44s)]
*  Well, Secretary of State Blinken, as I said, was just at one of the warehouses in Jordan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=99.72s)]
*  Then he went to visit Israel, visit Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=106.12s)]
*  Has he been helping you to push for access? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=110.36s)]
*  Yes, Secretary Blinken has been wonderful. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=113.92s)]
*  He's been helping, you know, certainly carrying our message and the message of others as well [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=116.92s)]
*  and the importance of why it's necessary that we get in. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=122.92s)]
*  Again, we are trying to stave off famine in Gaza. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  And unless we can get in there and begin to feed in a large manner and in a way that can, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=130.68s)]
*  not just in the shelters, but in communities around that where people have been pushed into, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=135.8s)]
*  we're not going to be able to save lives. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=141.56s)]
*  We have little children now that are really starving to death. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=143.36s)]
*  And we have families that are desperate. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=146.84s)]
*  You hear about the trucks being raided or you hear about the disruption, the unrest that's going on. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=150.72000000000003s)]
*  People are desperate. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  As you know, you will do anything to feed your family. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=159.84s)]
*  And that's why this is so important that we be able to get in and make sure that we can feed people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=163.0s)]
*  The chief economist of the World Food Program said that of the 2.2 million people in Gaza now, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=168.76s)]
*  there is a high chance of famine, that there's a food insecurity crisis going on. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=177.64s)]
*  Explain to me what that means. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=184.92s)]
*  Well, it means that, yeah, I'll put it, take it down to very simple tones here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=187.8s)]
*  So there's a family, let's say, of eight people and six of those are kids. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, the parents are not going to feed themselves if their only option is to feed their children. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=199.92s)]
*  They're making hard choices about who and how to feed, how much to feed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=204.88s)]
*  And just access to be able to get the food, just from a bottom line standpoint. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=210.88s)]
*  These are the kind of choices that these people are up against right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=219.27999999999997s)]
*  And these are the kinds of things that we at WP are trying desperately to make sure that we can help, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  help not just in the short term, but in the long term also. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  How much food is getting into Gaza? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=233.44s)]
*  And is there enough food if you could just get the entry into the trucks into Gaza? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Yes, there is enough access to food. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  We are beginning to put a sizable amount together. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=248.27999999999997s)]
*  We've already started it. It is not complete yet. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=253.16s)]
*  But that amount of food, when we do put this in place, can feed Gaza for three months, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=256.04s)]
*  the entire population of Gaza. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=262.44s)]
*  So that's why the access is so important. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=264.92s)]
*  If we can get in there in a major way to not just feed, but make sure that the food is [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=267.24s)]
*  first emergency food and then a food that's more subsistent for a long term. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=275.88s)]
*  Right now, we're giving out emergency rations. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=280.68s)]
*  And we need to do much more of that, especially when we're talking about young children. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=284.44000000000005s)]
*  As you know, UNICEF has talked about this a great deal. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  And the issues that we're having with our very young children as a result of it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war. Is that true? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=295.96000000000004s)]
*  I can't answer that question. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=305.56s)]
*  All we're trying to do is deal with what we know is happening right now on the ground. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=308.28s)]
*  And that is we need to get in and feed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=313.24s)]
*  The important part of all this is making sure that the world understands [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=316.12s)]
*  the desperation that's involved here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  And so I'll leave those discussions for our politicians and for our UN hierarchy. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=323.4s)]
*  But what I need right now is safe access and the ability to get in and feed. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=329.15999999999997s)]
*  There are more than 300 million people around the world who face starvation, food crises. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=334.6s)]
*  What's the cause of that? Is it a lack of food or is it a lack of the ability to get food to the right place? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=344.2s)]
*  It's a combination of things. And I'll start with climate change. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=352.68s)]
*  A large portion of Africa is in this kind of food desperation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=357.0s)]
*  Food desperation because of climate change. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=363.08s)]
*  And climate change has been a disaster. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=367.0s)]
*  And I'll speak specifically to this Sahel right now. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=369.0s)]
*  With the lack of rain, the lack of ability to be able to plant crops and grow crops, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=373.88s)]
*  people are starving to death. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=378.68s)]
*  And so it's up to organizations like ours to get in again and feed them. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  The situation worldwide is desperate. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=387.24s)]
*  We're not looking at just a few countries. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=390.68s)]
*  We're looking at many countries that don't have the ability to adequately feed their populations. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=392.6s)]
*  And that's where WFP comes into play. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  I was reading the WFP website, which I suggest all of our viewers do. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  And besides climate change, it says the biggest driver is conflict. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=406.28000000000003s)]
*  Tell me about that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=414.04s)]
*  Well, conflict has caused a great deal of this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=415.08s)]
*  And I'll speak now to Sudan, especially because we're all aware of what has occurred in Sudan. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=419.56s)]
*  But as a result of that, the refugee flow has been astronomical going into Chad and Ethiopia [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=426.44s)]
*  and other countries within the region. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=432.59999999999997s)]
*  And we've had to make some very tough decisions. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  WFP, I mean, have had to make some very tough decisions because we don't have the funding. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=438.2s)]
*  And so I've had to deal with in my own mind taking food from Hungary to give to the starving. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=443.96s)]
*  And that's a decision that we have to make almost every day. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=451.8s)]
*  And so places like Chad, like Haiti, like DRC Congo, like Somalia, regions like that are [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=455.71999999999997s)]
*  we just don't we're spread thin and we just don't have the money. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=466.36s)]
*  We had plenty of funding several years ago, but we don't have the money now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=469.32s)]
*  And so I'm having to make some very serious, tough decisions. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=473.24s)]
*  Tell me about who's getting cut because of these decisions. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=476.52s)]
*  Well, we're shortening rations. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=480.36s)]
*  So in some some areas we used to give rations that would last a year. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=482.04s)]
*  Now we're down. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=488.2s)]
*  Then we reduce it to six months. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=488.92s)]
*  And now we've reduced it in some cases to zero. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=491.40000000000003s)]
*  And Afghanistan is a good description of that. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=495.24s)]
*  We can't we just don't have the money to be able to feed everyone. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=497.64s)]
*  So we're having to cut people from the rolls and cut people from access to food. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=501.08s)]
*  I was standing in a line with a woman. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=506.28s)]
*  I was in in South Sudan and I watched she was pregnant and I watched her. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=509.4s)]
*  The gentleman behind the desk say, your rations are up. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=516.12s)]
*  I can't give you any more. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=519.72s)]
*  And I mean, she was pregnant and had two young children. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=521.24s)]
*  These are the kinds of decisions we're having to make and we shouldn't have to make those. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=524.6s)]
*  I continue to raise the flag around the world about the desperation and the importance of [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=528.8399999999999s)]
*  why we need to feed and why we need to be in there, why we need the money to do it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=535.24s)]
*  The WFP faces a 15 billion dollar shortfall this coming year. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=540.52s)]
*  Why do we face such a shortfall of funding? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=547.9599999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people are a lot of countries, I should say, have they're weary. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=551.64s)]
*  We've seen crisis after crisis after crisis and their own constituencies are saying enough. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=557.64s)]
*  Let's pay attention to our own home. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=564.92s)]
*  I certainly understand that, but still it doesn't make these starving people go away. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=568.12s)]
*  Things just don't disappear. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=574.12s)]
*  So I do the very best I can to make sure that people understand what's going on around the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=575.96s)]
*  world and why it's important that we continue to do this. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=582.12s)]
*  Because if we're not going to feed them now, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=585.64s)]
*  conflict's going to take over, the bad guys are going to roll in, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=589.0s)]
*  and then we've got an even bigger problem. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=592.36s)]
*  So that's why I continue to do what we do. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=595.08s)]
*  Hopefully testify in front of Congress, speak to, I'm going to Davos this coming weekend [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=598.04s)]
*  to talk about this crisis worldwide and why we need to be extra diligent about what we do [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=603.8s)]
*  and why it's important that we give even more. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=610.04s)]
*  You've just made the connection between feeding people and national security. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=613.16s)]
*  It's something I've heard you talk about quite a bit. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=620.5999999999999s)]
*  Explain why this is not just a humanitarian issue, but a national security issue. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=622.76s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=630.12s)]
*  I'll talk about a place like Somalia, or I'll talk about a place, again, like the Sahel and [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=632.68s)]
*  some of the other regions in there. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=637.96s)]
*  Without adequate food, people will, as I said, will do anything. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=640.2800000000001s)]
*  It makes it easier for the bad guys to roll in, and that becomes a national security issue. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=645.24s)]
*  That's a national security issue for the United States of America as well. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=649.96s)]
*  So I appeal to my own government and the governments around the world to look at it [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=654.44s)]
*  from a national security perspective, because if we don't feed them, the bad guys are going to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=660.52s)]
*  get right in there and make sure that they do feed them. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=665.88s)]
*  How is the best way to make sure that we don't have food insecurity and food problems? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=669.0s)]
*  Is it giving away food, or is there a deeper solution to the problem? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=675.64s)]
*  Well, we have to approach the root cause of it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=681.96s)]
*  Is it climate change? Is it conflict? Is it the cost also? Cost is a big deliverer in this as well. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=686.52s)]
*  We need to get at the root causes, teaching people, not just teaching people how to farm, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=696.84s)]
*  but giving them the tools and the water to do so. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=702.52s)]
*  In many cases, it comes down to water. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=706.6s)]
*  And I think from a worldwide standpoint, I really talk a great deal about this when I'm out and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=711.0s)]
*  about, because it is important that we take a look at the root causes and make sure that we [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=715.48s)]
*  can address them, aside from just giving food, but making sure that we can make them self-sufficient. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=719.96s)]
*  What are you all doing to do that? So it's not just a food giveaway program. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=727.4000000000001s)]
*  In fact, some would argue food giveaways could be harmful in the long run. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=733.08s)]
*  So tell me what you're doing to face that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=737.72s)]
*  Again, we have lots of different programs going on around the world. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=741.0s)]
*  And I'll use Central America, the dry zone, as a good example of this. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=746.76s)]
*  As I said, we're giving people the tools. So what does that mean? Making sure that they have land [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=752.28s)]
*  to farm on, making sure that they have access to seed and to water, most importantly, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=757.8s)]
*  and making sure that they can get them to the market. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=765.8s)]
*  And so it's a matter of just supporting and giving them the ability to be able to do it [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=768.52s)]
*  themselves. No one wants to leave their homes. No one wants to not be able to feed their family. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=774.2s)]
*  So for us to be able to put programs in place, to be able to do just that, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=779.72s)]
*  has been very successful around the world. And also, a thing that we call cash-based transfers [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=786.12s)]
*  gives people the ability, women particularly, because it empowers women, the ability to buy [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=794.12s)]
*  on the local market. Rather than us giving food to them, we give them a cash-based transfer so [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=800.44s)]
*  that they can buy on the local market. That helps everyone. It helps the entire community. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=806.5200000000001s)]
*  So that's something that's been very successful that WP actually started [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=812.7600000000001s)]
*  and now has become kind of a worldwide tool. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=816.84s)]
*  Ukraine used to be referred to as the breadbasket of, a breadbasket of the world. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=819.96s)]
*  Tell me what the war in Ukraine has done to exacerbate this issue. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=825.24s)]
*  Yes, your description is exactly correct. It's been, with the inability in some cases and a much [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=830.36s)]
*  smaller ability to be able to get grain out, it is really hampered how we feed. And I'll use [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=842.6s)]
*  Madagascar as a good example and other regions of Africa where we can bring grain out by ship [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=850.36s)]
*  and be able to then, as you know, replenish it and do what we do with what WP does with it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=857.88s)]
*  We've not been able to do that in an adequate manner. We've gotten some grain out, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=863.4s)]
*  as you know, but we haven't gotten enough out, not to where we were before. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=868.1999999999999s)]
*  So the Ukraine situation has been damaging in so many different ways, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=873.3199999999999s)]
*  but from a food standpoint, it's been devastating. And so we've had other suppliers of things, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=881.0s)]
*  of grains that we need. We've had to make sure that we can source it. It's much more expensive. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=889.72s)]
*  That costs us money, which means it's later getting to where it should go. And of course, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=895.96s)]
*  the expense is unbelievable. The global community has said that it really wants to end hunger [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=900.92s)]
*  and malnutrition by 2030. What does that mean? And how could that be done? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=907.88s)]
*  Well, I will work with anybody that can offer something like that. I really will. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=916.76s)]
*  It means that we all need to work together, that we can no longer—this isn't a problem [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=923.0s)]
*  that's on somebody else's doorstep. This is a problem that's on our own doorstep. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=927.96s)]
*  We have to deal with hunger. And it does everybody good. When people are eating, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=932.52s)]
*  they're calm. They're not looking for trouble. They don't become [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=941.08s)]
*  recruited by these guys that come through with these nefarious characters that come through. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=948.6800000000001s)]
*  It helps all of us. And so whenever I speak to groups or countries or heads of state, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=955.08s)]
*  I say, listen, you need to be in this because this will affect you. Whether it is now or not, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=961.24s)]
*  it will affect you. And so just reminding the world and reminding our world leaders of the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=966.9200000000001s)]
*  importance of working together on this. And that sounds, I know, very lofty. How do you get the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=972.44s)]
*  world to work together? We can't seem to do anything together. But I think on the arena [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=976.9200000000001s)]
*  of food, we need to work together. We have to. This job at the World Food Program, especially [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=982.6800000000001s)]
*  when we look at what's happening in Ukraine. Now we're looking at what's happening in Gaza, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=988.76s)]
*  around the world. It's got to be grueling. I mean, it's really tough. You're based in Rome. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=993.08s)]
*  You're traveling to places like Somalia and seeing it. What drives you to do this? What keeps you [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=999.08s)]
*  going? You know, I can honestly tell you, I've been, I consider myself a humanitarian and I have [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1005.3199999999999s)]
*  been most of my adult life. And what drives me is I know that we can do better. I know that we can [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1012.28s)]
*  help. And so what drives me are the people that I see. And I mentioned the girl that was pregnant [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1019.56s)]
*  with the two kids. That's what drives me is our ability as an organization and as a world [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1024.92s)]
*  to work together to feed people in desperate situations. And that's really what drives me. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1032.76s)]
*  What keeps me awake is not being able to feed them. Those, you talk about the stress of a job, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1038.84s)]
*  that's what keeps me awake. And what, and what to me is the most gruesome thing that I face [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1043.9599999999998s)]
*  is not being able to feed people. And so it's twofold. It helps me [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1049.8799999999999s)]
*  continue on. It also breaks my heart. Cindy McCain, thanks so much for joining us. And [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1056.28s)]
*  thanks so much for what you do. Thank you. I appreciate it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbNA0WH6RI&t=1062.44s)]
