Video Description: Ceasefire negotiations in Cairo between Israel and Hamas have reached a delicate phase, according to mediator Qatar. Six months after Hamas launched a brutal terror attack on October 7th, murdering well over a thousand Israelis -- and still holding more than 100 hostages -- it is unclear what the next move might be. Akbar Shahid Ahmed, HuffPost Senior Diplomatic Correspondent, has interviewed two of Hamasâ€™ leaders. He joins the show.

# What Is Hamas Thinking Now? Journalist on Rare Interview w/ Top Hamas Leaders | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg)
*  Next, ceasefire negotiations in Cairo between Israel and Hamas have reached a delicate phase. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=0.0s)]
*  That's according to the mediator Qatar. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Six months after it launched that brutal terror attack on October 7th, murdering over a thousand [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=9.32s)]
*  Israelis, some 1,200, and still holding more than 100 hostages. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=15.08s)]
*  What are Hamas's next moves? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=19.84s)]
*  Michel Martin spoke with Akbar Shahid Ahmed, HuffPost's senior diplomatic correspondent, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=21.84s)]
*  who's interviewed two Hamas leaders. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=27.52s)]
*  Thanks, Christian. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  Akbar Shahid Ahmed, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Michel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=34.68s)]
*  Obviously, we're very intrigued by the piece that you posted in Huffington Post titled [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=36.08s)]
*  What is Hamas Thinking Now? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=39.879999999999995s)]
*  You know, Hamas is an organization that a lot of people are used to talking about, but [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=41.44s)]
*  not many people have the opportunity to speak to. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  So the first question I had for you is what gave you the idea to try to go to some senior [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=49.0s)]
*  members of the leadership? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=55.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  So being based here in D.C., you know, we get to hear a lot from U.S. government spokespeople, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=62.48s)]
*  We have a lot of foreign officials coming and going, Europeans, Israelis, and to some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=63.48s)]
*  extent some Palestinians, right? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=67.52s)]
*  But if we think about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and this moment since October 7th, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=69.32s)]
*  Hamas is an integral part of the story, right? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=74.28s)]
*  Like them, hate them, denounce them, whatever your feelings are, you have to deal with them, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=77.24s)]
*  right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=81.96s)]
*  The people who set off this episode of fighting and they are who Israel is, you know, in Gaza [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  with U.S. support fighting as we speak today. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=88.28s)]
*  So my editors and I in the fall and kind of winter side to think, how can we try to get [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=91.39999999999999s)]
*  that perspective, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=97.88s)]
*  To frame it in a way that informs our audience does so responsibly. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=99.16s)]
*  And it was quite a challenging endeavor, both the logistics of it and the kind of taking [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=103.36s)]
*  on that responsibility, right, of talking to these people and to some extent giving [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=110.36s)]
*  them a platform to reach a major American audience. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=114.28s)]
*  Well, say a little bit more about why you think that's important because, you know, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=117.32s)]
*  I think people do know that Hamas is considered a terrorist organization, you know, by the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=120.75999999999999s)]
*  United States and other governments. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=125.16s)]
*  So just if you were just for people who just questioned the lot, the interview itself, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=127.28s)]
*  would you just say more about why you think it was so important to do? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=131.72s)]
*  So Hamas, as you mentioned, is listed as a terror organization by the U.S., by the EU. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=136.6s)]
*  In fact, a lot of Americans can face legal penalties for engaging with Hamas to some [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=141.32s)]
*  extent, right? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=146.4s)]
*  So there's a real barrier and systemic reluctance to engaging with them. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=147.4s)]
*  From our point of view, we felt this is a viewpoint that we want to not only convene, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  to some extent we do get Hamas messaging, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=160.16s)]
*  We get their documents, we get that statement. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=162.52s)]
*  But we want to really challenge it and press it and engage with it and ask them tough questions [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=165.16s)]
*  and take that kind of hour, two hours to sit with them and say, let's talk about civilians. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=169.84s)]
*  Let's talk about the fact that many Palestinians are not supportive of you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=175.52s)]
*  Let's talk about your ruling Gaza. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=178.68s)]
*  Let's talk about your vision. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=180.12s)]
*  And you can't do that unless you're having a conversation or a dialogue. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=181.44s)]
*  So who did you wish to speak to? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  And what role do they play in the Hamas organization? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=187.64000000000001s)]
*  I wanted everyone. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  I wanted Khalid Mishal, the former head of Hamas, Khalil al-Hayya, one of the top negotiators, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=192.0s)]
*  Musab al-Marzouk and Bassem Naeem. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=199.24s)]
*  And I was able to get the latitude. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=201.36s)]
*  Musab al-Marzouk, who has been the second in command of Hamas. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=204.08s)]
*  He's been a major figure since their founding in the 80s, actually has lived in the US for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=208.64s)]
*  a while, has lived in various countries, but always been central to their operations. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=213.2s)]
*  And he's actually designated as a terrorist by the US, especially designated national. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=218.04s)]
*  He's under sanctions because the US says he's funneled. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=222.68s)]
*  He's been one of the chief funders. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=225.92s)]
*  I also spoke with Bassem Naeem, who is really interesting because he is someone who was [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=227.64s)]
*  Gaza based, has always been Gaza based. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=232.64s)]
*  He was a minister in Hamas's administration in Gaza. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=235.12s)]
*  His wife and children are still in Gaza. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=237.96s)]
*  He happened to be out of Gaza, he said accidentally in his word prior to October 7th and hasn't [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=239.84s)]
*  been able to return. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=246.16s)]
*  I have to start with October 7th. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=247.32s)]
*  What is their point of view about what they were trying to accomplish on October 7th? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=249.52s)]
*  And do they think they accomplished it? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=254.04s)]
*  That's one of the most striking things. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=256.4s)]
*  You know, I think October 7th is such a touchstone of trauma for Israel and for many people, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=258.08s)]
*  you know, with links to Israel, who were affected by that and what's happened since. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=264.0s)]
*  From that point of view, despite everything that's happened since, right, we're talking [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=268.76s)]
*  about close to 34,000 Palestinians at least dead. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=272.32s)]
*  Of course, 1,100 Israelis, most of them civilians, also dead. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=277.2s)]
*  Many hostages still in Hamas's control. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=280.44s)]
*  Hamas still believes it was worth it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=282.56s)]
*  Their argument is we wanted to draw back global attention to Israel-Palestine. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=285.64s)]
*  We felt it was slipping away. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=290.32s)]
*  We felt the US didn't care about a resolution to this conflict. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=291.92s)]
*  And to some extent, we felt Arab states had stopped caring. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  And so we really needed this kind of big explosion. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=299.6s)]
*  And they're telling, their narrative is, this isn't about October 7th per se. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=302.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, specifically they use this phrase, history didn't begin on October 7th. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  So they're talking about this kind of, obviously, decades-long Israeli policy of subjugating [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=311.6s)]
*  Palestinians to a large degree, right? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  And they're also talking about the last two years in which you've seen a very far-right [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  administration in Israel and you've seen these rising attacks by settlers in the West Bank, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  attacks on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, this kind of sense of the window is closing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  And so from that point of view, we're talking about Israel-Palestine. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=331.88s)]
*  So for all what they would see as collateral damage, and it's a very, very heavy toll for [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=334.96s)]
*  all of that, to them, it's still worth it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=340.44s)]
*  Do they agree or do they at least acknowledge what the Israelis and other governments have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=342.8s)]
*  been saying is that they essentially hide among the civilian population, that they [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=347.68s)]
*  basically they are using civilians as human shields? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=351.4s)]
*  How do they respond to that? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=354.68s)]
*  They argue, look, we were the administration of this place, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=356.4s)]
*  From 2006 onwards, Hamas was running Gaza. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  So lots of government officials, police officers, anyone who's there in that administration [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  is Hamas linked. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=367.08000000000004s)]
*  So to say they are hiding within the civilian population from Hamas' point of view, well, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  that's just the people who live there. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=373.20000000000005s)]
*  So their argument is they are the civilian population. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=374.16s)]
*  They are the civilian population. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=376.48s)]
*  Interesting. OK, were they trying to kill as many people as possible? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=378.44s)]
*  What do they say about that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=383.0s)]
*  I press them on. Look, the majority of the people that you killed on October 7th, we [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  know indisputably, were civilians. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=388.68s)]
*  They were civilians. We know that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=391.16s)]
*  Their argument, and it's so interesting that they're not trying to deny that or disavow [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  it to the extent to which actually some some folks abroad have tried to do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=397.68s)]
*  They're saying it was chaos. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  We only talked to military targets. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=403.40000000000003s)]
*  We did not mean for civilians to get killed, but they were not denying that the majority [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=405.88s)]
*  was civilians. A music festival is a military target. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=410.32s)]
*  I mean, wait, wait, I'm just right. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=413.04s)]
*  So they say what they actually say that they were not trying to kill civilians, that they [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=416.2s)]
*  said it was some sort of a what, a logistical or tactical breakdown or something of that [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=420.96s)]
*  nature? But the way we put it in the piece was to say they really deflected the blame [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=425.47999999999996s)]
*  from the attackers to the attacked. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=430.96s)]
*  Right. They said, well, you know, Israel should have been defending better. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=433.12s)]
*  And because there were not strong Israeli forces on that other side of the border, once [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=437.44s)]
*  Hamas and the others who were with them broke through. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=442.20000000000005s)]
*  That's why so many targets were attacked. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=444.92s)]
*  And they argue that in their telling thousands of people, that's a really high estimate. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=447.12s)]
*  We didn't feel comfortable putting that in the piece, but that's really what they they [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  estimate. Certainly, we know that many people who were not initially involved in the attack [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=454.76000000000005s)]
*  from Gaza did come through into Israel and carry out some of those atrocities. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=460.04s)]
*  Do they acknowledge raping women? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=463.72s)]
*  Do they acknowledge using sexual violence as a tool of war? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=465.56s)]
*  They have not acknowledged that. They are they are refusing to acknowledge that so far. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=468.6s)]
*  How do they. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=472.28000000000003s)]
*  Account for all of the people who've lost their lives, surely they have lost some of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=475.44s)]
*  their own relatives and loved ones. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=479.88s)]
*  Many, I mean, we saw the top of the seat abroad is my honey, his children and grandchildren [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=481.72s)]
*  were killed in this really strike just last week. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=487.72s)]
*  Right. So many of them have lost family members. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  One of the people I met, you know, who was helping coordinate the interview, I asked [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  about his family back in Gaza. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=496.48s)]
*  He said, yes, you know, my mother was hit by shrapnel on her head. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=497.68s)]
*  I lost two nieces. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=500.48s)]
*  I've lost these various uncles. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=502.0s)]
*  And it's so striking. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=504.12s)]
*  I mean, that they are they're able to talk about that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=505.59999999999997s)]
*  They do acknowledge it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=508.48s)]
*  They seem visibly, genuinely upset. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=509.8s)]
*  And then in that telling, it's worth it in that telling the people of Gaza knew what [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=512.12s)]
*  we were signing up for. There's a real argument we had that right. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  Did all the people of Gaza really agree to launch this attack and suffer the war that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=521.36s)]
*  followed? But that's that telling. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=525.6s)]
*  Simultaneously, they want to say this operation was worth it, but it didn't go the way we [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=528.08s)]
*  wanted it to go because there was chaos. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=534.2s)]
*  Civilians were killed and also so much of that message, so much of their posturing. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=536.4s)]
*  Right. And what they said and even when I pressed them was we are willing to go to a [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  negotiating table. They're not willing to acknowledge Israel tried to exist, but they [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  both reaffirmed that they are standing by this 1967 borders idea. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=552.76s)]
*  Right. This idea of Palestine does not need to exist necessarily in all the places where [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=558.6s)]
*  the state of Israel is now. It could exist in just the West Bank and Gaza. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=563.28s)]
*  And the fact that they were saying that paradoxically with the justification of the [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=566.76s)]
*  attack is an attempt to moderate from them. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=571.72s)]
*  Right. So they want to be seen as we don't want to keep fighting. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=574.48s)]
*  And one of them did explicitly say to me, I say in the piece, you know, we we are using [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=578.12s)]
*  violent tools because the Israelis are pushing us towards this. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=582.52s)]
*  So they do. They also want to be seen as as moderate and rational to some extent. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=584.84s)]
*  Do they acknowledge that there is really no way to know how many people in Gaza feel [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  about their leadership since they have not had elections since when? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=597.1600000000001s)]
*  2006. How do they talk about that? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=601.72s)]
*  I'll take a step back. I think, you know, I was able prior to the war in 2019, I was [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  I was able to actually report from Gaza and talk to a lot of people on the ground there [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=609.56s)]
*  and experience it before the destruction and kind of be there at a period of Hamas rule. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=613.68s)]
*  Right. And talk to people about what that felt like. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=618.0s)]
*  I think important to remember, yes, people who live there did not have a chance to vote. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=620.88s)]
*  We have had surveys. We have had people speak up against Hamas rule and they do [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=628.52s)]
*  acknowledge that. So I did press them on a couple of surveys done by quite respected [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=633.04s)]
*  Palestinian pollsters. And I said, look, I talked to people when I was in Gaza in 2019, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=636.8s)]
*  who said, I didn't remember this one woman. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=641.16s)]
*  I'll never forget. Right. She said, I have not been able to practice as a lawyer since [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=643.48s)]
*  Hamas took over because I refused to cover my head in court because I don't want to do [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=648.04s)]
*  that. That's not my belief. Their argument is we tolerate everyone. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=652.4399999999999s)]
*  We understand that there are some people who are more secular. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  We understand that people have different ideologies. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=659.36s)]
*  They are not. They accept that they do not speak for all or even the majority of the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=661.84s)]
*  Palestinian people. I think what's so striking is that they say and this is really hard to [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=668.2s)]
*  dispute polls in the West Bank, in Gaza, do show that the majority of Palestinians are [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  supportive of resistance towards Israel. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=680.48s)]
*  And the narrative that Hamas is saying is not we think everyone is supportive of us as [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=683.1600000000001s)]
*  Hamas and everything we want to do, but they are saying we think the Palestinians [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=687.36s)]
*  are sick of the status quo, want to see a change, and we are the only people aggressively [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=691.5200000000001s)]
*  doing something to change it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=697.12s)]
*  What are they willing to accept? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=698.8000000000001s)]
*  What is their end goal of how this conflict ends? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=700.6400000000001s)]
*  Are they willing to fight to the last Palestinian? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  I think they would say no. I think they would say it's not our policy that is about [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=708.2s)]
*  fighting, fighting, fighting. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  They're arguing, acknowledge us, bring us into a political process, which the U.S. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  right is not willing to do. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=720.36s)]
*  So the PLO, the Palestine Liberation Organization, is who the U.S. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=721.4s)]
*  negotiates with and Israel negotiates with. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=725.36s)]
*  It's been very clear from the U.S. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=727.64s)]
*  and Israel side, we will not see Hamas in that party and we won't deal with them. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=729.04s)]
*  They're saying we are an indisputable part of the Palestinian fabric. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=732.56s)]
*  And I was struck, Michelle, by how much they wanted to present themselves as not [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  speaking for every last Palestinian. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=741.76s)]
*  They said we're talking to other Palestinian factions, even ones who they have hated and [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=743.72s)]
*  have open fighting with, like Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=748.04s)]
*  And they said, well, we want to reach a deal among the Palestinians. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=751.8399999999999s)]
*  Let us do that and then let us negotiate. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=756.48s)]
*  Essentially, they're saying you can't exclude us from that Palestinian party politics. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=759.4s)]
*  So that's the part of the paradigm that needs to shift. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=764.12s)]
*  But I was also struck to your point about endgame by a sense of urgency that they seem [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=766.8s)]
*  to feel in terms of in their framing, in their framing, that Israel is getting more [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=771.3199999999999s)]
*  conservative and right wing. Right. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=776.64s)]
*  And especially after October 7th and both who show us this support within Israel for [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=778.08s)]
*  giving Palestinians the state has diminished. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=783.3199999999999s)]
*  Right. And it's really a benefit to Benjamin Netanyahu has explicitly said, I'm not going [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=785.8s)]
*  to give Palestine a state. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=788.96s)]
*  We're not going to have a reward for October 7th. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=790.1999999999999s)]
*  And I do think that was this kind of concern on their side, genuine or not, but certainly [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=792.68s)]
*  they want to express it, that we may be lose the window, may be closing. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  Israel may be getting even more hardline. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=801.6s)]
*  And then when we go, then we're locked into conflict, which they say they don't want. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=803.84s)]
*  Interesting. What are some of your takeaways? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  I was struck by how much they wanted to talk about US and Israeli politics, frankly. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=811.2s)]
*  I mean, I did not expect them to be name checking various ministers in the Israeli [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=816.36s)]
*  cabinet or asking me what I thought about the youth protest movement. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=820.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that is another interesting part of how they see themselves and want to be seen. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=825.84s)]
*  They want to be seen as a political actor. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=831.92s)]
*  You can argue I went out and tolerated that they've done too many horrible atrocities. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=833.92s)]
*  But that's what they are saying. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=839.04s)]
*  We want to be seen as part of a global political conversation. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=840.6800000000001s)]
*  And the fact that they are tracking where might Biden be because of the election? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=843.72s)]
*  How is he reacting to voters in Michigan and Wisconsin? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  I was really struck. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=850.6s)]
*  You mean by state? You mean they had that granular an interest in some of the political [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=851.76s)]
*  developments in the United States? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=859.0s)]
*  You know, I have been remiss. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=860.64s)]
*  The hostages. Was that always part of the plan? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=862.52s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=867.2s)]
*  Explicitly, that was part of the plan. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=869.08s)]
*  And they told me as much. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=870.88s)]
*  And there's a history to that. Right. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=872.72s)]
*  So often Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups have been able to get a lot of [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=874.08s)]
*  Palestinian political prisoners out by taking a relatively small number of Israelis and [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=880.24s)]
*  doing these spots in their argument. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=884.44s)]
*  They would say we only tried wanted to take military hostages, only soldiers. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=886.76s)]
*  I pushed them on how many hostages are still alive, Michelle, because I think that's a [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  really it's a really important question. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=895.48s)]
*  We know there's more than 100 who are not back yet. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=897.64s)]
*  How many of those are corpses? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=901.36s)]
*  How many of those are alive? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=903.4s)]
*  They told me at that time 40. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=904.96s)]
*  We've now seen negotiations that maybe they only have up to 20. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  But I think something important to remember is their definition of hostage and who's a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=912.08s)]
*  civilian is quite different from the US and Israel's. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=916.32s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Children. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=919.0s)]
*  There are children taken hostage. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=920.1600000000001s)]
*  How could those not be? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=921.84s)]
*  Are they not? Children, children, older people? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=923.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes, but they would classify even off duty soldiers as combatants, which is not a [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=927.36s)]
*  classification that the US and Israel would use. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=932.6800000000001s)]
*  Says a little bit of like talking, talking at cross wires in that way. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=934.7600000000001s)]
*  I think there is a historical precedent. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=940.16s)]
*  For people who have used terrorist means and violence to achieve political goals being [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=946.0s)]
*  brought into governments, I think that we saw that in Northern Ireland, where the IRA [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=953.28s)]
*  has become a part of a political sort of dialogue once they agree to lay down arms. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=960.24s)]
*  We've seen that in Colombia. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=967.12s)]
*  So do you think it's possible that there is a way that this group, which has committed [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=969.0400000000001s)]
*  acts of terrorism, could be persuaded to make some sort of a deal where they lay down [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=975.96s)]
*  their arms in exchange for being seen as a legitimate political actor? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=981.96s)]
*  I'll respond to you in two ways, Michelle. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=986.4s)]
*  I think the first is to think about the players on the board and who would need to make [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=988.08s)]
*  that possible. So Hamas would need to both acknowledge its own responsibility for these [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=992.5600000000001s)]
*  militant acts, right, for the violence, for these atrocities, and to kind of walk away [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=998.4s)]
*  from some of the open anti-Semitism and promises to wipe out the entire state of Israel [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1004.1999999999999s)]
*  that they've had. I was struck by how much US officials, sources of mine, reached out [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1008.76s)]
*  and were really interested in this piece, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1015.8s)]
*  Really almost grateful that this piece came out, really curious because they are not able [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1018.56s)]
*  to have that interaction. And what that said to me is that set me at levels of national [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1023.12s)]
*  security establishment, there's an awareness of what you're saying, right, that the Preston [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1028.08s)]
*  is there, that Hamas is part of this fabric. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1031.6s)]
*  And what can you do? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  And the other aspect of that is just the readership response that we've had. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1035.72s)]
*  That's really said to me that maybe there's a possibility here for a different kind of [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1040.8s)]
*  conversation about this group and engagement with them. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1045.3999999999999s)]
*  We've had one of the highest levels of reader engagement of any piece we've had in five [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1048.08s)]
*  years, right? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1053.1999999999998s)]
*  Readers have gone deep into this piece. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1054.12s)]
*  It's a 6,000 word behemoth. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1055.8s)]
*  I mean, this is not a joke. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  Readers have gone really far down, something we can track. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1058.68s)]
*  And I think they are almost starved for understanding and seeing this kind of engagement and [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1061.84s)]
*  presentation of these viewpoints with appropriate context. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1069.52s)]
*  Do I think that'll happen? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1073.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people who don't want that to happen. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1074.44s)]
*  But I was struck by how much the Hamas figures, to a large degree, were presenting themselves, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1077.12s)]
*  take it seriously or not. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1082.3999999999999s)]
*  But in their argument, at least test it. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1083.8s)]
*  They were saying just test us, try it and test it and see what happens. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1086.36s)]
*  I think the question is whether the US, Israel, other players can get there. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1090.28s)]
*  Akbar, Swahid Ahmed, thank you so much for speaking with us today. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1094.6s)]
*  Thank you so much, Misha. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQyVJeogbg&t=1097.9199999999998s)]
