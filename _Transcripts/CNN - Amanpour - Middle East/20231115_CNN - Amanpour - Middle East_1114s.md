Video Description: Laila El-Haddad is a Palestinian American journalist who is concerned about possible genocide in Gaza. She is part of a lawsuit filed against the Biden administration which alleges it has failed to prevent genocide. She argues that the governmentâ€™s reluctance to call for a ceasefire is not only hurting Gazans on the ground, but also Arab and Muslim Americans who are subject to heightened Islamophobia.

*  having this conversation, the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  Biden administration has not [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  responded yet to this lawsuit, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=112.38000000000001s)]
*  but President Biden has said [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=114.18s)]
*  repeatedly in the past that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=117.38000000000001s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  itself from a terror attack. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=120.72000000000001s)]
*  Why are you saying that the U.S. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=123.18s)]
*  is failing to uphold [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  international law? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=128.72s)]
*  Well, it's the biggest burden [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=130.88s)]
*  which is the burden of proof, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=134.24s)]
*  which is proving intent to [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  commit genocide, has been proven [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=137.24s)]
*  for us in numerous statements [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  by Israeli officials themselves. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=141.62s)]
*  And our government here, the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=143.22s)]
*  United States, has been abetting [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=144.22s)]
*  that, abetting the unfolding [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=147.22s)]
*  genocide whose intent has [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=149.22s)]
*  already been proven by way of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=151.22s)]
*  diplomatic cover, by way of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=153.22s)]
*  $14 billion in aid, and by way [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=155.22s)]
*  of rhetoric as well. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=158.22s)]
*  So we have the military support, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=162.22s)]
*  the diplomatic support, and so [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=163.22s)]
*  on, the political support. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=164.22s)]
*  And so that is what makes this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=166.22s)]
*  circumstance, the specific [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=170.22s)]
*  instance, so unique, so different [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=172.22s)]
*  than other instances where the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=174.22s)]
*  United States has provided [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=176.22s)]
*  unconditional support for Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=178.22s)]
*  Did you have an opportunity to [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=180.22s)]
*  sit down with the Biden [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=182.22s)]
*  administration? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=183.22s)]
*  I heard that you declined an [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=184.22s)]
*  invitation. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=185.22s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=186.22s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=188.22s)]
*  There was two separate. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=189.22s)]
*  I was asked to participate in a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=190.22s)]
*  roundtable with Arab members of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=192.22s)]
*  the Arab American and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=195.22s)]
*  Palestinian American community [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=197.22s)]
*  in the State Department. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=199.22s)]
*  I was also asked to participate [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=200.22s)]
*  in a later on at the height of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=202.22s)]
*  the attacks on Gaza at the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=204.22s)]
*  White House, which I declined [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=206.22s)]
*  because, frankly, it got to the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=208.22s)]
*  point where it was feeling [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=210.22s)]
*  performative and not really [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=212.22s)]
*  bearing any real results. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=214.22s)]
*  It was just something the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=216.22s)]
*  administration was doing to be [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=217.22s)]
*  able to allay fears and say, we [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=219.22s)]
*  hear you, we feel you, but they [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=221.22s)]
*  don't. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=223.22s)]
*  And the message has been [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=224.22s)]
*  delivered loud and clear that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=226.22s)]
*  they've lost our votes in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=227.22s)]
*  2024. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=229.22s)]
*  And these efforts, frankly, are [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=230.22s)]
*  falling flat amongst the Arab [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=232.22s)]
*  and Palestinian and Muslim [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=234.22s)]
*  communities in the United [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=236.22s)]
*  States. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=237.22s)]
*  I know that you met with [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=238.22s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=240.22s)]
*  in a setting, in a forum, and I [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=242.22s)]
*  wonder what were you able to say [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=244.22s)]
*  to him that you thought might [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=246.22s)]
*  have an effect? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=249.22s)]
*  This was very early on in [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=251.22s)]
*  Israel's assault on Gaza. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=255.22s)]
*  And really, I was hoping to use [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=257.22s)]
*  it as an opportunity to convey [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=260.22s)]
*  to him how I felt, how we felt [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=263.22s)]
*  as a Palestinian and a Muslim [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=266.22s)]
*  community. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=269.22s)]
*  I wanted to convey to him, I [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=270.22s)]
*  promised my cousins and my [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=272.22s)]
*  family in Gaza that I would [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=274.22s)]
*  convey their reality to him. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=277.22s)]
*  My main message to him was that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=279.22s)]
*  I was going to be a Muslim [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=282.22s)]
*  and I was going to be a Muslim [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=284.22s)]
*  to be able to convey to him. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=287.22s)]
*  My main message was that all [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=290.22s)]
*  we're hearing, all I'm hearing, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=292.22s)]
*  is that Palestinians are [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=294.22s)]
*  barbarians and baby killers and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=296.22s)]
*  the unhumans, to which the law [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=299.22s)]
*  of war did not apply, and that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=301.22s)]
*  my administration was okay with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=305.22s)]
*  that. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=307.22s)]
*  That was the message I wanted [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=308.22s)]
*  to convey to him. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=310.22s)]
*  how many Palestinians and how many children and women need to die [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=311.22s)]
*  before you are okay with finally calling for a ceasefire. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=317.94000000000005s)]
*  Of course, we discussed the fact that this was not self-defense. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=325.42s)]
*  When 75 percent of the victims have been women and children, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=329.58000000000004s)]
*  that is not only grossly disproportionate, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=335.38000000000005s)]
*  that's reprehensible to call it self-defense and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=338.14000000000004s)]
*  insist that there's no red lines for Israel as morally repugnant. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=340.58s)]
*  So those are really the messages we conveyed. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  And again, the main ask was the ceasefire. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=347.53999999999996s)]
*  Why do you think it is that calling for a ceasefire or a halt of hostilities, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=351.3s)]
*  or really however you want to phrase it, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=358.78s)]
*  because even it seems the phrasing matters, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=360.7s)]
*  why has that inherently become a political act or one that admits defeat for one side, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=363.14s)]
*  or the other? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=370.42s)]
*  I keep saying that ceasefire has somehow become a dirty word, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=371.42s)]
*  that you see our politicians literally engaging in verbal acrobatics [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=376.42s)]
*  just to be able to avoid saying it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=385.42s)]
*  And the message that we keep getting from them, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=388.42s)]
*  from different legislators that I've personally met with and officials, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=392.42s)]
*  is that, oh, it's going to be bad optics. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=395.42s)]
*  It's going to make it look like we're caving in. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=398.42s)]
*  And Biden even used that word. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=404.42s)]
*  He said we. He didn't say, excuse me, Israel. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=406.42s)]
*  Does that make, is he suggesting that the United States, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=409.42s)]
*  is he admitting that the United States is complicit in this? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=414.42s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=417.42s)]
*  But the fact remains that they consider a call for a ceasefire to be bad optics, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=418.42s)]
*  as though somehow Hamas would be winning, that they would be caving. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=425.42s)]
*  But the reality is, a large number of Israelis themselves are now calling for a ceasefire, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=430.42s)]
*  coming out and protesting, let alone Americans as well, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=439.42s)]
*  because there's no winners in this. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=443.42s)]
*  There's no winners in war. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=445.42s)]
*  So I wonder if, look, you're an author, you know the power of words and language, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=448.42s)]
*  and considering the emphasis you're putting on the way that the Biden administration [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=453.42s)]
*  is talking about Palestinians and about the conflict, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=459.42s)]
*  do condemnations matter? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=463.42s)]
*  And does it matter if President Biden condemns the actions of Israel, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=467.42s)]
*  or if you condemn the actions of Hamas? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=473.42s)]
*  I think it sends a strong message. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=478.42s)]
*  But I think what's more important, again, is actions. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=481.42s)]
*  You know, actions to me speak louder than words. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=486.42s)]
*  And the actions of our government so far have been subpar to nonexistent. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=490.42s)]
*  We've only heard over and over again that your lives as Palestinians [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=505.42s)]
*  simply matter less to us than the lives of Israelis. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=514.4200000000001s)]
*  And again, that messaging has a direct impact on our communities here in the United States. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=520.4200000000001s)]
*  Should Arab-American, Muslim-American organizations be condemning the actions of Hamas [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=530.42s)]
*  if they want the same condemnation back from the Biden administration [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=539.42s)]
*  towards the actions of Israel? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=544.42s)]
*  Do those messages matter, I guess, what I'm asking? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=547.42s)]
*  Our communities have always had to assume the burden of, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=551.42s)]
*  before even being asked about their loved ones and their families, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=559.42s)]
*  have always had to assume the burden of condemnation. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=565.42s)]
*  We've seen this happen over and over and over and over again, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=569.42s)]
*  not only in 9-11, but long before. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=574.42s)]
*  And I think the question that we need to ask is, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=578.42s)]
*  you know, and I should say, and they've always come out and said, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=587.42s)]
*  none of us condone violence. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=592.42s)]
*  Human life is precious. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=595.42s)]
*  But that's all anyone ever wants to hear from us. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=598.42s)]
*  They're not interested again. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=602.42s)]
*  They're not interested in our lives, our people, our rights. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=604.42s)]
*  They're just interested in hearing us condemn over and over and over again, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=611.42s)]
*  just sort of condition us into condemning. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=619.42s)]
*  And I think those two things should not be conditional. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=623.42s)]
*  Recently, the organization CARE, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=630.42s)]
*  which stands for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=634.42s)]
*  had put out some information that is quite distressing. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=638.42s)]
*  I just want to cite a couple of things. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=642.42s)]
*  They've received more than 1,200 calls for help. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=644.42s)]
*  This is in the context of the war that's happening right now. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=648.42s)]
*  And that's a 216% increase over the previous year. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=652.42s)]
*  And I think people are calling into this organization talking about [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=656.42s)]
*  anti-Arab bias in their lives. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=661.42s)]
*  And what's your reaction to that? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=664.42s)]
*  Have you been experiencing this? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=666.42s)]
*  Unfortunately, it doesn't surprise me. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=668.42s)]
*  I have personally experienced this. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=671.42s)]
*  I myself, along with my daughter, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=674.42s)]
*  I was attending a rally in Rockville, Maryland last week where a very [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=677.42s)]
*  violent rally was going on. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=682.42s)]
*  And that rally, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=684.42s)]
*  that rally was going on was a rally calling for a ceasefire where [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=685.42s)]
*  directly adjacent to us was a very vocal, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=689.42s)]
*  vitriolic counter protest that were shouting at us. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=692.42s)]
*  And as you can see, I'm very visibly Muslim. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=696.42s)]
*  Things like animals, barbarians. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=698.42s)]
*  We're going to take your heads, go back home. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=700.42s)]
*  Murderous Muslims will kill your brothers. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=704.42s)]
*  You're not welcome here. And on and on. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=706.42s)]
*  My own daughter experienced this when she was walking in Washington, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=708.42s)]
*  DC. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=711.42s)]
*  She was killed at her baby murder. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=712.42s)]
*  She has faced significant pushback out of her school here in Howard [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=718.42s)]
*  County, Maryland as well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=721.42s)]
*  And trying to organize something as simple as a walkout. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=723.42s)]
*  To call for a ceasefire. I've received hate mail. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=726.42s)]
*  In my actual mailbox. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=729.42s)]
*  Calling on Israel to kill every expletive. I don't want to say. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=734.42s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=738.42s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=739.42s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=741.42s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=743.42s)]
*  Threatening words saying to kill them all. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=745.42s)]
*  This has become unfortunately the new normal. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=747.42s)]
*  I should say abnormal in our lives. We remain vigilant. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=750.42s)]
*  But the unfortunate reality is at a time when I should be grieving my [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=754.42s)]
*  family and I've lost several. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=757.42s)]
*  Family members in Gaza, direct family, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=764.42s)]
*  I would say. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=765.42s)]
*  I would say that the real problem here. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=766.42s)]
*  Again, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=769.42s)]
*  is the way that the administration has gone about this and, and. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=770.42s)]
*  It's a direct result. I would say of the dehumanizing. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=774.42s)]
*  And racist rhetoric. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=777.42s)]
*  That Israel has been using to justify its massacres in Gaza that then [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=783.42s)]
*  our administration here. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=787.42s)]
*  Has essentially been promoting. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=788.42s)]
*  The. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=791.42s)]
*  The. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=792.42s)]
*  The. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=793.42s)]
*  Impact effect on not only Muslim Americans and Palestinians, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=794.42s)]
*  but as well as Arab Americans and a lot of people of color as well, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=798.42s)]
*  who are none of the above. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=801.42s)]
*  Why do you think it is that. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=802.42s)]
*  Muslim Americans. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=804.42s)]
*  End up being the targets. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=806.42s)]
*  I think the. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=808.42s)]
*  Unfortunate reality is that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=810.42s)]
*  While. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=814.42s)]
*  Hate attacks. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=815.42s)]
*  And hate rhetoric of any kind. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=817.42s)]
*  And I want to say that loud and clear. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=819.42s)]
*  It's my feeling that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=822.42s)]
*  Palestinian. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=824.42s)]
*  Arab Muslim lives. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=825.42s)]
*  Matter less. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=828.42s)]
*  To this administration. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=829.42s)]
*  And. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=831.42s)]
*  Are therefore. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=832.42s)]
*  Not. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=833.42s)]
*  Highlighted. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=834.42s)]
*  As much. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=835.42s)]
*  Than non Palestinian Arab and Muslim lives. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=838.42s)]
*  I think that a lot of it has to do with. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=842.42s)]
*  Othering. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=845.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=846.42s)]
*  It's it's this. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=847.42s)]
*  Idea also that. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=848.42s)]
*  You know, we're not a monolithic group. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=850.42s)]
*  When I say we. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=852.42s)]
*  Often what happens is when you have something. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=853.42s)]
*  When you have. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=856.42s)]
*  When you see something like what happened to Gaza. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=857.42s)]
*  And when you see this dehumanizing racist rhetoric being rolled out by the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=860.42s)]
*  Israelis. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=863.42s)]
*  That then. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=864.42s)]
*  Has a direct impact on media coverage. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=865.42s)]
*  And disinformation that is then repeated by our administration that has a [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=868.42s)]
*  direct impact. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=872.42s)]
*  On our communities here and our communities could be. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=873.42s)]
*  Palestinian. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=876.42s)]
*  Muslim or Christian. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=877.42s)]
*  It could be Arab non Palestinian. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=879.42s)]
*  And they could be brown people of color who aren't even Muslim at all. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=881.42s)]
*  I've had a lot of my friends from the South aging community here in Maryland. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=885.42s)]
*  Who are sick and others. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=889.42s)]
*  Who have been at the receiving end of hate attacks as well. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=891.42s)]
*  And so it's this othering. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=894.42s)]
*  I think. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=896.42s)]
*  That contributes to. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=897.42s)]
*  To. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=899.42s)]
*  This reality that you mentioned. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=900.42s)]
*  You were. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=902.42s)]
*  In the United States. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=903.42s)]
*  After 9 11. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=904.42s)]
*  And. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=906.42s)]
*  It seems that we're. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=907.42s)]
*  I'm going over some of those. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=909.42s)]
*  Same roads. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=911.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=912.42s)]
*  I was here during 9 11. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=913.42s)]
*  I was actually in Boston. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=915.42s)]
*  And I was a graduate student and. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=917.42s)]
*  They were terrifying times. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=920.42s)]
*  I won't lie, especially. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=921.42s)]
*  Especially. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=923.42s)]
*  For. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=924.42s)]
*  Muslims who were not. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=925.42s)]
*  US citizens. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=927.42s)]
*  It was difficult for us to. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=928.42s)]
*  But I felt particularly vulnerable as a stateless Palestinian. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=931.42s)]
*  And was myself detained and threatened with deportation to where I have no idea. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=934.42s)]
*  At some point while I was pregnant with my son in Logan airport. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=938.42s)]
*  I'll never forget those days ever. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=942.42s)]
*  And I, and I. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=944.42s)]
*  Tell that story to my children. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=945.42s)]
*  Over and over to teach them to be resilient, to teach them to speak out. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=947.42s)]
*  To teach them to seek due process. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=951.42s)]
*  I actually filed complaints to the police. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=953.42s)]
*  And I was. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=955.42s)]
*  And was. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=957.42s)]
*  And I, and I. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=958.42s)]
*  The message I give them, especially my daughter is. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=959.42s)]
*  The struggle is long and it is real and. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=962.42s)]
*  And it is necessary. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=965.42s)]
*  So don't give up and don't get too comfortable. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=966.42s)]
*  Because you have to. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=968.42s)]
*  is long and it is real and it is necessary. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=969.42s)]
*  So don't give up and don't get too comfortable [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=973.5s)]
*  because you have to not only speak out [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=976.0999999999999s)]
*  on behalf of yourself and your people, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=979.0999999999999s)]
*  but on anyone who is the victim of a grave injustice [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=981.4599999999999s)]
*  and of which there are many that our government here [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=985.5799999999999s)]
*  has perpetrated. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=988.0999999999999s)]
*  And so that's in summary the message I give her [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=990.5799999999999s)]
*  without victimizing her in any way [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=994.54s)]
*  or giving her this mentality that she somehow [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=996.74s)]
*  somehow a victim. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=999.54s)]
*  But to be vigilant and to be alert and to be vocal [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1000.78s)]
*  and to advocate for herself and for others. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1003.42s)]
*  You've called this time period your daughter's 911. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1005.86s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1009.42s)]
*  I think this really hit home for her for the first time, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1010.34s)]
*  meaning what was happening to Gaza [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1014.78s)]
*  and to her family in Gaza [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1017.58s)]
*  and how that was directly related to herself here [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1019.66s)]
*  as a young Palestinian, visibly Muslim American. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1024.1399999999999s)]
*  And so I call it her coming of age moment [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1028.58s)]
*  in the sense that she was suddenly in the throes [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1030.58s)]
*  of all of this at the receiving end of hateful vitriol [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1032.6999999999998s)]
*  that was being hurled at her [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1037.6599999999999s)]
*  at the receiving end of intimidating tactics [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1039.54s)]
*  as she was trying to do something as simple as, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1042.1s)]
*  you know, call for an end to hostilities. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1045.22s)]
*  And she couldn't believe that this was happening. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1047.46s)]
*  And I, you know, I didn't want to tell her, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1051.34s)]
*  well, welcome to the club, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1054.26s)]
*  but that's why I call it her coming of age moment. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1055.22s)]
*  She suddenly realized this is real [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1057.18s)]
*  and there are real threats. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1061.14s)]
*  And, you know, people will say things to her [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1062.42s)]
*  that are mean and hateful and try to silence her [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1066.42s)]
*  when she simply tries to speak out [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1070.22s)]
*  in support of freedom and equality for her people. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1072.0600000000002s)]
*  So this is the unfortunate reality we live in. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1075.42s)]
*  But again, it's a moment that I hope she will learn from [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1079.74s)]
*  and, you know, a teachable moment. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1085.7s)]
*  It's unfortunate that it had to come in this way. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1087.9s)]
*  And I don't wish that upon anyone, obviously. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1091.14s)]
*  Palestinian author and activist, Laila Al-Haddad, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1093.94s)]
*  thanks so much for joining us. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1096.22s)]
*  It was my pleasure, thank you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNF7-o6rSg4&t=1097.42s)]
