*  You have a recent report out [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=28.9s)]
*  that showed that the Israeli [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=30.74s)]
*  government was working with [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=33.0s)]
*  groups to target U.S. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=34.6s)]

*  Explain. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=40.4s)]
*  So this was a campaign that ran [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=42.34s)]
*  just in the weeks following [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=44.4s)]
*  October 7th, and it was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=45.54s)]
*  organized by the Israeli [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=47.5s)]
*  Ministry of Diaspora Affairs. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  It was seen as an effort to try [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=51.34s)]
*  and get more Americans, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=52.8s)]
*  specifically American lawmakers, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=54.0s)]
*  on board with Israel's point of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=56.04s)]
*  view regarding the war, and they [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=57.7s)]
*  used these fake accounts that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=58.900000000000006s)]
*  essentially posted as college [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=60.7s)]
*  students or parents on Facebook, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=62.5s)]
*  Twitter, Instagram, and, you [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=65.04s)]
*  know, just filled the comment [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=67.64s)]
*  section of some of these members [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  of Congress with comments like, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=69.9s)]
*  well, you know, do you know this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=71.34s)]
*  about the U.N.? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=72.44s)]
*  Or are you aware about Israel's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=73.34s)]
*  history about this particular [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=74.88s)]
*  thing? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=76.54s)]
*  Just trying to kind of sow a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  narrative that they hoped would [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=78.54s)]
*  sway these members of Congress. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=80.14s)]
*  So were there human beings [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=81.80000000000001s)]
*  behind each of those accounts, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=82.94s)]
*  even though that might not be [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=84.28s)]
*  their identity, or was this a [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=85.48s)]
*  combination of A.I. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  use as well? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=88.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, in some ways, it [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=90.18s)]
*  was a really innovative [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=91.28s)]
*  campaign in that while they were [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=92.12s)]
*  human beings that were making [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=93.58000000000001s)]
*  the top line decisions about who [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=94.94000000000001s)]
*  gets targeted or what kind [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  of messaging they use, the actual [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=98.84s)]
*  words, the text were being [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  generated by A.I., [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=102.54s)]
*  specifically by chat GPT. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=104.12s)]
*  And so it's the kind of program [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=106.42s)]
*  where you can put in, you know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=107.72s)]
*  give me two sentences that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=109.48s)]
*  would give the Israeli point of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=111.34s)]
*  view or pro-Israel perspective [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=112.68s)]
*  on this moment in history. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=114.54s)]
*  And that chat program will write [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=116.04s)]
*  it for you and it'll try to make [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=117.98s)]
*  it sound authentic. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  And if you're not a native [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  English speaker, that's a pretty [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  good workaround to try and get [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=123.72s)]
*  some text that you can then copy [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=125.12s)]
*  and paste into Facebook, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  Instagram or Twitter. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=128.38s)]
*  OK, so how widespread was this [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=129.84s)]
*  campaign? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=132.44s)]
*  Do we have any idea of how much [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=133.04000000000002s)]
*  money was spent on it or how [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=134.28s)]
*  many different accounts were [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=135.78s)]
*  talking about? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=136.62s)]
*  So some of the internal emails [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=138.18s)]
*  that we were given named a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=139.84s)]
*  budget of up to two million [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=141.28s)]
*  dollars, that's as much as we [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=142.68s)]
*  know. We don't know how much was [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=145.42s)]
*  spent. We know that that was [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=146.55999999999997s)]
*  what they kind of dedicated [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=147.76s)]
*  towards it and the kind of thing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  that that a lot of private [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  companies are running now. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=152.06s)]
*  And so we see some of these [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  companies offering to run [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  campaigns for as little as fifteen [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=156.42s)]
*  twenty thousand dollars up to the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=158.1s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=159.6s)]
*  And who were the targets? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  I mean, were there specific [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=162.66s)]
*  individuals that were, you know, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  on important subcommittees or is [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=165.45999999999998s)]
*  this just kind of a blanket [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=167.2s)]
*  towards all members of Congress? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=168.76s)]
*  We did see them targeting a few [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=171.32s)]
*  members of Congress more [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  in a more concentrated way than [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=175.1s)]
*  others. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=176.64s)]
*  You know, for instance, they seem [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=178.34s)]
*  to be particularly interested in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=179.5s)]
*  black, democratic members of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=181.08s)]
*  Congress. And we saw quite a few [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=182.58s)]
*  of those members of Congress [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=183.84s)]
*  receiving a greater percentage of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=185.18s)]
*  the comments on their Facebook [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=187.08s)]
*  pages and on their Twitter [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=188.14s)]
*  accounts. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=189.1s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=189.88s)]
*  types of posts that were being [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=191.28s)]
*  created in this campaign. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=193.98s)]
*  What would they say? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=195.6s)]
*  So some of the posts were [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=197.5s)]
*  imitating college students just [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=199.98s)]
*  saying, I go to college at [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=201.5s)]
*  X University at NYU or wherever [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=203.38s)]
*  and facing anti-Semitism. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=205.72s)]
*  And this is the reality of being [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=207.48s)]
*  a college student today. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=208.92s)]
*  And some of the posts [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  just kind of pointed to Wall [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  Street Journal articles, for [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=213.82s)]
*  instance, that described the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=214.82s)]
*  UN hiring members of Hamas to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=216.76s)]
*  work for their organization in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  Gaza. So it was a range of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=219.88s)]
*  postings, but all of them kind of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=222.85999999999999s)]
*  promoting the Israeli narrative [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=224.88s)]
*  about why they're in war, why [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  they're at war in Gaza and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=228.76s)]
*  why they feel they should [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=230.82s)]
*  continue to be at war there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  And was any of this [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=233.38s)]
*  specifically disinformation or [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=235.72s)]
*  filled with something that was [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=237.82s)]
*  not factual? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=238.96s)]
*  So most of what we saw [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=241.16s)]
*  was it's hard, you know, I [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=243.66s)]
*  think in this particular [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=245.85999999999999s)]
*  conflict, there are people who [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=247.06s)]
*  choose certain sets of facts to [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=249.26s)]
*  support their position. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  And so a lot of what we saw was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=252.22s)]
*  the pushing of narratives that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=253.72s)]
*  they felt were more favorable [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=255.26s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=257.26s)]
*  So, for instance, taking news [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  articles that have been written [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=260.02s)]
*  in some outlets and then [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=261.12s)]
*  regurgitating them and saying, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=262.96s)]
*  well, don't you see the Israeli [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  point of view on this regarding [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=265.14s)]
*  hostages or regarding the way [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  the UN has some issues in the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=268.64s)]
*  way it functions in Gaza? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=270.4s)]
*  The portrayal of who was [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  behind the accounts was the part [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=274.2s)]
*  that was fake and that they were [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=275.7s)]
*  pretending to be American [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  college students with who were [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=278.35999999999996s)]
*  facing anti-Semitism on campus, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=280.2s)]
*  for instance. So they would take [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=281.7s)]
*  something that's that's likely [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  true. There have been American [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=284.46s)]
*  students that have talked about [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=285.64s)]
*  facing anti-Semitism on college [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=286.9s)]
*  campuses, but they would pose as [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=288.46s)]
*  these students and pretend as if [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=290.46s)]
*  it had happened to them [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=292.2s)]
*  specifically. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  Is there any way to measure, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=294.94s)]
*  I guess, whether it's sentiment [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=297.7s)]
*  analysis or whether it's the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=299.0s)]
*  number of likes or retweets, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=301.0s)]
*  what the reach was of this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=303.4s)]
*  campaign? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=305.38s)]
*  So I think only the company is [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=306.7s)]
*  only meta and Twitter can really [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=308.48s)]
*  tell us how many people saw [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=310.3s)]
*  these tweets, interacted with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=312.38s)]
*  them. The ones I saw did not [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=313.53999999999996s)]
*  seem to be particularly [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=315.88s)]
*  effective. In fact, there were a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=316.98s)]
*  couple of times on Twitter where [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=318.53999999999996s)]
*  I would see one of these fake [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=319.9s)]
*  bot accounts writing something [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=321.08s)]
*  and then just underneath it, it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=322.38s)]
*  would say, this doesn't sound [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=323.56s)]
*  real. This sounds like a bot, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  like this. This doesn't sound [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=326.46s)]
*  like a human being. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=327.56s)]
*  So I think meta and Twitter [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  have kind of raised their [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=330.97999999999996s)]
*  eyebrows a bit and said, we [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=332.32s)]
*  don't we don't know if this was [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=333.32s)]
*  very effective. We don't we don't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=334.56s)]
*  think it was. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  But it's the kind of thing that's [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  really hard to actually do a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=338.08s)]
*  thorough analysis on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=339.28s)]
*  And how long had Metta or [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=340.76s)]
*  I guess now X known [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  about these kinds of campaigns [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=346.06s)]
*  or accounts and did they do [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=348.38s)]
*  anything about it? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=350.32s)]
*  So Metta regularly publishes [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=351.86s)]
*  reports about these kinds of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=353.92s)]
*  campaigns. They call them [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=355.4s)]
*  coordinated inauthentic behavior. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=356.62s)]
*  What it means is basically like a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=358.3s)]
*  country or a company is running [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=359.46s)]
*  some kind of campaign on [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=361.32s)]
*  either Facebook or Instagram. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=363.3s)]
*  And so we have a pretty good [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=364.92s)]
*  sense of how regularly Metta [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=366.3s)]
*  takes these down. And there's [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=367.9s)]
*  just there's lots of them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=369.06s)]
*  I'd say every three months we [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=370.9s)]
*  hear about a good six or seven [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=372.2s)]
*  of these campaigns. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=373.4s)]
*  We we don't know about Twitter. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=374.52s)]
*  Twitter used to disclose in a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=376.2s)]
*  similar in a similar kind of [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=377.56s)]
*  report. But since the company [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=378.86s)]
*  was taken over by Elon Musk, we [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=381.26s)]
*  don't have that same visibility. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=382.64s)]
*  And so we're not sure how many of [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  these campaigns they're now [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=385.66s)]
*  finding. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=386.54s)]
*  As long as there have been war, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=387.3s)]
*  there have been sort of propaganda [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=388.46000000000004s)]
*  campaigns to try to justify the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  war or actions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  And so that's not particularly [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=393.64s)]
*  new. And we know that governments [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=395.26s)]
*  have been trying to influence [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=396.94s)]
*  actions by members of Congress, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=399.04s)]
*  say, around a U.S. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=400.96000000000004s)]
*  election or around January 6th. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=402.14s)]
*  So what was different? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=404.1s)]
*  What was intriguing to you this [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=405.16s)]
*  time about what Israel [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  was doing? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=408.5s)]
*  You know, I've covered [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=409.88s)]
*  misinformation, disinformation, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=411.04s)]
*  influence campaigns really since [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=413.0s)]
*  2016. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=414.74s)]
*  This was really unique in that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=416.14s)]
*  while we see these campaigns all [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=418.44s)]
*  the time and, you know, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=420.18s)]
*  Iran, China, Russia, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=422.1s)]
*  the United States, they all do [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=424.04s)]
*  this. This is just part of modern [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=425.88s)]
*  warfare. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=427.48s)]
*  It's really, really unusual for [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=428.28s)]
*  us to be able to document it from [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=430.28s)]
*  start to finish. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=431.84s)]
*  And so through reporting, I went [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=433.14s)]
*  to Israel several times. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=434.88s)]
*  I spoke to members of government [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=435.98s)]
*  there. I spoke to people at these [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=437.34s)]
*  companies like Metta. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=438.64s)]
*  We were able to see from start to [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=440.84s)]
*  finish how a campaign began. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=442.32s)]
*  A couple of people having an idea [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=444.23999999999995s)]
*  of let's target these members of [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=446.11999999999995s)]
*  Congress. Here's how we're going [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=447.44s)]
*  to pay for it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=448.44s)]
*  Here's what members of you know, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=449.62s)]
*  we had we got a rare chance to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=451.28s)]
*  kind of see the nuts and bolts of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=452.67999999999995s)]
*  how these campaigns unfold. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=454.14s)]
*  And that we very rarely get a [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=455.94s)]
*  chance to see. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=457.73999999999995s)]
*  I wonder what was the reaction [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=458.58s)]
*  from members of the Israeli [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  government when you are pointing [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=462.38s)]
*  this out, saying, hey, we have [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=464.02s)]

*  your reporting? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=509.64s)]

*  them talking about their use of [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=520.74s)]
*  A.I. was also taken down. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=522.1s)]
*  They're a private Israeli company [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=524.3s)]
*  who advertise kind of political [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=526.4s)]
*  campaigns and on [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=528.34s)]
*  their own LinkedIn page, they [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=530.24s)]

*  to run campaigns. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=532.64s)]
*  So the official Israeli response [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=534.96s)]
*  says that they deny this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=537.1s)]
*  The company that was [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=538.96s)]
*  kind of at the center of this [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=540.96s)]
*  campaign, they've kind of gone [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=542.0s)]
*  dark and they're not responding [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=543.5s)]
*  to you. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=544.9s)]
*  But there are members of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=545.86s)]
*  the Israeli government who are [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=548.26s)]
*  concerned about this, right? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=549.76s)]
*  Yes. And I'll note that in the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=552.1s)]
*  course of my reporting, I was [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=553.56s)]
*  shown emails. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=555.4599999999999s)]
*  I was shown messages from within [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=556.3399999999999s)]

*  You know, it's it is in the midst [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=561.04s)]
*  of war and there are a lot of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=562.6999999999999s)]
*  different ministries, a lot of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  different groups were meeting to [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=565.4599999999999s)]
*  discuss how to advance Israel's [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=566.76s)]
*  agenda. And I think the lingering [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=568.14s)]
*  question that that I've heard [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  from many members of the Israeli [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=571.66s)]
*  government is how high up did it [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=572.8s)]
*  go and exactly who ordered this [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=574.06s)]
*  type of campaign to happen? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=575.8599999999999s)]
*  Are there ways to figure out [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  how these different types of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=579.16s)]
*  influence campaigns, you know, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=581.34s)]
*  are we only going to find out [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=584.12s)]
*  after the fact if we get lucky, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=586.0400000000001s)]
*  if some sources start to leak [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  information or are there ways [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=589.48s)]
*  for us to see in closer [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=591.62s)]
*  to real time? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=593.9200000000001s)]
*  Hey, we're being manipulated here [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=595.2800000000001s)]
*  that there's a concerted effort. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, I'll take this [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=599.9200000000001s)]
*  campaign as an example. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=601.24s)]
*  In real time, people were [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  responding to some of these [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=604.58s)]
*  accounts and saying this doesn't [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=605.52s)]
*  feel real. This language feels [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=606.98s)]
*  silted. I just I'm not buying [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=608.34s)]
*  it was kind of the response [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=610.24s)]
*  that many people had on Twitter [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=611.94s)]
*  and on Facebook and Instagram. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=613.1800000000001s)]
*  And so I do think that in real [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=614.92s)]
*  time, you sometimes just have [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=616.82s)]
*  that sense that something's [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=618.34s)]
*  fishy. But to prove something [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=619.38s)]
*  as a campaign takes months and [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=621.54s)]
*  months of research. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=623.1800000000001s)]
*  And the number of people that are [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=624.38s)]
*  dedicated to doing this research [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=625.54s)]
*  is quite small. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=626.98s)]
*  So we certainly don't hear about [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=628.14s)]
*  every single campaign that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=629.58s)]
*  happens. And it takes the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=630.94s)]
*  companies, Metta, X, Twitter, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=631.94s)]
*  et cetera. It takes them even [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=634.08s)]
*  longer to come out with their [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=635.64s)]
*  reports when these campaigns [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=636.74s)]
*  happen. So we do see quite a bit [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=637.84s)]
*  of a lag or a delay about this [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=639.34s)]
*  type of activity. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=641.4200000000001s)]
*  What surprised you about the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=643.32s)]
*  internal communications, the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=644.5400000000001s)]
*  emails that you saw about the [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=645.84s)]
*  impetus for this? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=648.22s)]
*  That I guess the I mean, just [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=649.48s)]
*  just how they were thinking [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=651.72s)]
*  about this process? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=652.72s)]
*  You know, not I wouldn't say [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=655.5400000000001s)]
*  that they necessarily surprised [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=656.74s)]
*  me and that what they were [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=658.08s)]
*  after seemed quite typical of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=658.94s)]
*  these kinds of campaigns. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=661.62s)]
*  Let's try to influence a member [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=662.62s)]
*  of Congress. Let's try to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=664.0400000000001s)]
*  influence the American public. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=665.08s)]
*  That's something every country [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=666.4200000000001s)]
*  wants to do in modern warfare. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=668.02s)]
*  For me, as a reporter, it's just [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=670.86s)]
*  always super interesting to get [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  that moment of like, oh, it was [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=673.46s)]
*  paid for by the government. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=675.0s)]
*  It was actually, in fact, part of [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=676.3s)]
*  a an agenda that was set by the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=678.06s)]
*  Israeli government. It's [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=680.1s)]
*  something we often suspect with [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=680.8199999999999s)]
*  these kinds of campaigns when we [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=682.42s)]
*  try to figure out who's [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=683.72s)]
*  dedicating money to them. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=685.26s)]
*  But we very rarely get that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=686.86s)]
*  inside look. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=688.16s)]
*  Do we have any idea whether [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  this campaign is over, whether [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=692.76s)]
*  it's been stopped? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=694.86s)]
*  So I've been looking at some of [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=696.86s)]
*  the accounts that were associated [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=698.2s)]
*  with it, and as far as I can tell, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=699.5600000000001s)]
*  META removed all of them from [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=700.74s)]
*  Facebook and Instagram. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=702.44s)]
*  X, the company formerly known as [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=704.76s)]
*  Twitter, has removed some of [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=706.2s)]
*  those accounts, but I actually [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=707.64s)]
*  just checked yesterday and I saw [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=709.24s)]
*  one or two of them still active. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=710.54s)]
*  I see them tweeting at [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=711.96s)]
*  posting at members of Congress. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=714.26s)]
*  Those members of Congress don't [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=715.9s)]
*  seem to be responding. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=717.04s)]
*  And, you know, the lines are [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=719.36s)]
*  quite the same. I think one thing [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=720.74s)]
*  that everyone should keep in mind [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=722.66s)]
*  is that in almost every single [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=723.76s)]
*  one of these campaigns that's [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=724.96s)]
*  been run in the past by Russia, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=726.1s)]
*  Iran, China, even when [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=728.0600000000001s)]
*  the accounts are taken down, it's [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  pretty much whack-a-mole and [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=731.36s)]
*  they're back within sometimes [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=732.8000000000001s)]
*  within days, sometimes within [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  weeks, within months, with a [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  slightly handle, with a slightly [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=736.94s)]
*  different AI generated profile [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=738.6s)]
*  pick. So it's [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=740.64s)]
*  very, very unusual for these [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=742.84s)]
*  accounts to be taken down and to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=744.46s)]
*  go away forever because there's [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=745.74s)]
*  honestly just too much money and [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=747.2s)]
*  interest in keeping these types [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=748.7s)]
*  of influence operations alive. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=749.9000000000001s)]
*  So if this campaign had targeted [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=752.1s)]
*  members of Congress in specific, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=754.16s)]
*  did it work? I mean, what was the [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=756.26s)]
*  response? What has been any [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=757.26s)]
*  of the response from members of [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=759.36s)]
*  Congress that might have been [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=760.56s)]
*  targeted? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=761.74s)]
*  So we haven't seen a lot of these [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=763.3s)]
*  members of Congress responding [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=764.56s)]
*  directly to the bots themselves [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=765.9s)]
*  on Twitter. And we didn't [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=767.8s)]
*  manage to speak to any of them [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=769.6s)]
*  before the story published. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=770.66s)]
*  But there was one member of [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=771.86s)]
*  Congress, Richie Torres, who did [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  tweet in response to the article [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=774.4399999999999s)]
*  calling the people behind the [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=776.4s)]
*  campaign blithering idiots and [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=777.64s)]
*  saying that they needed to be [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=779.6s)]
*  examined for their role in all of [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=780.74s)]
*  this. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=782.4599999999999s)]
*  There was just a recent Republican [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=783.14s)]
*  leadership, Mike McCall, Mike [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=785.06s)]
*  Turner, you know, said that Russian [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=787.8599999999999s)]
*  propaganda has infiltrated their [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=789.4399999999999s)]
*  party. And I wonder, is there any [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=790.7399999999999s)]
*  method? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=792.7399999999999s)]
*  Is there a place for government [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=794.0s)]
*  or anything government can do to [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=796.2399999999999s)]
*  try to decrease the influence [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=797.6999999999999s)]
*  operations from other countries? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=800.16s)]
*  You know, there was a period of [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=803.0s)]
*  time following the 2016 [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=803.9599999999999s)]
*  elections where we actually saw [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=806.42s)]
*  several members of government [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=808.3s)]
*  largely in the national security [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  sphere talking about, let's get [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=811.64s)]
*  organized on this. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=813.24s)]
*  Let's fund researchers [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=814.14s)]
*  that can help us with this kind of [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=816.28s)]
*  work. Let's put together an [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=817.58s)]
*  internal group within government [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=818.98s)]
*  that can come up with [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=820.4s)]
*  recommendations. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=821.0s)]
*  We also saw the highly unusual [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=822.08s)]
*  step of the U.S. government [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=823.64s)]
*  taking action against specific [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=824.64s)]
*  Russian hackers that were involved [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=826.34s)]
*  in the 2016 [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=827.96s)]
*  elections to the campaign, sorry, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=830.44s)]
*  to sway American voters in that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=832.34s)]
*  election. So there have been [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=833.8000000000001s)]
*  moments in time where the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=835.1s)]
*  government's shown more of an [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=835.96s)]
*  interest in acting. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=837.76s)]
*  I would say that in recent years, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=839.96s)]
*  that's kind of dropped off and we [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=841.44s)]
*  have fewer researchers and [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=843.12s)]
*  certainly it seems fewer [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=844.7600000000001s)]
*  bodies within government that [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=846.6800000000001s)]
*  seem to be working in a concerted [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=848.1800000000001s)]
*  effort to make sure that at the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=849.7600000000001s)]
*  very least foreign nations are [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=850.7600000000001s)]
*  not trying to influence Americans. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=852.6400000000001s)]
*  How significant has this conflict [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=856.0s)]
*  been when it comes to [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=858.0s)]
*  misinformation and disinformation? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=858.96s)]
*  How do we, you know, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=860.6400000000001s)]
*  how do we even start to measure [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=862.44s)]
*  the amount of [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=865.08s)]
*  kind of paid for influence that's [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=867.08s)]
*  in the social kind of ecosystems? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=869.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, at the very start of the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=872.44s)]
*  war, we did a story looking at how [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=873.84s)]
*  countries including Iran, Russia, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=875.84s)]
*  and China were using the events in [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=877.74s)]
*  Israel and Gaza to push their own [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=879.4000000000001s)]
*  narratives. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=880.8000000000001s)]
*  So for Iran, it was a way to [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  push a narrative that the U.S. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=883.6400000000001s)]
*  and Israel, we united fronts and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=885.6400000000001s)]
*  that by opposing Zionism, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=887.34s)]
*  you were opposing American [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=889.2s)]
*  imperialism. Russia took a [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=890.24s)]
*  fairly similar line. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=892.36s)]
*  China, slightly adjacent. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=893.8000000000001s)]
*  They kind of spoke more about [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=895.1600000000001s)]
*  American imperialism globally. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=896.5200000000001s)]
*  And so you saw a number of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=898.44s)]
*  countries kind of using this [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=899.7s)]
*  moment in time, this this ongoing [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=901.1999999999999s)]
*  conflict. I myself have covered [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=903.12s)]
*  the last three wars that have been [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=905.28s)]
*  fought between Israel and Gaza and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=906.5999999999999s)]
*  every single war, we have seen [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=908.3199999999999s)]
*  more and more misinformation [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=910.12s)]
*  swirling around it. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=912.16s)]
*  Not I was no, not actually [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=913.48s)]
*  necessarily between Israelis and [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=915.52s)]
*  Palestinians. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=917.0s)]
*  When I look for it in Arabic or [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=917.9599999999999s)]
*  Hebrew, it's not nearly [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=919.28s)]
*  anyone here. I would say the amount [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=921.52s)]
*  that I'm seeing in English and in [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=922.92s)]
*  other languages. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=924.04s)]
*  So the interest of groups all [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  over the world to use this this [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=927.0799999999999s)]
*  ongoing conflict for their own [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  agendas is certainly increased [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=930.08s)]
*  in in recent years. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=932.04s)]
*  And I think, you know, likely to [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=934.16s)]
*  the great detriment of people that [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=935.92s)]
*  are there. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=937.12s)]
*  One of the things that I mentioned [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=938.16s)]
*  to friends about social media [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=939.84s)]
*  is if something makes your blood [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=941.68s)]
*  boil, just, you know, take a deep [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=942.96s)]
*  breath, don't start sharing it [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=944.04s)]
*  right away. I wonder, it seems [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=945.56s)]
*  like the there is [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=947.52s)]
*  a formula that outside [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=949.4s)]
*  actors know almost how [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=951.68s)]
*  to reverse engineer the algorithm [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=953.56s)]
*  and say, OK, well, let's create [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=955.08s)]
*  this type of content. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=956.52s)]
*  Let's make it as incendiary as [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=957.84s)]
*  possible. Let's make sure that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=959.48s)]
*  people get their blood boiling. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=961.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=962.2s)]
*  But this sort of the this [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=963.24s)]
*  is a little bit more nuanced. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=965.12s)]
*  It's not just trying to [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=966.4s)]
*  really get you irate and fill [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=968.28s)]
*  you with anger. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=970.16s)]
*  It's just this seems like [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=971.44s)]
*  a more targeted approach [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=973.32s)]
*  when it's trying to [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=975.44s)]
*  be pervasive in the members of [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=977.44s)]
*  Congress's minds. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=979.2s)]
*  It is, although it will also prey [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=981.44s)]
*  on their emotions. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=983.24s)]
*  And I think that is basic [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=984.0s)]
*  human psychology is you're going [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=986.12s)]
*  to share something that that hits [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=987.8000000000001s)]
*  out at you. So if you're a member [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=989.24s)]
*  of Congress and someone claims [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=990.36s)]
*  to be from your district and says [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=992.2s)]
*  that they're a college student [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  and that they as an individual are [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=995.12s)]
*  facing anti-Semitism on campus, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=996.64s)]
*  that that could pull at your heart [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=998.36s)]
*  strings. Right. That can make you [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=999.76s)]
*  feel badly for what's happening for [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1000.92s)]
*  that specific individual in that [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1002.64s)]
*  moment in time. And then they call [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1004.08s)]
*  on you to continue funding [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1005.76s)]
*  Israel's war effort or they call [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1006.88s)]
*  on you to continue supporting [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1008.48s)]
*  Israel's [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1009.5600000000001s)]
*  position in the war. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1011.52s)]
*  I mean, they do prey on emotions. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1012.32s)]
*  And that's just because that's [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1014.96s)]
*  what works on social media, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1016.2s)]
*  appealing to a person's emotion has [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1017.88s)]
*  been shown time and time again to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1019.64s)]
*  work across social media, whether [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1021.12s)]
*  you're a human being trying to sell [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1022.9200000000001s)]
*  something at a garage sale or [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1024.8400000000001s)]
*  an influence campaign, trying to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1026.6000000000001s)]
*  move a member of Congress. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q8twEnLnjI&t=1028.0s)]
