Video Description: This conversation took place earlier today.

A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah may be within reach. An address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lays out the terms, which call for a 60-day pause in hostilities to set the stage for a lasting truce. The U.S. helped to broker the agreement, and a spokesman for the right-wing Likud party says the party has approved it. Israel has been pounding what it says are Hezbollah targets in a series of airstrikes in and around the Lebanese capital. Hezbollah also has been firing into Israel. Lebanon's government has agreed to the U.S.-backed proposal, after the speaker of Lebanese Parliament Nabih Berry received Hezbollah's approval to move forward. Elias Bou Saab is the deputy speaker of Lebanon's parliament, and he joins Christiane from Beirut.

# Deputy Speaker of Lebanese Parliament Discusses Israel-Hezbollah Ceasefire  Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890)
*  Deputy Speaker, welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=0.0s)]
*  Can I ask you how close you think this actually is? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=3.0s)]
*  Thank you, Christian, for having me on the show. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=9.0s)]
*  I think we are very close. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=13.0s)]
*  We are probably, you know, minutes of an announcement that may take place now in Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=15.0s)]
*  And later on, we're expecting a statement by the president of the United States and the president of France. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=22.0s)]
*  A joint statement, maybe, to announce the deal. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=28.0s)]
*  And after that, we will expect a statement from the Lebanese government. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=31.0s)]
*  And hopefully, this ceasefire will take effect 12 hours from now or from when it's announced, if things continue to go in the direction that we understand it to be. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=37.0s)]
*  Because historically, we had different experiences with Netanyahu. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=49.0s)]
*  Those experiences were not encouraging. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=54.0s)]
*  We don't know if this is going to happen for sure or something may change the last minute. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=57.0s)]
*  So we are skeptical here in Lebanon because of the bad experiences we had in the past. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=63.0s)]
*  And of course, you mentioned France. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=67.0s)]
*  They also help broker this with the United States. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=69.0s)]
*  But let me ask you, there's been a lot said and I said that part of this deal could be a 60-day pause in anticipation of a more permanent truce. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=72.0s)]
*  Can you give us, first of all, confirm whether that's the case and give us more of the details? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=81.0s)]
*  What will this truce or this agreement or arrangement look like? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=86.0s)]
*  There are several points, but the main important ones, Christiane, would be the minute this is announced. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=91.0s)]
*  Last I had the information was 12 hours from announcement the ceasefire will take effect. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=99.0s)]
*  And we probably call it halt of operation or, you know, military operation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=107.0s)]
*  Because this term was used in 1701 in the United Nations, you know, law that was passed on Lebanon, which was back in 2006 after the war of 2006. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=114.0s)]
*  So we say halt of operation, halt of military operation, and then we have 60 days period to implement the terms of this agreement. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=130.0s)]
*  It all focuses around 1701. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=140.0s)]
*  1701 clearly states that there should be immediate withdrawal of all Israeli soldiers from any territory they may have entered or occupied during that war. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=144.0s)]
*  And they are currently at the border in some villages or areas in the southern part of Lebanon. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=157.0s)]
*  So this will happen within the 60 days. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=164.0s)]
*  It will start being, you know, it's hard to be implemented immediately. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=167.0s)]
*  But we have up to 60 days to complete that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=172.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=174.0s)]
*  After this, the Lebanese army will start filling in. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=175.0s)]
*  So at any place that the Israelis leave, the Lebanese army will enter and the Lebanese army will have a major role together with UNIFIL to fill in the positions that were, you know, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=179.0s)]
*  left by the Israeli soldiers. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=193.0s)]
*  So just to ask. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=195.0s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=197.0s)]
*  I was going to ask you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=199.0s)]
*  Israeli forces, you say, are due to pull back, but so too Hezbollah forces, correct? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=200.0s)]
*  There's a number of kilometers. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=206.0s)]
*  This is what I was reaching. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=208.0s)]
*  The 1701 also calls that anything, this or all areas, the southern of the Litani River, on the south of the Litani River, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=210.0s)]
*  there should be no arms, no, you know, no rockets and no military presence for Hezbollah. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=220.0s)]
*  So also after the withdrawal of the Israelis and the Lebanese army enters that area, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=227.0s)]
*  we expect also that all the arms, if they exist and all the rockets where they exist in that part of the Litani River should be withdrawn or, you know, find a solution to it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=234.0s)]
*  This will take place, of course, also within the 60 days. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=249.0s)]
*  The 1701 also talks about other things, talks about, you know, we need to reach a point in the end where we stable the region, stable that border. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=254.0s)]
*  And then the negotiation as part of that agreement that we are expecting to see is that we will see the final demarcation of the land boundary between Lebanon and Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=265.0s)]
*  There are some points that are still, you know, being discussed since 2006. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=278.0s)]
*  We never finalized those. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=286.0s)]
*  We expect that this time there will be a follow up and finalization to all pending issues. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=288.0s)]
*  The difference between what is happening now and what happened in 2006, it's the same 1701. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=295.0s)]
*  But because it was never implemented by Israel or by Lebanon, this time we are hoping that there will be a new committee or a committee that existed between Lebanon, Israel and the United Nation that was meeting on regular basis in the South. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=301.0s)]
*  Now we will add to that committee the United States and France. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=317.0s)]
*  And whenever they meet, the United States will preside at those meetings. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=322.0s)]
*  So this will be a committee that will, if you want, oversee and monitor the implementation of that agreement. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcT6svlU890&t=328.0s)]
