Video Description: A key power player in the Middle East conflict is Iran -- a major backer of both Hezbollah and Hamas, and the country that Israel considers to be its arch foe in the region. This week in New York, Iran's president seemed to present a more moderate face to the world, suggesting a resumption of nuclear talks in an effort to get relief from sanctions. Iran's new Vice President for Strategic Affairs, Javad Zarif, is familiar to many from his time negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal as Foreign Minister. Zarif sat down with Christiane in New York for a wide-ranging interview on Lebanon, Gaza, a new nuclear deal with the United States and women's rights at home.

# Iranian VP for Strategic Affairs Weighs in on Israel, Gaza, and Lebanon | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ)
*  Iran has exercised restraint when Israel conducted military operations against Iran, conducted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  terrorist operations, killing the leader of Hamas, who was attending the inauguration [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=9.44s)]
*  of our president of all things, and we exercised restraint. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=17.6s)]
*  We believe that Tazvala is capable of defending itself. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=21.8s)]
*  It has been exercising restraint in not doing so. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=24.72s)]
*  It is the responsibility of the international community to come in before Hezbollah has [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=28.28s)]
*  to take its defense into its own hands, and maybe the situation will get out of hand at [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=33.88s)]
*  that time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  The Israelis have said that this offensive is to separate Hezbollah's support for Hamas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Iran has influence with Hamas as well. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=49.56s)]
*  Are you trying to get Hamas to agree to a ceasefire? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=51.34s)]
*  Well, I think Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  It's been Netanyahu and the Israeli government who have refused all along, even refused the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=57.56s)]
*  calls by the United States to engage in a ceasefire. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  Who has been vetoing resolutions in the Security Council calling for a ceasefire? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  Has it been the supporters of Hamas or the United States supporting Israel? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=70.08s)]
*  So even the claim that somebody needs to push Hamas to accept a ceasefire is ridiculous [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=74.72s)]
*  because everybody knows that Netanyahu depends on this war in order to continue to survive. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=83.08s)]
*  And Israel has conducted this war with the hope, with the illusion of winning this war, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=91.08s)]
*  which is impossible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=97.64s)]
*  On October 7th last year, Hamas created atrocities by invading Israel proper and killing civilians. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  I remember after the 2006 Hezbollah-Israel war, Hassan Nasrallah said that if he knew [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=109.04s)]
*  the result of what would have happened after he essentially took actions that created that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=117.28s)]
*  war, he never would have done it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=123.12s)]
*  I mean, Lebanon was devastated. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=124.68s)]
*  It was terrible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  Do you think that was... do you support what Hamas did against civilians in Israel, against [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=129.52s)]
*  children, women? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=134.6s)]
*  Nobody supports actions against civilians and Hamas certainly has been on the record [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=136.4s)]
*  saying that it does not support such actions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=141.0s)]
*  The history did not start on October 7th. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=146.56s)]
*  Israeli atrocities in Gaza, basically putting a huge number of people in the most populated [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=149.84s)]
*  the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  In an open prison for so long, depriving them of access to anything, basically, to basic [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  necessities has been an ongoing process. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Occupation of Palestine has been going on for 70 years. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  A system of apartheid in Palestine has been going on for many decades. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=176.6s)]
*  So history did not start on October 7th. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=183.16s)]
*  It's not for us to decide whether the price that Palestinians are paying was worth the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=185.68s)]
*  fight. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=191.32s)]
*  It's for the Palestinians to decide. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=192.32s)]
*  If you look at the polls in Palestine, Hamas' popularity has increased rather than decreased. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=193.88s)]
*  It's going down a bit and we're hearing a lot of people in Gaza who are really fed up [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  and who blame them too for bringing this terror on their heads, this hell. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  You see, there is a variety of opinion everywhere, but the polls indicate that the general popularity [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=208.56s)]
*  both in the West Bank and in Gaza has increased. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=215.4s)]
*  So these are the realities on the ground. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=218.84s)]
*  The Palestinians have to decide whether it was worth it or not, but it is for the international [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=221.12s)]
*  community to end this vicious circle, which will never have a victor. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  Israel will never be able to win this war, period. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=235.12s)]
*  And Netanyahu has to recognize this and understand this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0J8_Tp3aHQ&t=239.48000000000002s)]
