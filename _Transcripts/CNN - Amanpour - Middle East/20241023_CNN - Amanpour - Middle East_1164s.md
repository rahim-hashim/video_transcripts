*  for talking with us. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=47.8s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=49.04s)]
*  It's not easy to talk about, but [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=50.34s)]
*  October 7th was a shock. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=51.8s)]
*  I think to everybody, if I could [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=55.440000000000005s)]
*  just ask you to take me back to a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=59.18000000000001s)]
*  year ago, what were the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=61.84s)]
*  conversations within the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=63.24s)]
*  magazine about where the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=65.08s)]
*  magazine should stand, like how [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=66.84s)]
*  you should deal with these [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=70.28s)]
*  events? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=71.28s)]
*  I mean, first of all, I'll just [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=72.04s)]
*  say that, like, October 7th was a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=73.28s)]
*  lot of things and very, very [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=75.58000000000001s)]
*  difficult, but I can't say for [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=77.04s)]
*  sure that it was a shock. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=78.48s)]
*  Because we were watching events [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=80.04s)]
*  very, very closely, their warning [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=82.44s)]
*  signs were flashing that we were [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=84.08s)]
*  ripe for an attack like this, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=85.78s)]
*  that support for armed [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=88.38s)]
*  resistance within Palestinian [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=90.22s)]
*  communities was rising because of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=92.62s)]
*  the complete collapse of any [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  diplomatic solution and the way [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  that the Abraham Accords in [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=99.12s)]
*  particular signaled to the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=100.28s)]
*  Palestinians that there was no [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=102.28s)]
*  chance of them gaining their [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=104.18s)]
*  freedom. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=106.72s)]
*  And so, in fact, we were talking [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=108.78s)]
*  about exactly this within Jewish [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=111.42s)]
*  currents because we were [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=113.88s)]
*  listening to the Palestinian [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=115.02s)]
*  commentators and analysts that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=117.61999999999999s)]
*  were speaking to us. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  We knew that this was coming. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  So hold on a second. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=123.92s)]
*  You're not saying that this is [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  with the benefit of hindsight. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=126.38s)]
*  What you're telling me is those [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=127.88s)]
*  were active conversations then [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=129.78s)]
*  before October 7th happened. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=132.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=133.62s)]
*  I mean, I think anybody who's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=134.28s)]
*  been watching the situation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=135.72s)]
*  carefully can see that there was [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  going to be an increase or [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=139.48s)]
*  explosion of violence. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=141.88s)]
*  I don't think anybody expected [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=143.08s)]
*  it to. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=145.28s)]
*  I don't think anybody expected [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=146.68s)]
*  the Israeli defenses to crumble [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=148.22s)]
*  quite as much as they did. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=150.08s)]
*  And that was really a surprise. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  And of course, you know, the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=153.48000000000002s)]
*  horror of the attacks is a shock [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=155.38000000000002s)]
*  to the system no matter what. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=157.18s)]
*  But but in terms of the the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  existence of an attack like [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=162.58s)]
*  this, we in fact were reading [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=164.02s)]
*  texts together that would try to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=166.02s)]
*  help us prepare for such a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=167.68s)]
*  situation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  And we knew also that there was [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=169.52s)]
*  really no way for us to prepare, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=171.88s)]
*  that it was going to shatter our [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=173.38s)]
*  communities and that it was going [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=174.78s)]
*  to shatter our organizing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=176.72s)]
*  communities, that that many [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=177.92s)]
*  people in the Jewish communities [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  that we you know, that read [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=181.42s)]
*  Jewish currents were going to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=183.14s)]
*  have a slightly different [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=184.42s)]
*  emotional response to this event [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=185.88s)]
*  or profoundly different than [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=187.88s)]
*  than many of our Palestinian [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=189.34s)]
*  partners or readers. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=191.78s)]
*  And we struggled with this. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  You're you're a magazine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=197.54s)]
*  You're going to publish. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  You have thoughts. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=200.12s)]
*  What were some of the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=200.94s)]
*  conversations about what you [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=201.84s)]
*  should say? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=203.3s)]
*  It took us about five days to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=204.14s)]
*  publish, and that was intentional [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=205.8s)]
*  because I felt like we really [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  needed to slow down and not just [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=208.94s)]
*  be reactive, but really think [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=210.7s)]
*  about what our responsibility was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=212.04s)]
*  in this moment and how we were [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=213.9s)]
*  going to respond. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=215.0s)]
*  The first thing that we did was we [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=217.44s)]
*  collected questions from our [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=218.88s)]
*  readership about what they felt [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=220.14s)]
*  confused about. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  And we tried to systematically [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=223.5s)]
*  answer those questions. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=225.88s)]
*  But then there was also sort of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=227.14s)]
*  more emotional work. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=228.48s)]
*  How do I talk to my family? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=229.84s)]
*  You know, how do I recommit to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=232.6s)]
*  Palestinian liberation in this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=236.04s)]
*  moment, even if I know someone [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  who was killed in in the October [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  7 attacks? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  You know, parsing Zionism, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=243.34s)]
*  non-Zionism and anti-Zionism, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=246.18s)]
*  dealing with people's rifts [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=248.24s)]
*  within their own families, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  severe, severe rifts that may [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=251.18s)]
*  never be repaired. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=252.8s)]
*  We started we had a number of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=255.08s)]
*  in-person gatherings. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=257.94s)]
*  The question of grief was really [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=259.64s)]
*  a hot button issue, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=261.4s)]
*  particularly because many [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=263.3s)]
*  Jewish people were feeling [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=266.84s)]
*  grief, especially because there [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=268.2s)]
*  are real connections, familial [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  and otherwise, between American [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=271.84s)]
*  Jews and Jews living in Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=273.68s)]
*  And but but we didn't want that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=278.09999999999997s)]
*  grief to be weaponized on behalf [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=280.64s)]
*  of a militant response from the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=282.8s)]
*  Israeli government. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=284.7s)]
*  We really leaned into reporting [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=285.64s)]
*  because we really felt like [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=287.4s)]
*  there was a lot of information [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=288.44s)]
*  that needed to get out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=289.78s)]
*  We did a number of dispatches [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=291.1s)]
*  from the West Bank and Gaza, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=292.58s)]
*  what people were actually [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=294.14s)]
*  experiencing, but also alongside [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=295.44s)]
*  their political aspirations [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=297.54s)]
*  in the moment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=299.34s)]
*  We did reporting on hostage [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=300.94s)]
*  families because in the United [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=303.5s)]
*  States, there's a sense that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=304.88s)]
*  bringing home the hostages [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=307.48s)]
*  means more military action, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=308.8s)]
*  when, of course, in Israel, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=311.1s)]
*  the hostage families have been [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=312.8s)]
*  very, very clear that what they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=313.98s)]
*  want is a deal and exchange [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=315.2s)]
*  of prisoners and hostages [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=318.04s)]
*  on the Palestinian side. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  So we tried to really root [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=322.24s)]
*  in the questions that we were [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=325.0s)]
*  asking ourselves and the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=326.20000000000005s)]
*  misconceptions that were [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=327.24s)]
*  circulating in the narrative. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=328.54s)]
*  I have to assume and I think [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  it is a fact that contributors [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=333.8s)]
*  to Jewish currents have been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=336.88s)]
*  affected directly. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  I think one of your contributors [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=339.6s)]
*  has a family member held hostage. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=341.64000000000004s)]
*  And I think one of our [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=344.24s)]
*  contributors has had people killed. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=345.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, you also have contributors, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=347.6s)]
*  I believe, who've lost family [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=349.0s)]
*  members in Gaza. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=350.14000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it would be hard not to, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=350.86s)]
*  right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=352.04s)]
*  Not only that, I mean, look, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=352.44s)]
*  we've published dispatches from [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=353.8s)]
*  people in Gaza only for them to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=356.24s)]
*  be killed the next week. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, the carnage is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=360.3s)]
*  unimaginable. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=364.0s)]
*  What do you think is your job [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=365.36s)]
*  right now? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  Because as I read it, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=367.70000000000005s)]
*  it seems like what you're trying [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=370.74s)]
*  to do is hold space for a lot of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=372.16s)]
*  thoughts that a lot of people [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=374.6s)]
*  don't want to hold together. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=375.7s)]
*  But the grief, the intense grief [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=377.86s)]
*  of watching this massacre on [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=381.26s)]
*  October 7th take place in real [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=384.14s)]
*  time, and we were meant to see [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=385.8s)]
*  it in real time. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the perpetrators filmed [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=388.5s)]
*  it, they live streamed it, they [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=391.06s)]
*  wanted us to see it, okay? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=392.7s)]
*  And then the carnage in Gaza, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=394.94s)]
*  some of us as news organizations [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  still have people there who are [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=400.0s)]
*  still reporting. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=401.96s)]
*  We are seeing that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=402.9s)]
*  And then a world that's [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=404.1s)]
*  increasingly critical of Israel, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  but also rising incidents of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=408.1s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=410.94s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=412.36s)]
*  I think that, well, first of all, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=413.86s)]
*  let me just say that 30% of the [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=416.20000000000005s)]
*  Jewish community generally holds [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=418.36s)]
*  views that are consistent with [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=421.74s)]
*  non or anti-Zionism, and that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=423.0s)]
*  number rises to 40% under 44, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=425.14000000000004s)]
*  under the age of 44. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=428.8s)]
*  So our job in some way is to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=430.86s)]
*  hold this 40% of a younger [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=434.06s)]
*  generation, 30% of the community [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=437.36s)]
*  overall, to allow them a way to [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=439.72s)]
*  be Jewish and claim their [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=446.2s)]
*  Jewishness in the context of, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=448.32s)]
*  or in the framework of justice [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=450.72s)]
*  and liberation for Palestinians, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=452.6s)]
*  and also to fight for that from [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=455.26s)]
*  their particular positionality, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=458.62s)]
*  particularly as their [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=461.5s)]
*  positionality is being [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=462.6s)]
*  weaponized through accusations [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=463.8s)]
*  of anti-Semitism. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=465.86s)]
*  We know that anti-Semitism [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=466.90000000000003s)]
*  rises as, like, it directly [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=469.14000000000004s)]
*  correlates to the number of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=473.24s)]
*  Palestinians that the Israeli [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=474.6s)]
*  government kills. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=476.34000000000003s)]
*  Brown University just put out a [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  study that says that the death [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=480.36s)]
*  toll in Gaza may actually be [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=482.16s)]
*  closer to 100,000, if not more. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=484.34000000000003s)]
*  And so, yeah, like, I think when [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=486.70000000000005s)]
*  you have an Israeli government [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=488.3s)]
*  that is claiming to speak for [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=489.6s)]
*  Jews across the world, there is [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=491.86s)]
*  going to be rising anti-Semitism. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=493.22s)]
*  At the same time, the conflation [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=495.26s)]
*  of anti-Zionism and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=497.56s)]
*  anti-Semitism is muddying the [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=498.6s)]
*  water such that it becomes very, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=500.22s)]
*  very difficult to actually [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=501.8s)]
*  address that anti-Semitism in a [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  way that has real credibility [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  and that addresses the real [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=507.96000000000004s)]
*  pieces of it. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=511.82s)]
*  So can you talk about that for [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=513.0s)]
*  a minute? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=514.32s)]
*  When you say Zionism, what do [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=514.96s)]
*  you mean? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=516.5s)]
*  And when you say anti-Zionism, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=517.0600000000001s)]
*  what do you mean? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=518.96s)]
*  Because as you've just alluded [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=519.82s)]
*  to, there are people who argue [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=520.92s)]
*  that anti-Zionism is [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=524.16s)]
*  anti-Semitism, and there are [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=525.9599999999999s)]
*  other people who argue that [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=527.88s)]
*  closely related to that, that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=529.88s)]
*  anti-Zionism is a proxy for [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=531.5799999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitism. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=533.5799999999999s)]
*  So it doesn't matter if they're [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=534.36s)]
*  different because they're [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=535.2199999999999s)]
*  experienced in the real world the [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=536.5799999999999s)]
*  same way. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=537.88s)]
*  Zionism is an ideology that was [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=538.52s)]
*  founded in the late 19th century [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=540.36s)]
*  by Theodore Herzl. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=542.52s)]
*  We know this. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=543.4599999999999s)]
*  Judaism is a religion and culture [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=544.26s)]
*  of thousands of years. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=546.0799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, Zionism was never [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=547.88s)]
*  hegemonic within Jewish [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=550.32s)]
*  communities and became hegemonic [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=551.7800000000001s)]
*  over the 20th century. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=553.72s)]
*  But there was a Judaism before [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=554.96s)]
*  Zionism, and there will be one [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=557.62s)]
*  after on some levels. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=559.12s)]
*  So just as we would criticize [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=560.32s)]
*  any other state, and particularly [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=563.12s)]
*  a state that meets the legal [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=564.82s)]
*  definition of apartheid, as many [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=565.96s)]
*  human rights organizations have [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=568.48s)]
*  asserted, meaning that there are [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=570.62s)]
*  different, there's a different [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=572.72s)]
*  set of laws and a different [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=574.12s)]
*  experience of people of one [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=577.0200000000001s)]
*  group and people of another, we [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=579.32s)]
*  can criticize that state. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=581.88s)]
*  Now, there are ways that people [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=583.98s)]
*  have parsed this saying, you [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=586.08s)]
*  know, we think it's OK to [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=588.72s)]
*  criticize Israel, but there are [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=589.72s)]
*  various ways that criticizing [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=591.96s)]
*  Israel crosses into anti-Semitism. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=593.4200000000001s)]
*  That's, you know, true. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=596.32s)]
*  There is anti-Semitism in our [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=597.88s)]
*  movements, just as there is [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=600.5200000000001s)]
*  sexism and racism and homophobia [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=601.72s)]
*  and ableism. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=604.48s)]
*  And we have to work to root those [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=605.2600000000001s)]
*  out. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=606.58s)]
*  But that's part of the culture. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=606.9200000000001s)]
*  That's not part of our movements [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=608.28s)]
*  and that's not inherent in [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=609.68s)]
*  anti-Zionism. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=611.3199999999999s)]
*  What is anti-Zionism to you? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=612.3399999999999s)]
*  I was raised Zionist in a Zionist [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=614.04s)]
*  community and a Zionist home. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=617.9399999999999s)]
*  For me, what that what that meant [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=620.38s)]
*  was hazy. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=622.88s)]
*  It just meant that I belonged to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=623.9399999999999s)]
*  this community on some level. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=625.78s)]
*  I didn't really know. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=627.48s)]
*  And so when I started to do [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=628.4399999999999s)]
*  activist work for for Palestine, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=631.02s)]
*  I actually didn't call myself [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=634.4399999999999s)]
*  an anti-Zionist. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=636.9399999999999s)]
*  I didn't even think about Zionism [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=637.98s)]
*  because I didn't I barely knew [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=639.64s)]
*  what it was. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=640.74s)]
*  And I think that that's fairly [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=641.28s)]
*  common within the Jewish [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=642.34s)]
*  community. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=643.62s)]
*  It's a marker of belonging [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=644.12s)]
*  without a very firm definition. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=645.64s)]
*  And essentially what anti-Zionism [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=648.04s)]
*  means for me now is twofold. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=649.64s)]
*  One, it means that I recognize [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=651.22s)]
*  what Palestinians have [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=653.4200000000001s)]
*  experienced as Zionism, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=654.54s)]
*  as the primary way of understanding [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=656.48s)]
*  what Zionism means, because it has [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=658.78s)]
*  meant a different set of. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=660.78s)]
*  Different standards on equality, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=665.46s)]
*  the not having freedom of movement, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=668.6600000000001s)]
*  being tried in different courts [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=671.86s)]
*  according to different laws, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=673.38s)]
*  not having the right to vote [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=674.88s)]
*  for the government [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=676.0200000000001s)]
*  that controls their lives. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=676.6800000000001s)]
*  All of these. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=678.22s)]
*  Factors are what Zionism [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  means for for Palestinians, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=682.62s)]
*  it means in many cases being killed [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=684.6600000000001s)]
*  or massacred at will, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=687.88s)]
*  and certainly what we're seeing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=689.8800000000001s)]
*  in Gaza is that it has meant [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=691.58s)]
*  essentially ethnic cleansing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=693.16s)]
*  and mass murder. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=694.6s)]
*  And and so I see that. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=696.3199999999999s)]
*  And I also I have a diasporic [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=698.26s)]
*  interpretation of Judaism, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=700.8s)]
*  which which many ultra orthodox [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=703.36s)]
*  people across the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=705.36s)]
*  across the world share. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=707.3199999999999s)]
*  But also, I think many [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=710.4599999999999s)]
*  cultural Jews share [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=712.4s)]
*  that that there is something about [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=715.66s)]
*  being Jewish for me [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=718.26s)]
*  that is about [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=719.36s)]
*  understanding the stranger [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  in a certain sense [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=721.92s)]
*  and that that nationalism [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=723.88s)]
*  and particularly [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=726.4599999999999s)]
*  ethno-nationalism [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=727.2199999999999s)]
*  conflicts with that vision for me. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=728.38s)]
*  There's a well-known [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=730.38s)]
*  African-American writer. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=731.78s)]
*  I spoke to him on this program [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=732.7199999999999s)]
*  named Ta-Nehisi Coates, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=734.18s)]
*  who's written this book, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=735.2199999999999s)]
*  you know, the message [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  where he talks about [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=736.9799999999999s)]
*  a lot of these things. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=738.16s)]
*  And people basically called him [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=740.02s)]
*  a terrorist for saying these things [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  or saying he's [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=742.68s)]
*  he sympathizes with terrorists. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  When you say these things, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=744.8199999999999s)]
*  do people call you a terrorist? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=746.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=748.12s)]
*  We also get called [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=748.78s)]
*  kapos, like meaning the Jews [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=750.7399999999999s)]
*  who were, you know, put in [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=752.4399999999999s)]
*  by the put in charge [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=755.2399999999999s)]
*  in concentration camps [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=756.38s)]
*  by the Nazis of other Jews [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  and who oversaw their killing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=759.38s)]
*  in many cases. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=761.4799999999999s)]
*  I mean, we get called very, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=763.2199999999999s)]
*  very nasty things [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=764.42s)]
*  within the Jewish community [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=765.38s)]
*  and without [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=766.42s)]
*  help hating you on Jews, ex-Jews, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=767.5799999999999s)]
*  all as the Jews. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=770.78s)]
*  The list goes on. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=772.52s)]
*  And what is maddening about it [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=774.52s)]
*  is that what we're really trying to say [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=777.92s)]
*  at its very basic level [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=779.78s)]
*  is that Palestinians [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=781.48s)]
*  deserve basic human rights [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=782.38s)]
*  and equality and dignity [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=783.98s)]
*  and reparations for [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=785.64s)]
*  the plunder of their homes [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=788.18s)]
*  and and the right to return [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=789.92s)]
*  to those homes [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=791.98s)]
*  under international law. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=792.8199999999999s)]
*  These are international laws, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=795.64s)]
*  first of all, that were created [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=796.88s)]
*  after the Holocaust [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=798.98s)]
*  to stop something like it [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=799.92s)]
*  from happening again. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=801.18s)]
*  And precisely because [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=802.5799999999999s)]
*  there's a conception of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=804.9399999999999s)]
*  Israel is kind of like [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=807.74s)]
*  the inheritors of [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=808.98s)]
*  the Holocaust and Holocaust trauma. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=811.4200000000001s)]
*  It's very, very hard [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=813.48s)]
*  to break through that [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=814.62s)]
*  and just allow people [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=816.52s)]
*  to see the basics [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=818.28s)]
*  of what is actually happening. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=819.54s)]
*  It must be particularly [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=821.98s)]
*  galling to you [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=824.44s)]
*  and to others with whom you work, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=825.58s)]
*  because as I understand it, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=826.94s)]
*  your father's family [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=828.08s)]
*  were survivors of the Holocaust. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=829.02s)]
*  Your mother's family [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=832.12s)]
*  were Arab Jews from Haifa [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=833.04s)]
*  and what was formerly [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=834.78s)]
*  formerly known as Palestine. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=836.28s)]
*  And I'm just thinking that [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=837.82s)]
*  to come from a heritage [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=840.62s)]
*  of survival and then to be called [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=842.2800000000001s)]
*  some of these names must be. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=845.1800000000001s)]
*  It's enormously painful. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=847.08s)]
*  I mean, my my dad's parents [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=848.48s)]
*  are survivors, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=850.72s)]
*  were survivors from Salonica [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=851.4200000000001s)]
*  of Auschwitz. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=853.0600000000001s)]
*  But frankly, it's really [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=853.86s)]
*  not about me. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=855.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, we're doing this work [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=856.9200000000001s)]
*  because of the images [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=859.5600000000001s)]
*  that we are seeing right now, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=861.62s)]
*  just specifically coming out of Gaza, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=864.0200000000001s)]
*  people being burned alive, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=865.82s)]
*  people being carried, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=867.46s)]
*  their remains being carried [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=868.52s)]
*  in plastic bags. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we have to respond to this [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=871.1s)]
*  not just as Jews, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=873.72s)]
*  but as Americans, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=874.76s)]
*  as as global citizens. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=875.8000000000001s)]
*  A world that allows this to go on [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=879.6600000000001s)]
*  is the same world that allowed [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  these things to happen in, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=883.5s)]
*  you know, in the 1940s [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=885.96s)]
*  allowed my grandparents, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=887.3000000000001s)]
*  you know, to be in [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=890.1s)]
*  concentration camps. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=893.46s)]
*  And I I understand now [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=895.06s)]
*  in a visceral way [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=897.8599999999999s)]
*  how that was allowed to happen. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=898.8599999999999s)]
*  How do you answer the question [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=900.8199999999999s)]
*  of those who argue that [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=903.1199999999999s)]
*  that if [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=905.4s)]
*  if Israel were to become a [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=908.16s)]
*  multi-ethnic, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=910.9s)]
*  multiracial democracy [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=912.6199999999999s)]
*  as the United States strives to be, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=916.6199999999999s)]
*  that sort of the tables [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=918.76s)]
*  would turn again [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=919.8s)]
*  and that Jewish people [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=921.26s)]
*  would be subsumed in this, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=922.1199999999999s)]
*  particularly given that that that land [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=924.12s)]
*  is surrounded in the Middle East [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=926.32s)]
*  by people who do not share [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=927.42s)]
*  this the same religion [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=928.82s)]
*  and who have been hostile [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=929.96s)]
*  to Israel for generations. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=932.88s)]
*  How do you how do you answer that? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=934.62s)]
*  I would basically ask [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=935.96s)]
*  whether Israelis are safe right now. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=937.22s)]
*  You know, there has been [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=941.12s)]
*  there have been attacks [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=943.38s)]
*  almost every day [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=944.48s)]
*  or not every day, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=946.02s)]
*  but there was one attack, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=946.88s)]
*  I think, on the highway [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=947.92s)]
*  that killed a number of people. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=949.02s)]
*  There were some attacks at a bus stop. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=951.12s)]
*  We saw an enormous number of people [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=953.56s)]
*  killed on October 7th. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=956.6199999999999s)]
*  That's you know, is that safety? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=962.56s)]
*  And the Arab states [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=965.9599999999999s)]
*  directly around [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=969.26s)]
*  Israel have basically said [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=971.8199999999999s)]
*  that they would accept 67 borders. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=973.16s)]
*  Even Hamas has said that. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=975.3599999999999s)]
*  And actually, what you have [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=978.06s)]
*  is an Israeli government [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=980.02s)]
*  that has been saying, no, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=981.1199999999999s)]
*  we want all of it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=982.32s)]
*  There's no there's no two states. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=984.1600000000001s)]
*  There's no negotiation. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  And we are going to slug [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=989.98s)]
*  this out with force. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=991.7600000000001s)]
*  I think that if you saw a shift towards [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=993.2600000000001s)]
*  Palestinian equality and freedom, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=997.38s)]
*  Jews would be safer. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1000.4200000000001s)]
*  To the question, though, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1001.88s)]
*  this is the question [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1002.82s)]
*  that constantly comes up is, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1003.62s)]
*  do you question Israel's right to exist? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1004.72s)]
*  How do you how do you answer that question? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1007.2800000000001s)]
*  That's a difficult question, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1011.0400000000001s)]
*  because I do not question [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1012.2800000000001s)]
*  the right for Jews to live in safety [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1014.14s)]
*  where they live, anywhere that they live. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1016.0400000000001s)]
*  But the right to an ethno state [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1018.7800000000001s)]
*  or state that privileges [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  the rights of one group of people [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1024.48s)]
*  over another group of people, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1026.64s)]
*  I don't believe that that [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1028.44s)]
*  that you can countenance that [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1032.02s)]
*  the question of rights [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1034.28s)]
*  who exist has become one of those questions [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1035.24s)]
*  that obscures rather than illuminates [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1037.52s)]
*  what's actually happening. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1040.02s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1041.62s)]
*  is that you have 15 million people [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1042.82s)]
*  living between the river and the sea. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1044.58s)]
*  Half are Jews, half are Palestinians. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1046.3799999999999s)]
*  And in order to create a demographic [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1048.68s)]
*  majority for a Jewish state, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1051.18s)]
*  you will need to do one of two things. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1053.36s)]
*  Ethnic cleansing and mass murder. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1055.02s)]
*  Many, many human rights experts [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1056.82s)]
*  and experts in international law [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1058.48s)]
*  are calling a genocide. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1060.32s)]
*  So I. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1061.86s)]
*  Is is that what we mean [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1065.12s)]
*  by the right to a state? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1067.56s)]
*  Do you feel? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1070.92s)]
*  It's well, I'll ask it this way. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1074.02s)]
*  Is there anything giving you hope in this moment? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1075.72s)]
*  This is a very dark moment. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1084.02s)]
*  I don't know what to say. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1085.46s)]
*  This is like a dark night of the soul. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1087.52s)]
*  I think that [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1092.26s)]
*  the only thing giving me hope [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1094.52s)]
*  is that it's so dark [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1096.06s)]
*  that maybe it's the dark before the dawn, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1097.96s)]
*  that maybe, you know, people [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1102.3s)]
*  will be able to see what is happening [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  and build something new on top of, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1108.52s)]
*  you know, the ashes of the old [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1111.0s)]
*  out of the ashes of the old. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1112.76s)]
*  You know, maybe this is the kind of old world [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1114.7s)]
*  struggling to die in the new one, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1117.4s)]
*  struggling to be born. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  But that does mean that now is the time of monsters [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1122.7s)]
*  that they say as they say. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1125.1000000000001s)]
*  And I do think that [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JaM_OP2ebc&t=1127.1s)]
