Video Description: Israeli military action continues to devastate the civilian population in Gaza. A three-day siege of Al-Shifa Hospital is in progress despite the fact that thousands are sheltering there. The IDF, claiming the site is being used by senior Hamas terrorists, says it has killed 90 of them. The bombardment is pushing Gaza towards a devastating humanitarian crisis: A U.N.-backed organization reports that more than a million people -- half the population of Gaza -- are on the brink of catastrophic hunger. David Miliband is President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee. He is a former British Foreign Secretary and is himself a child of Holocaust refugees.

# "A Failure of Humanity:" IRC's David Miliband on Impending Famine in Gaza | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE)
*  A U.N.-backed organization reports that half of Gaza, which is more than a million people, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=0.0s)]
*  are on the brink of catastrophic hunger. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=5.36s)]
*  The British Foreign Secretary David Cameron says the status quo is unsustainable. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=8.0s)]
*  And earlier this week, the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan had even harsher words. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=12.84s)]
*  Instead of pause to reevaluate where things stand in the campaign and what adjustments [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=17.92s)]
*  are needed to achieve long-term success, instead of a focus on stabilizing the areas of Gaza [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=23.04s)]
*  that Israel has cleared so that Hamas does not regenerate and retake territory that Israel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=28.8s)]
*  has already cleared, the Israeli government is now talking about launching a major military [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=34.52s)]
*  operation in Ra'a. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  More than a million people have taken refuge in Ra'a. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=40.78s)]
*  They went from Gaza City to Khan Yunis and then to Ra'a. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=44.38s)]
*  They have nowhere else to go. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Gaza's other major cities have largely been destroyed. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=50.36s)]
*  And Israel has not presented us or the world with a plan for how or where they would safely [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=53.46s)]
*  move those civilians, let alone feed and house them and ensure access to basic things [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=58.6s)]
*  like sanitation. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=63.64s)]
*  So the clear frustration of the Biden administration and the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=65.56s)]
*  scheduled to talk behind closed doors with Republicans in Congress. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=70.26s)]
*  Now the International Rescue Committee calls the imminent famine in Gaza, quote, a profound [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=75.64s)]
*  failure of humanity and entirely preventable. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=80.54s)]
*  David Miliband is president and CEO of the IRC. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  He's a former British Foreign Secretary and he himself is a child of Holocaust refugees. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=87.48s)]
*  David Miliband, welcome back to our program. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=93.08s)]
*  Thank you, Christian. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  So the WHO, you all, everybody is really trying to sound the alarm of what is we can see by [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  the pictures, this impending famine. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=103.58000000000001s)]
*  Who do you blame for this? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=106.68s)]
*  Well first of all, let's just be absolutely clear that the threat of imminent famine described [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=108.56s)]
*  by the United Nations is not someone, an official in New York writing a press release. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=113.76s)]
*  The International Phase Classification System is a detailed, technocratic, quite small-see [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=118.0s)]
*  conservative look at the facts on the ground. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=123.64s)]
*  They describe, as Secretary Blinken said, a million people at level five, that is famine [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  level. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=132.84s)]
*  The rest of the population, level four is considered an emergency, level three a crisis. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=133.84s)]
*  So 2.2 million people don't know where their next meal is coming from and the million who [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=139.68s)]
*  are at risk of famine, imminent risk of famine, in level five represent the fastest degradation, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=145.62s)]
*  the fastest acceleration of a hunger crisis that's ever been seen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=153.36s)]
*  Now how do you explain that to get you to your question? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=158.24s)]
*  This is about very straightforward decisions that are being made on the ground about the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=160.94s)]
*  number of crossing points, about the number of trucks that are allowed to go through crossing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=167.04s)]
*  points, about what aid, above all food aid, is allowed to go on the trucks that go across [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=171.72s)]
*  the crossing points, about the transit of trucks once they are inside Gaza, because [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=176.68s)]
*  you'll know a World Food Program convoy was turned back in the middle of the night inside [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  Gaza last week. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=187.16s)]
*  So you've got a series of impediments, blockages, restrictions being put in place on lorries [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  carrying the most basic humanitarian aid and it's not getting through to the people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=194.54s)]
*  who need it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=199.78s)]
*  That's why you're ending up in the situation where what are frankly fourth and fifth best [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=200.84s)]
*  alternatives, dropping aid from the sky, building a pier that's going to be online in another [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=205.66s)]
*  six weeks, that won't help the people at imminent risk of famine now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=210.66s)]
*  What they need is different decisions about crossing points, about truck numbers, about [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=215.64s)]
*  what goes in the trucks. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=220.18s)]
*  So those decisions are in the hands of the Israeli government and the IDF. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=221.46s)]
*  The UN says it has enough food sitting in those trucks that you're talking about to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=225.06s)]
*  feed the two million people plus inside Gaza. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  What possible reason could a democracy at war have for denying the basic elements of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=234.06s)]
*  survival? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=242.10000000000002s)]
*  Well no good reason has been given. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  There's one part of the argument which I think is important to get clear, which is that some [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=244.38s)]
*  of the trucks are being turned back because of allegations that some of the items on a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=248.32s)]
*  truck might be quote unquote dual use. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=253.4s)]
*  In other words they might have civilian use as well as military use. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  Let's be clear what kind of items we're talking about. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=259.8s)]
*  A pair of scissors for use in a health centre. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=262.48s)]
*  My own organisation has doctors, orthopedic surgeons working in one of the hospitals, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=266.64s)]
*  not the Al-Shifa hospital, another hospital in Gaza, but they lack the most basic, the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=271.2s)]
*  saline drips, the saline at all, the most basic implements with which to do their work. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  And when a pair of scissors gets found on a truck the whole truck gets turned back. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  So we're talking about a really serious set of very localised decisions but also bigger [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=289.48s)]
*  decisions about the number of crossing points and how they're used. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=295.62s)]
*  I want to place just so that our viewers and you also really hear from at least one person [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  there of the desperate hunger that they face. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=305.35999999999996s)]
*  What has this child done to suffer from hunger? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=311.28s)]
*  I cannot find him milk for five shekels or a packet of milk from the agency. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=313.76s)]
*  There the normal milk is for 150. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=319.44s)]
*  There is no work, there is no food, no drinks. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=322.11999999999995s)]
*  We are eating plants. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=325.2s)]
*  We started eating pigeon food, donkey food. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=326.64s)]
*  We are like the animals. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  I saw you shaking your head. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=332.0s)]
*  I mean this reference to them eating animal food is shocking still every time we hear it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=333.24s)]
*  Yeah and remember the International Phase Classification Report that came out the day [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=339.24s)]
*  before yesterday, 25 children have died of starvation already. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=344.92s)]
*  This is not about rhetoric, this is not actually about politics, this is about human survival [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  and that's why it's a failure of humanity. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyeKfjt7oJE&t=356.64s)]
