# Israel Faces "Excruciating Dilemmas" in Fighting Hamas, Says Amb. Dennis Ross | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o)

*  The Oslo Accords raised hopes for peace in the Middle East, but war sadly is once again [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=6.48s)]
*  ripping the region apart. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=11.16s)]

*  unfulfilled, and what must be done to reimagine a better future for the region. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=22.0s)]
*  Thanks, Biana. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=28.16s)]
*  Ambassador Dennis Ross, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=29.5s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=32.26s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=33.26s)]
*  Especially at this very difficult moment. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=35.34s)]
*  Thank you for sharing these insights with us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=39.1s)]
*  I wanted to start by saying that you've devoted your career to shaping U.S. involvement in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=41.94s)]
*  the Middle East peace process. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  You served under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=49.1s)]
*  Obama. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=54.1s)]
*  And I hope the question isn't too banal, but I just wanted to ask what your sort of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=55.7s)]
*  first reaction was to the events of last week. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=60.660000000000004s)]
*  Sure, H.W. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=65.02s)]
*  I've worked on this issue for so long. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=66.5s)]
*  I've seen terrible things before. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=69.26s)]
*  I was very close to the sites of suicide bombings. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=71.7s)]
*  I've seen everything, and I've seen nothing like this. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=75.86s)]
*  This was just a deliberate decision to kill as many people as you could, to draw no distinction [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=81.22s)]
*  in terms of age, to take grandmothers back to Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=90.78s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=97.46s)]
*  The area next to Gaza is made up of communities, some of which are people by those Israelis [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=98.46s)]
*  who are very much on the right side of the political spectrum, and some of the people [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=107.02s)]
*  it seems are very much on the left side of the political spectrum. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=111.7s)]
*  These are people who actually deeply believe in making peace with the Palestinians, even [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=116.06s)]
*  being prepared to make real concessions to the Palestinians. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=121.5s)]
*  Hamas came in there. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=124.74s)]
*  They drew no distinction. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=125.94s)]
*  If you were pro-peace, they killed you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=126.94s)]
*  If you were against peace, they killed you. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=128.26s)]
*  They asked no questions. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=130.18s)]
*  They just wanted to kill Israelis. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=131.26s)]
*  And I have to say, bluntly speaking, I think they just wanted to kill Jews. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=132.46s)]
*  So one of the reasons we called you is that you are one of the key negotiators of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=136.94s)]
*  1993 Oslo Accords. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=140.34s)]
*  And I just wanted to ask, for people who don't remember, perhaps who are too young to remember, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=142.9s)]
*  if you could just remind us of what was so significant about that agreement. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=147.26s)]
*  I'm glad you asked that, because this has always been an existential conflict. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=152.22s)]
*  What I mean by that is you have two national movements, two national identities, and they're [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=157.58s)]
*  competing for the same space. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=162.38s)]
*  The significance of Oslo was that after an era of mutual rejection and mutual denial, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=164.66s)]
*  you had the PLO, the National Liberation Movement of the Palestinian People, as they defined [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=171.62s)]
*  themselves, and you had the Israelis. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=177.26s)]
*  Zionism is the National Liberation Movement of the Jewish People. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=180.82s)]
*  You had the Israelis and the Palestinians after an era of mutual denial, crossing that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  psychological threshold and recognizing each other. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=190.22s)]
*  It meant they were taking an existential conflict and turning it into a political one. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=194.06s)]
*  Existential conflicts you can't resolve. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=199.46s)]
*  Religious conflicts you can't resolve. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=201.74s)]
*  National conflicts you can resolve. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=204.3s)]
*  Political conflicts you can resolve. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=206.1s)]
*  And so the hope of Oslo was that you were transforming a conflict that could never be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=208.02s)]
*  resolved into one that now was one we could solve. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=213.58s)]
*  And of course, part of the reason this is important is that I'm not sure people remember [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=218.02s)]
*  that, as you just said, this is both national movements, two different national movements [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  with a claim on the same land, recognizing each other's existence and then committing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=226.57999999999998s)]
*  to a political process to sort it out. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  So Hamas, you know, they've never accepted the existence of the state of Israel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=232.26s)]
*  Do you have thoughts about why that is? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=239.78s)]
*  They have an ideology. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  They viewâ€”Hamas is literally, it's an acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  Their ideology is that all of Palestine was part of an Islamic trust. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  And as part of an Islamic trust, not one inch could be surrendered. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=255.06s)]
*  And that is an ideology, a credo, that they have lived with. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=259.46s)]
*  People tend to forget every time we were making progress in the 1990s, every time we were [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=263.82s)]
*  making progress, we would get suicide bombings from Hamas. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  When I hear people say today, well, Hamas wouldn't have done this if there was a peace [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=275.42s)]
*  process. On the contrary, when there was, they were the ones who did everything they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=278.78s)]
*  could literally to kill it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=282.94s)]
*  And even now, clearly, one of the motivations was the prospect that Saudi Arabia, the king [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=285.53999999999996s)]
*  is the custodian of the two holy mosques, most important Sunni Arab leader, most important [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=292.38s)]
*  Sunni Muslim leader in the world was prepared, it appeared, was in the process of being [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=297.97999999999996s)]
*  prepared to make peace with the nation state of the Jewish people. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=303.9s)]
*  So you would be removing or at least diminishing the religious element of this conflict. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=308.14s)]
*  And for Hamas, that was a fundamental threat. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=314.42s)]
*  OK, so let's wheel around to the other reason we called you, is that you had just published [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=317.78000000000003s)]
*  a new essay in Foreign Affairs. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=322.26s)]
*  I would say I think it's a fairly tough minded statement for someone like yourself, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=323.74s)]
*  especially for someone like yourself, who's been so invested and involved in the peace [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=329.1s)]
*  process. And in this, you say the only way to achieve a lasting peace, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=332.66s)]
*  where Israelis and Palestinians is a complete dismantling of Hamas. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=337.86s)]
*  You say decapitating Hamas is leadership, destroying its military infrastructure, killing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  a large number of its fighters and even occupying Gaza again are very real objectives. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=347.1s)]
*  Why are you so convinced of that at this point? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, there I was sort of laying out what were Israeli objectives now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  I wasn't saying this is exactly what I think the objective would be. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=360.34000000000003s)]
*  This is where Israel is coming from, because their paradigm of, in a sense, living and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=364.26s)]
*  coexisting with Hamas since 2009, they came to realize that was not a manageable cost. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=369.34s)]
*  Now, having said that, the essence of what I was saying is that it is clear that Hamas [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  cannot continue to be a threat towards Israel, number one is also clear there is no [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=382.65999999999997s)]
*  possibility of creating reconstruction in Gaza so long as Hamas is in a position where, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=388.09999999999997s)]
*  at a time of its choosing, it can blow everything up again. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=393.38s)]
*  So I do take the view that Hamas has completely delegitimized itself by what it has done. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=396.29999999999995s)]
*  It is not a partner in any way, shape or form. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=402.21999999999997s)]
*  And I do think there has to be an outcome. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=405.29999999999995s)]
*  I would like to see this kind of formula that I was saying, I like to see demilitarization [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=407.78s)]
*  of Gaza in return for massive reconstruction of Gaza. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=412.34s)]
*  And I don't see Hamas being in a position where it will ever go along with anything [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=415.94s)]
*  like that. So I think at a minimum, Hamas has to be put in a position where its [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=420.78s)]
*  fundamental power has been dramatically eroded. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=426.46s)]
*  The idea that you can eradicate something like Hamas is something I think is beyond [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=431.34s)]
*  anybody's capability, but you could dramatically weaken it to the point that it doesn't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=434.73999999999995s)]
*  have the kind of capability to disrupt everything else. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=438.94s)]
*  And I think at a minimum, that has to be the outcome. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=441.29999999999995s)]
*  And so this is a situation where the cost to Israel and the cost to the people of Gaza [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  is going to be very high. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=450.5s)]
*  You said that, you know, Hamas is completely delegitimized. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=452.3s)]
*  We have no way of knowing how much legitimacy Hamas actually has among the people of Gaza [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=454.86s)]
*  because they haven't had elections in 16 years. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=460.74s)]
*  We also know that the population in Gaza is very young. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=463.18s)]
*  I mean, the average Gazan is like 18 years old, 50 percent of the population of children. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=466.18s)]
*  They have no voice in this. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=470.14s)]
*  And we also know that Hamas has a history of, I don't know how else to put this, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=472.14s)]
*  embedding itself in the civilian population. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=475.9s)]
*  Right. I mean, that would be accurate to say. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=479.14000000000004s)]
*  So given that, how how could this be accomplished without a massive loss of life among [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=481.66s)]
*  people who are perhaps fair to say themselves hostages in this land? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=488.18s)]
*  Look, you are so right. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=493.70000000000005s)]
*  I and I won't surprise you. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=495.90000000000003s)]
*  I have friends in Gaza right now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=499.1s)]
*  I have spoken to some of them in the last couple of days. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=501.26000000000005s)]
*  My heart is literally breaking over what I see happening. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=505.42s)]
*  And and yet I also know they're being held hostage by Hamas. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=509.74s)]
*  You know, one of the persons I was able to speak to was describing how, you know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=514.86s)]
*  she's already lost members of her family. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=520.02s)]
*  She said, we're the ones who are vulnerable. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=521.9s)]
*  Yes, the Israelis have have basically directed us to seven areas in Gaza. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=523.4200000000001s)]
*  But I have 90 year old parents who are not movable. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=529.14s)]
*  You know, we're exposed. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=532.22s)]
*  All the Hamas leaders are deep underground. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=534.0600000000001s)]
*  So look, this is a terrible dire situation. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=536.82s)]
*  And yet we face the reality where whatever we say, the Israelis are no longer going to [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=541.4200000000001s)]
*  live with this threat. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=548.58s)]
*  And this is left to right completely. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=550.82s)]
*  It's a complete consensus. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=553.5s)]
*  So, you know, this is a this is a terrible reality. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=555.58s)]
*  But in a sense, Israel is now facing its ISIS. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=558.62s)]
*  When we fought ISIS, when when, you know, in Mosul and in Raqqa, you know, there are a [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=561.9s)]
*  lot of innocent people who were killed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=568.3s)]
*  You're dealing with a threat that actually wants to invite the killing of innocence. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=570.34s)]
*  And it forces you into these terrible, excruciating dilemmas where if you don't take [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  these steps, you have to continue to live with this group, which will continue to carry [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=585.38s)]
*  out outrages. And at some point, you have to try to find a way to deal with it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=589.58s)]
*  What I was the thrust of what I was laying out in terms of the objectives, I said the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=594.4200000000001s)]
*  international community should emphasize the unconditional release of all the hostages [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=598.74s)]
*  and it should emphasize the demilitarization and offer reconstruction. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=603.94s)]
*  I mean, I'm hoping that under some circumstances, you might be able to bring this to an end [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=609.14s)]
*  so that the supreme price that we could be seeing paid, in fact, doesn't materialize. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=615.34s)]
*  You are quite right. Look, the price Palestinians will pay is terrible. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=622.0600000000001s)]
*  The price the IDF will pay is also awful. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=626.38s)]
*  So it is a you know, it's an awful situation. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=630.62s)]
*  But we also know who's responsible for it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=634.26s)]
*  Hamas is responsible for it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=636.58s)]
*  Well, but do you are you convinced that the world will see it that way? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=638.1s)]
*  I mean, the fact is that there are a lot of people around the world who look at this, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=641.58s)]
*  look at the you could just see the destruction kind of whole neighborhoods wiped out. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=648.1800000000001s)]
*  And you talked about the safe quarters that the Israelis are directing people to. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=653.94s)]
*  But a lot of them saying, how can I how can I get there? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=658.0200000000001s)]
*  How does Israel maintain its moral authority and continue to use this level of overwhelming force? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=660.5s)]
*  I think it's hard. Look, it's I said they're excruciating the lemon. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=667.4200000000001s)]
*  But I think here are the things I would like to see happen. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=671.14s)]
*  I would like to see the Israelis emphasize that again, that there are these safe areas there. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=674.14s)]
*  And I'd like to see the Israelis facilitate humanitarian assistance going into those areas. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=680.54s)]
*  I want Israel to be able to put itself in a position where it says we are fighting Hamas. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=686.74s)]
*  We are not punishing Palestinians. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=691.46s)]
*  I think this is the way they have to present it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=693.78s)]
*  It's the way I think that we should be talking about it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=695.9s)]
*  We have to frame this issue for what it is. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=698.62s)]
*  You have to take on this group that has visibly unspeakable atrocities on the one hand, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=702.26s)]
*  and will continue to do it if given an opportunity. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=709.98s)]
*  And on the other hand, you also have to try to do this in a way that tries to do as much as you can [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=712.94s)]
*  to safeguard the lives of Palestinians who aren't responsible for what Hamas does. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=720.4200000000001s)]
*  Do you think that the Israeli government is actually making that, or the Israeli leadership is actually [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=726.74s)]
*  making that distinction at the moment? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=732.34s)]
*  I think that they're in a situation where it's really hard to make these kinds of distinctions, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=734.9s)]
*  but I think there is some effort being made. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=739.5s)]
*  And I think the more we talk about it, there'll probably be some greater effort. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=741.5s)]
*  Ultimately, it is in Israel's interest to show fighting Hamas is one thing, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=745.38s)]
*  dealing with the Palestinians as a people is something very different. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=750.02s)]
*  And what about the Biden administration? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=752.86s)]
*  Do you think that the Biden administration is doing enough to convey the message that you have just delivered? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=754.9s)]
*  Well, I think that the president, when he spelled everything out, he said, he said, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=763.82s)]
*  do it within the confines of international law. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=768.3s)]
*  Now, it is true that international humanitarian law, as it relates to the use of force, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=771.3s)]
*  force that is designed to achieve a very clear military objective, will in the end, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=777.34s)]
*  unfortunately, also end up producing what will be civilian casualties, because that's the nature of war. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=783.62s)]
*  But I think the administration is trying to strike the balance, and it's a hard balance to strike. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=792.3s)]
*  Anyone who thinks there's a simple answer here is ignoring it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=797.86s)]
*  For those who say Israel has to stop, well, then you're just guaranteeing we're going to see more of what Hamas does. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=801.3s)]
*  Hamas deliberately targets civilians. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=807.26s)]
*  The Israelis don't deliberately target civilians. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=810.1800000000001s)]
*  There's an important distinction here. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=812.94s)]
*  We need to have an outcome where Hamas's ability to do that basically doesn't exist any longer. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=814.98s)]
*  So let's wheel it around and say, for the sake of discussion, that [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=820.82s)]
*  through whatever means that fighting is contained, that Hamas is dismantled even at a grievous cost. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=827.86s)]
*  And I realize that, you know, we're using this very antiseptic language, but, you know, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=836.82s)]
*  I am mindful, as I hope, as I see that you are, that you tell me you are, that for every person that we're sort of talking about here, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=839.9399999999999s)]
*  there is a mother who's seen their child lying dead. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=846.6999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? There is some innocent person who had no opportunity to intervene in this who will pay a very dear price. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=849.4599999999999s)]
*  OK, so let's establish that we know this. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=856.54s)]
*  But let's just say, for the sake of our conversation, that Hamas is dismantled. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=859.38s)]
*  What happens? What should happen after that? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=864.3s)]
*  Like, how does the region go forward after that? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=866.98s)]
*  I think one of the things I wrote in that piece was we need to be thinking about the day after right now. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=871.5400000000001s)]
*  We can't wait until the day after to be thinking about it. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=876.9000000000001s)]
*  There needs to be an alternative administration in Gaza, maybe under some kind of international trusteeship. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=879.98s)]
*  There needs to be a plan for reconstruction as part of that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=887.94s)]
*  There need to be elections held six to nine months later. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=891.1400000000001s)]
*  There needs to be, in other words, it needs to be a strategic plan for what is going to happen in Gaza afterwards. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=895.18s)]
*  And that plan needs to ensure it can't be rearmed. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=901.06s)]
*  But it also needs to create kind of the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for Gaza. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=904.86s)]
*  One of the good things about Gaza from that standpoint is it is small. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=909.18s)]
*  We're talking about an area that is not much bigger than the greater New York area. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=914.54s)]
*  So the potential and you're going to have so much destruction there that rebuilding the infrastructure and in a sense, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=920.6999999999999s)]
*  almost starting from a low end, you can make a big difference pretty quickly and give Palestinians there a chance to breathe. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=929.6999999999999s)]
*  So that would be one thing. The second thing is I don't write off the possibility that we will still see maybe several months down the road, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=937.9s)]
*  a Saudi-Israeli breakthrough, in which case part of that will also involve what is done for Palestinians in the West Bank as well. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=947.1800000000001s)]
*  Not only in terms of changing how they live, but also tangible steps that would would ensure that two states remains an option for the future. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=956.5400000000001s)]
*  Then you can change the trajectory. Then you can move in a way that becomes dramatically more hopeful. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=966.22s)]
*  What we can't do is become so lost in what's happening right now that we lose sight of anything that might happen over time. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=973.54s)]
*  And look, I completely you use the word grievous and there's a poverty of language to capture what it means to see these losses. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=983.26s)]
*  I mean, that's what makes it so hurtful, because these are not just numbers. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=993.1s)]
*  These are all individual human beings with families. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=997.3s)]
*  Do you think there is the political will in the United States to support to show leadership even in the kind of project that you've spoken of? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1001.06s)]
*  Well, I hope so. Look, obviously, we have our own political realities here. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1012.18s)]
*  I do think that President Biden would want to would want to come out of this with a potential to change the realities in the Middle East. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1018.9s)]
*  We've got a reminder that every time we think we can ignore the Middle East, it reimposes itself on us. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1028.14s)]
*  And to think that the Middle East is disconnected from a larger global competition, competition, we're constantly reminded that it is not. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1034.5800000000002s)]
*  So you have an area that for another 30 years, fossil fuels will still be important. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1042.8200000000002s)]
*  You still have to manage a transition away from fossil fuels. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1048.74s)]
*  The Middle East will be important from that standpoint. It's important from a strategic, geographic standpoint. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1051.8600000000001s)]
*  It's important from a standpoint that it generates these ideologies that are a threat to everyone. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1057.1s)]
*  So the more you you remove yourself from the Middle East, the more you end up being sucked back in. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1062.3799999999999s)]
*  But only under worse circumstances. Nothing would be worse than to have this event and then to do nothing in the aftermath of it. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1067.74s)]
*  Ambassador Dennis Ross, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1075.7s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNwj_IGk87o&t=1078.78s)]
