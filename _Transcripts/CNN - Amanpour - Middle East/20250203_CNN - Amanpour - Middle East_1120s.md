# What It Means to Be Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [February 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU)
*  Well, now, as we've been discussing, there's much uncertainty about the second phase of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=0.0s)]
*  the ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=3.6s)]
*  After nearly 16 months of war, the humanitarian situation there remains dire. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=5.2s)]
*  Author and journalist Peter Beinart believes equality between Israelis and Palestinians [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  is the only way to secure peace and safety for good. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=14.34s)]
*  It's something he addresses in his new book, Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=18.12s)]
*  and he joins Michelle Martin to discuss. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=23.52s)]
*  Thanks, Bianna. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for talking with us once again. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=28.319999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  You open your latest book with what you call a letter to a former friend. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  It's heartbreaking. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=38.72s)]
*  But will you just tell us about this letter? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=39.72s)]
*  And why is this a former friend? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=44.32s)]
*  So this, my public views of opposition to the war in Gaza and opposition to the idea [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=47.12s)]
*  of a state that gives Jews rights that Palestinians don't have is a very, very unpopular view [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=54.44s)]
*  in certain elements of the American Jewish community. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=60.68s)]
*  And many of the places, institutions in which I spend my life because I'm an observant Jew, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=63.0s)]
*  and so Jewish institutions are structure of my life. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  And in those institutions, there are many people who I care about a great deal, who [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=72.32s)]
*  feel very betrayed by my views, especially because they're expressed so publicly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=75.88s)]
*  And people said many times, you know, Peter, I feel like you are putting my family at risk. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=80.92s)]
*  And so I wanted to write this book for those people to try to explain why I see things [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=86.08s)]
*  so differently, why I feel like our organized community has gone so profoundly wrong, and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=92.56s)]
*  why that I believe that what we're doing and what we're supporting in Israel's treatment [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=98.04s)]
*  of Palestinians and Israel's destruction of Gaza is not just a violation of our best ethical [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=101.92s)]
*  and religious traditions, but ultimately endangers us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=107.84s)]
*  This latest book is titled Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=111.36s)]
*  It's not being Jewish after October 7th. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  It's not being Jewish after 1947. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  Why after the destruction of Gaza? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=123.84s)]
*  Why is that the beginning point? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Because I think that the Jewish community feels and wrestles with the horror of October [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=130.0s)]
*  7th. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=135.36s)]
*  That's for all of us omnipresent and doodling for myself, one of the most traumatic days [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=136.68s)]
*  of my life. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  I know people are already wrestling with the horror of that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  But what led me to write this book was seeing so many good and decent people that I know [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=145.0s)]
*  who day after day after day somehow seem to be able to block out the screens of what was [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  happening in Gaza. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=155.96s)]
*  Like I was looking at my computer screen every day and also hearing from people who have [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=157.44000000000003s)]
*  And every day I was thinking, I can't believe that this is happening. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=161.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=165.84s)]
*  Most of the buildings are being destroyed. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=166.84s)]
*  Most of the schools, most of the hospitals, most of the agriculture, the number of children [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=168.32s)]
*  who have been killed just dwarfs what we've seen in Ukraine or almost any conflict of [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=172.72s)]
*  the 21st century. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=178.08s)]
*  More child amputees than any other place in modern history. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=179.08s)]
*  And I look at my community that I love and I see that people are justifying this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=182.48s)]
*  Maybe they're saying it's unfortunate, but they're also saying it's necessary. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=186.88s)]
*  To me, that reflects an unwillingness to truly face what is being done in our name as Jews. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=191.24s)]
*  How did this understanding start for you? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=199.32s)]
*  Because you have a reputation as a person who has long been concerned about Israel's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=202.12s)]
*  role in the world, the way it manages its governance of its territories, and the story [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=210.12s)]
*  it tells the world about itself. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  I was raised in a family where Israel was very, very important, you know, as a sense [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=220.12s)]
*  of security, that there was a state for Jews after the Holocaust. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=224.28s)]
*  My father, my grandfather, I remember how much they loved to be in Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=228.88000000000002s)]
*  When I started going to Israel as a kid, I also loved being there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=232.72000000000003s)]
*  You know, when you're used to being this really small minority and then you grow into, go [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=235.44s)]
*  to like a Jewish civilization where everything you see reflects your identity and your culture. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=239.08s)]
*  It's a very powerful experience. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=243.72000000000003s)]
*  But I had no experience with what all this meant for Palestinians. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=246.16000000000003s)]
*  That was completely off of my radar screen. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=249.24s)]
*  It wasn't until my 30s. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=251.12s)]
*  I'm embarrassed to say so late in my life that I first went to spend time with Palestinians [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=252.52s)]
*  in the West Bank to see what Israel meant for them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=257.24s)]
*  And on the first day, I thought, oh my goodness, I'm going to have to rethink some things that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=260.0s)]
*  I had no idea what it really meant for people to live under the control of a state where [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=265.32s)]
*  they had no rights, where they couldn't become citizens, where they couldn't vote, where [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=270.2s)]
*  they lived under military law, where they needed military permission to travel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=274.08s)]
*  And it was that experience with Palestinians that made me rethink what it means to me to [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=278.48s)]
*  try to live ethically as a Jew. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you remember what it is that you saw literally on those first days that awakened this, I [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=286.8s)]
*  don't know any other way to call it, but a moral crisis in you? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=293.32000000000005s)]
*  I remember talking to a woman, I write about it in the book, and she had two daughters [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=296.68s)]
*  and then they had a son. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=301.0s)]
*  And then when she had her daughters heard that she had a son, the daughter started crying [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=302.84000000000003s)]
*  hysterically because in their village, the boys would throw stones at Israeli soldiers [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=306.4s)]
*  and the Israeli army would then go in in the middle of the night and pull boys out of their [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=312.96s)]
*  homes. They didn't necessarily knew who threw the stones, but they knew that probably that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=317.08s)]
*  boy could inform on the other boys, even if it wasn't him. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=320.12s)]
*  And then it would hold them in, you know, because they live under military law, you can [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=323.23999999999995s)]
*  be held under indefinite detention without family, without a lawyer, often, often physically [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=326.84s)]
*  harmed for days. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=331.52s)]
*  And I saw that fear and it made me realize, what does it mean to live under the control [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=333.36s)]
*  of a state that has life and death power over you, but is not accountable to you at all? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=337.44s)]
*  You can't vote. You don't live under the same law as your Jewish neighbors. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=342.32s)]
*  It's a terrifying experience to be powerless vis a vis a state that has control over you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  And I had never really internalized that. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=352.0s)]
*  I'd never imagined been able to imagine myself in that place. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=354.36s)]
*  Yeah, interestingly, you you're actually from South Africa. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=358.36s)]
*  Your family is from South Africa. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=361.24s)]
*  And I just wonder how, you know, yes, what role that that played in your understanding [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=363.08s)]
*  of these things. What happened is after I started to learn from Palestinians and read [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=369.28s)]
*  Palestinian writing and get an understanding of what Israel had meant meant for [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=374.11999999999995s)]
*  Palestinians, I started to hear echoes of what I heard white South Africans say during [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=379.32s)]
*  apartheid, because white South Africans almost universally were convinced that if black [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=383.67999999999995s)]
*  people got the right to vote, that their lives would be in grave danger. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=388.4s)]
*  It was considered just obvious that basically apartheid was what kept white people safe [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=392.32s)]
*  because, you know, Nelson Mandela did not believe in nonviolence. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=397.36s)]
*  The African National Congress used armed resistance. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=400.52s)]
*  They were called a terrorist organization by the United States government. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=403.0s)]
*  They were being funded by the Soviet Union. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=405.92s)]
*  It looked terrifying to white people. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=408.04s)]
*  And so I kept thinking, why were all of those white South Africans, including people in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=410.15999999999997s)]
*  my own family, why were they wrong? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  Why actually were white people not slaughtered? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=415.92s)]
*  Why did the ANC's military wing disband after the end of apartheid? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  And the reason I think is that it wasn't necessary anymore, because when people have [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=423.56s)]
*  the right to vote, when they can when they can get the government to listen to them [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=427.40000000000003s)]
*  without having to take up arms, most people are much, much happier doing that than having [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=431.76s)]
*  to put their lives at risk, which is why when you give people equality under the law, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=437.40000000000003s)]
*  things become safer. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=441.48s)]
*  And so that began to transform the way I heard these debates in the Jewish community, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=443.0s)]
*  where people always say, unless we have a state in which we have legal superiority, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=448.04s)]
*  we can't be safe. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=452.8s)]
*  Really, this book is is directed toward Jewish people, really. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  I mean, and so I want to start. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  I want to talk about what you call the story that Jewish people tell themselves about [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  being history's permanent virtuous victims. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=470.92s)]
*  I mean, I think that oftentimes because of our extremely traumatic history, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=472.36s)]
*  there is a tendency in Jewish discourse to imagine that the only role that we play vis [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=478.16s)]
*  a vis other people in the world is as the role in the role of victims. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  So after October 7, the horror of October 7, people immediately started calling it a [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=488.48s)]
*  pogrom, which was essentially referring to it as a kind of continuation of the assault [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=494.48s)]
*  on Jews in the Russian Empire in the early 20th century, as if the Palestinians are the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=499.24s)]
*  reincarnation of these anti-Semites from Europe a century ago, or indeed even the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=504.4s)]
*  reincarnation of the of the Nazis. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  Right. But the conditions in Israel, Palestine are completely different. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=511.96s)]
*  You can't understand the violence against Jews in Europe without understanding that [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  Jews were legally inferior in Israel. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=520.9599999999999s)]
*  Palestine, it's Palestinians who are legally inferior. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=524.3199999999999s)]
*  Jews have legal supremacy over Palestinians. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=527.64s)]
*  And so if you want to understand this terrible act of violence by Hamas, you have to be [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=530.76s)]
*  willing to face the fact that Palestinians live without basic rights. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=535.64s)]
*  And if you ignore that fact, you're basically just suggesting that Palestinians are the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=539.36s)]
*  reincarnation of the Jew haters of old. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=543.92s)]
*  They are not people in it themselves that you need to actually try to understand. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=547.52s)]
*  And you also say that, well, let's just talk about something that is actually a very it's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=552.72s)]
*  a very delicate thing to speak about in any circumstance. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=557.28s)]
*  But many people do compare the atrocities of a Hamas attack on October 7th to the events [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=560.5600000000001s)]
*  of the Holocaust. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=565.76s)]
*  And people, you know, talking about the Holocaust is always sort of very fraught, you know, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=567.52s)]
*  no matter where you are. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=572.36s)]
*  But you argue that this isn't quite the right analogy to invoke. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=574.36s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=579.6s)]
*  Again, because you can't understand the Holocaust without understanding the fact that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=581.16s)]
*  Jews were Europe's other, the subordinated class for centuries. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=585.2s)]
*  October 7th is much more in my mind like an inhumane, brutal attack by people who are [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=590.5200000000001s)]
*  oppressed. Right. And there are this happens tragically throughout history. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=597.8000000000001s)]
*  Think about America in the 19th century, when Native Americans had been forced off their [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=602.08s)]
*  land, crowded into smaller and smaller reservations. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=606.9200000000001s)]
*  When they had the opportunity to fight back, oftentimes they didn't distinguish between [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=610.5600000000001s)]
*  civilians and and combatants. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=614.84s)]
*  They killed men, women and children in horrifying ways, just like Hamas did in horrifying [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=616.88s)]
*  ways. Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=622.48s)]
*  This doesn't get discussed enough in the American media. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=625.4s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza are not from Gaza. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=628.12s)]
*  They are the descendants of refugees that were forced out of what's now Israel. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=630.32s)]
*  Many of them can see from Gaza their lands in which they live. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=633.88s)]
*  Now they live in a place that's called an open air prison by human rights watch. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  My friend, Mohammed Shahada, told me that everyone he knew growing up in Gaza had [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=642.24s)]
*  contemplated suicide. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=646.36s)]
*  There was because there was no hope for them to have a decent life in those. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=647.96s)]
*  If you want to make sure that we never have October 7th again, God forbid, you have to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=653.88s)]
*  deal with those and that underlying oppression, because when you inflict violence on [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=658.32s)]
*  people, the structural violence that Israel has inflicted on Palestinians in Gaza and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=663.76s)]
*  beyond, you ultimately make everybody less safe. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=667.92s)]
*  Peter, one of the points that you make in your book is that criticizing the way Israel [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=670.88s)]
*  conducts itself on the world stage and the way Israel conducts itself within Gaza and [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=675.32s)]
*  the West Bank is not the same as being anti-Semitic. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=678.88s)]
*  OK, but you but you can acknowledge, can you not, that Hamas and Hezbollah are that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=682.84s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist groups have been or are. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=691.1600000000001s)]
*  Anti-Semitic and want to kill Jews. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=697.2s)]
*  So how should we think about that? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=700.2s)]
*  The way I think about it is that when people are denied their rights, they resist that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=701.84s)]
*  oppression and they do so in a range of ways, some of which are ethical and humane, some [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=707.5200000000001s)]
*  of which are unethical and inhumane, some of which sometimes they do so in a spirit of [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=711.96s)]
*  equality and the recognition of the humanity of all people. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=717.0s)]
*  And sometimes they do so in a kind of in the case of Hezbollah and Hamas in an Islamist [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=720.76s)]
*  ideology, which is itself supremacist because it believes that there should be an Islamic [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=725.56s)]
*  state in which Muslims have rights that are superior to Christians and Jews. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  And so it seems to me the right way to respond to this is if you want to weaken Hamas, if [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  you want to defeat Hamas and Hezbollah, you have to support Palestinians who are who are [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=739.4s)]
*  fighting for their freedom in ways that are ethical, in ways that are consistent with [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=744.3599999999999s)]
*  international law, in ways that don't target Israeli civilians. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=748.28s)]
*  And when I look at what Israel and America have done, look at how they respond when [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=751.96s)]
*  Palestinians appeal nonviolently, when they try to go to the UN or to international courts [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  or when they call for boycotts or divestment and sanctions in the spirit of the anti-apartheid [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=761.0s)]
*  movement or when they do nonviolent marches like the Great March of Return or even when [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=765.0s)]
*  they collaborate with Israel in order to convince Israel that they can be trusted by [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=769.56s)]
*  working cooperatively with the Israeli military as the Palestinian Authority does. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=774.2s)]
*  Israel defeats all of those efforts. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=778.4s)]
*  Palestinians have not gained anything from those ethical nonviolent struggles. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=781.2s)]
*  So if we are horrified by October 7th and we oppose the ideology from us and we don't [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=785.68s)]
*  want a single Israeli Jew to die, we are incumbent, it seems to me, on us to support [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=790.64s)]
*  ethical, humane, nonviolent Palestinian resistance to show Palestinians that there's [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=795.56s)]
*  a better way. And I fear that the United States government and Israel and the organized [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=799.96s)]
*  American Jewish community has done exactly the opposite. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=803.76s)]
*  Is it your view that more people share your view than are willing to express it publicly, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=806.72s)]
*  particularly in the wake of October 7th? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=814.12s)]
*  I remember I remember a conversation that I had with a young college student who is [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=816.0s)]
*  observant like yourself, deeply observant, and said that in the wake of October 7th, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=822.68s)]
*  she said to her parents, well, didn't didn't we want a place where we could be safe and [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=829.28s)]
*  free? Don't Palestinians want the same thing? [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=835.12s)]
*  They want a place where they can be safe and free. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=837.88s)]
*  And she told me that her parents said to her, now is not the time. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=840.44s)]
*  Polling shows actually that particularly among younger American Jews, there are [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=844.24s)]
*  remarkably high percentage of young American Jews say things like they think Israel is [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=848.32s)]
*  an apartheid state. And there was a fascinating poll done by a Canadian political [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=852.28s)]
*  scientist, Mira Sukharov, where she asked American Jews if they consider themselves, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=857.0s)]
*  would you consider yourself a Zionist if Zionism means that Israeli Jews have more [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=860.96s)]
*  rights than Palestinians? Most American Jews said no. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=865.08s)]
*  So there are undoubtedly a lot of very passionate supporters of the state of Israel [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=868.12s)]
*  and of what is and of this this war. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=873.2s)]
*  But there's also a climate of fear that exists in the American Jewish community. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=875.9200000000001s)]
*  Rabbis know that if you publicly criticize Israel too harshly, you very well lose your [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=879.6s)]
*  job. Or if you're a teacher at a Jewish school or a Jewish camp, people know this very [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=885.5600000000001s)]
*  well. And so oftentimes people suppress what they say. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=890.08s)]
*  Young American Jewish kids know this as well, that the consequences for them could be [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=894.9200000000001s)]
*  very severe. And so I think that there's much more division and much more diversity [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=898.88s)]
*  of opinion among American Jews than you might sometimes know, because sometimes people [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=904.84s)]
*  are afraid to express it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=909.32s)]
*  One of the things that we haven't talked about yet, though, I do want to talk about is [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=910.76s)]
*  this whole question of who is indigenous, like who are the indigenous people? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=914.92s)]
*  Right. Yes. And, you know, one of the arguments that's emerged is that it describes [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=920.56s)]
*  Israel as a settler colonial state. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=926.4s)]
*  It sort of suggests that these are people who came from someplace else and planted [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=928.3199999999999s)]
*  themselves on the indigenous people, displaced them, killed them, oppressed them, etc. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=932.8399999999999s)]
*  But then other people argue that Jews also have indigenous rights to this land. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  So how do you think about that? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=941.16s)]
*  I think both of these things can be true. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=943.16s)]
*  Nobody needs to tell me that Jews have a deep and profound ancient spiritual [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=945.12s)]
*  connection to this place. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=950.92s)]
*  When I woke up this morning, I prayed a liturgy which spoke about a desire to return [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=952.16s)]
*  to the land of Israel. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  It's very, very deep within our tradition. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=960.3199999999999s)]
*  But it's also the case that the Zionist movement was created in the late 19th and early [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=962.96s)]
*  20th century by Europeans who referred to themselves as colonists. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=967.36s)]
*  Theodore Herzl writes to Cecil Rhodes, the Archimperialist of Southern Africa, and [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=973.48s)]
*  says, we have a colonial project here. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=977.36s)]
*  It's just like yours. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=979.36s)]
*  Vladimir Japatinsky, the founder of revisionist Zionism, Netanyahu's own tradition. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=980.96s)]
*  Colonial was a positive term for them. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=985.24s)]
*  It meant bringing modernity to a backward part of the world. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=987.84s)]
*  And people say, wait a second, it can't be settler colonial if people have deep roots [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=990.7600000000001s)]
*  in that place. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=995.32s)]
*  Cornel West's answer to that is to cite Liberia, right? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=996.36s)]
*  The people who colonized Liberia were enslaved black Americans who had come from West [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=999.88s)]
*  Africa. They also had roots in that place. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1004.68s)]
*  But when they went back to create a state in Liberia, they oppressed the native [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1007.4399999999999s)]
*  populations there because they also had notions of them as of themselves as kind of [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1011.6s)]
*  coming from a superior society and wanting to rule. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1016.4s)]
*  So these two things can both be the case. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1019.4s)]
*  And as you said, Jews have the right to live equally and safely in Israel, Palestine. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1022.36s)]
*  I believe that very, very deeply. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1027.76s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you have the right to superiority over another people. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
*  What is your vision for this land? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1033.44s)]
*  Israel, Palestine is a binational society. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1035.72s)]
*  You have two nations, two groups that both see themselves as nations that both that [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1037.92s)]
*  speak a foreign language that would have to be represented in government. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1042.08s)]
*  So it would might be a binational democracy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1045.1200000000001s)]
*  But the principle that I believe is that wherever Jews and Palestinians live alongside [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1047.72s)]
*  one another, they should be they should live equally under the law. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1052.28s)]
*  And I my hope, I don't know if I'll ever see it, is that when we look at what happened [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1055.8s)]
*  in South Africa and we look at that South African legal team that went to the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1061.4s)]
*  International Court of Justice and there were white people and black people and Indian [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1065.4s)]
*  people and people of all different backgrounds and they were saying, look at us. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1069.52s)]
*  We overcame supremacy and we are now fighting to make to fight for that principle [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1074.6000000000001s)]
*  around the world of human equality. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1079.96s)]
*  That's my dream of what we could have among Palestinians and Israelis, a legal team of [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1082.1200000000001s)]
*  Palestinian and Israeli Jews saying we overcame of supremacy. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1087.32s)]
*  We live together in equality and are what we accomplish can be now an inspiration for [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1092.64s)]
*  the world. And I really believe the world needs that inspiration today. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1098.1200000000001s)]
*  Peter Barnard, thank you so much for talking with us. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1101.8400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPqykIXG-aU&t=1104.2s)]
