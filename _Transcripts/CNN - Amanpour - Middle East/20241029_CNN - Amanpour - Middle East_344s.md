Video Description: Some 100 people are reported dead in Gaza this morning after a strike on a multi-story building. Many of the dead are being buried in makeshift graves because official burial grounds are too dangerous to access. Tens of thousands are dead after more than a year of war, and although ceasefire talks are once again underway, a breakthrough looks unlikely. On Sunday, Egypt had reportedly proposed a two-day ceasefire, only for Prime Minister Netanyahu’s office to say it had received no proposals. Moreover, according to Israeli media, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has warned Netanyahu that the war is lacking in strategy and needs a reset. Amid all this, an unlikely pair, two former senior officials — Israeli and Palestinian — are proposing what they argue is a way out of war. Ehud Olmert was Israel's Prime Minister while Nasser Al-Kidwa was Foreign Minister for the Palestinian Authority. Together, they have formulated an outline for peace, and they join the program to discuss.

**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc)
*  Just give me, before we get to the nitty-gritty, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=0.0s)]
*  why have you decided this now? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=2.44s)]
*  This is the best possible time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Had everyone agreed, had there not been a war, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=8.0s)]
*  and we were living in a quiet atmosphere, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=11.64s)]
*  everyone would say, what a rush. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=15.72s)]
*  I mean, why do you hurry? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=17.84s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=19.36s)]
*  Now that there is war, there is pain, there is suffering. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=20.6s)]
*  People are killed, both sides, in a terrible way. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=24.6s)]
*  There must be something must be done in order to change it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  And someone must try and offer a beacon of light, of hope, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=31.84s)]
*  that can change the atmosphere. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=38.8s)]
*  And I'm so happy and I'm so proud [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=41.48s)]
*  that I have this partnership with Dr. El-Kidwa, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  that together, and we are relatively well-known, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=48.56s)]
*  at least in the region, that we can come together, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  speaking for Palestinians and for Israelis, and say, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=57.96s)]
*  hey, there is a way which must be pursued seriously. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=61.44s)]
*  And there is no alternative to it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=66.64s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=68.12s)]
*  So this all started October 7, at least the latest [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=68.84s)]
*  outlet and bloodletting with the Hamas invasion of Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=72.72s)]
*  1,200 people killed, hundreds held hostage, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  100 at least are still there, dead and alive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=79.88s)]
*  And for the Palestinians in Gaza, Dr. El-Kidwa, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=82.64s)]
*  43,000 dead, according to the health ministry there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=85.84s)]
*  What is your reason, beyond stopping the bloodshed, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=90.4s)]
*  what is your reason for a little bit of hope [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  and that brings you together with a former Israeli [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=98.08s)]
*  prime minister? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=100.12s)]
*  Well, it is a very painful situation. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=104.08000000000001s)]
*  There is no doubt about that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=105.72s)]
*  And yes, it is a very extraordinary situation, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=107.12s)]
*  not only because of our presence together here, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=111.28s)]
*  but because of the actual pain and agony felt [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=113.8s)]
*  on both sides in the region because of the war that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  is expanding now to Lebanon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=121.39999999999999s)]
*  And God knows what else after that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=123.28s)]
*  And it is precisely because the reason is that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  The reason is that pain and war and bloodshed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=129.48s)]
*  is not going to do a solution. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=133.24s)]
*  It will not lead us to a different situation. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=135.24s)]
*  Actually, it will take us to square one, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=137.84s)]
*  and it will be more and more of the same, more and more [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=140.28s)]
*  of destruction and bloodshed. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=143.52s)]
*  And that has to change. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  We need to change the course, and we [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  need to find the solution. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=149.0s)]
*  So I just want to talk about today's news, which [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=150.36s)]
*  we showed in the introduction, Prime Minister. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=152.52s)]
*  Another bombing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=155.96s)]
*  It seems to be that since Yahya Sinwa, the head of Hamas, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=157.28s)]
*  was eliminated, in the words of your government, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  about two weeks ago, I mean hundreds and hundreds more [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  people have been killed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=168.4s)]
*  There's a lack of aid going in. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=169.84s)]
*  When this peace proposal that you have, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=171.84s)]
*  does this war need to continue? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=176.56s)]
*  Do you not think it should end? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=178.08s)]
*  I think, I thought, eight months ago, not a week ago, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=180.76000000000002s)]
*  not two weeks ago, eight months ago, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=185.68s)]
*  I thought that it should have stopped. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=187.44s)]
*  We have reached a point where we achieved most of what [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=189.44s)]
*  we had to achieve, which is to destroy the military capacity [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=196.84s)]
*  Hamas is a terrorist, murderous organization. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=197.8s)]
*  There is no question about it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=200.4s)]
*  They did something absolutely terrible, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=201.84s)]
*  and it was an inevitable reaction [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=204.4s)]
*  that Israel had to make. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  But we achieved most of what we can achieve [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  in the military operation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=212.52s)]
*  We destroyed the Hamas. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=213.96s)]
*  We destroyed the tunnels. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=215.68s)]
*  Not 100% of them, but enough. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=217.12s)]
*  We destroyed their weapons, their rockets, their bunkers, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=220.0s)]
*  their command positions, everything. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=223.44s)]
*  Now what happens is that we lose Israeli soldiers. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=226.0s)]
*  We lose innocent Palestinians living in Gaza, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=229.84s)]
*  embedded with the Hamas. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=234.04s)]
*  And of course, it is a main reason [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=235.88s)]
*  for the growing number of innocent civilians being killed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  But we are not going to get back the hostages [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=243.84s)]
*  if we will not stop the war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=247.36s)]
*  And the time is to stop it today, right now, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=248.68s)]
*  and to make an agreement that will bring back the hostages. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=252.84s)]
*  There will be Palestinian prisoners released, no doubt. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=257.08000000000004s)]
*  And then we will have to pull out from Gaza altogether. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  And there will be a military force and an administration [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=265.12s)]
*  force, two different things. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=268.76000000000005s)]
*  They will take over Gaza, and they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=270.56s)]
*  will provide for the security that there will not [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=273.04s)]
*  be any further military terrorist attacks from Gaza [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=275.8s)]
*  to the state of Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=281.8s)]
*  And then the question remains, what [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=282.92s)]
*  are we going to do with 6 million Palestinians? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=287.48s)]
*  This is a question that we have to ask, not Dr. Al-Kidwah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=290.64000000000004s)]
*  He, sure, has this question from his side, but from our side. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=293.92s)]
*  What are we going to do with 6 million Palestinians? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=297.72s)]
*  We have to find a solution. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=300.36s)]
*  Now there is not any solution other than a two-state solution. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=302.76s)]
*  And that's what we, based on what [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=308.36s)]
*  I have proposed to Abu Mazen in 2008 when I was prime minister, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=310.92s)]
*  that's what we have to do now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  We have to try and bring it back to the center stage, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=316.76s)]
*  to the international discourse, to the ministries, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  prime ministers, governments everywhere, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  to bring it back and deal with it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-OQ_o4epGc&t=327.48s)]
