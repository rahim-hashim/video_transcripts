Video Description: Israel has confirmed the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the October 7th attacks, when its soldiers encountered and engaged three terrorists during a routine operation in Gaza. Only after the clash did they find a body resembling Sinwar's. Israel analyzed the corpse's DNA and found a match with the Hamas leader. Investigative journalist Ronen Bergman discusses the news and its significance for Israel and the Middle East.

# NYT Journalist Discusses the Killing of Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk)
*  Okay, so as we though have been told by the IDF the foreign minister that it is absolutely confirmed in the US has been told [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=0.0s)]
*  That it's been confirmed just for people who might not understand how Israel would know and check [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=7.34s)]
*  Obviously because Sin while was in Israel jails for about two decades, right? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  They would have his DNA his teeth pictures and x-rays and all the rest of it [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, they have all of these the dental record the fingerprints [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Which could be also examined back in Gaza. They don't need to fly the the body or the fingerprints over they have the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  online [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=36.72s)]
*  Database and the DNA all taken when from the time he was the prisoner. He was released the Shalit deal in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=38.04s)]
*  2011 so this could be easily matched and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=46.16s)]
*  And I want to ask you a question because people want to know who are the other two or one other body there [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Some Americans have said and others and I think even you know [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=56.84s)]
*  Katari anyway, people have been saying that if the successor is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=62.08s)]
*  Yahya sin was brother Muhammad then then quote unquote we're screwed because [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=67.04s)]
*  He apparently is no touchy feely kind of guy in terms of ceasefires [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=73.4s)]
*  It might even be worse and certainly hostage deals. What do you know about that? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=78.4s)]
*  So the the brother Muhammad Sinu is considered to be even more extreme [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=84.72s)]
*  Or rogue as much as someone can be more extreme or wrong that that [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=93.16s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=97.96s)]
*  He was not in the vicinity where [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=99.16s)]
*  The alleged he was you know, it was killed [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  He is believed to be somewhere else in southern Gaza [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=107.12s)]
*  And he it is assessed by Israeli intelligence that he will be the successor [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=110.72000000000001s)]
*  The late the sin or was holding two hands [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=116.92s)]
*  He was the leader of Hamas in Gaza, but also he replaced [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=120.72000000000001s)]
*  Ismail Hania as the political leader the head of the political Bureau of heart these two hands have given to Muhammad sin [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=124.72000000000001s)]
*  Or I think in the coming future. We should express expect a more hard line [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=132.0s)]
*  from Hamas [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=138.0s)]
*  From Hamas and not something that would get us anywhere close to a final ceasefire [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=139.56s)]
*  and exchange of hostages this is even before I speak about the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=146.36s)]
*  expected positions from [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister and we are going to hear from the Israeli Prime Minister [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=154.44s)]
*  But but but I want to ask you again because all Israeli families and friends of the hostages [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  That's their main demand to have their people back a Qatari [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=163.52s)]
*  The Qatari Prime Minister has told reporters in Brussels this week basically in the last three to four weeks [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=168.52s)]
*  There's been no conversation or engagement at all and we're just moving in the same circle with silence from all parties [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=174.44000000000003s)]
*  So Qatar who's been brokering and hosting a lot of these ceasefire talks [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=180.72000000000003s)]
*  What more can you tell us about what might happen if this is the case? Yeah, yes in work gone or not [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  So [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=193.32s)]
*  Maybe this will be the opening of yet another round of talks because everything is completely stuck [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=194.76s)]
*  Hamas has given its final answer on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=202.12s)]
*  July 3rd and then Benjamin Netanyahu Israeli Prime Minister what was called the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=205.68s)]
*  Clarification letter just loaded more obstacles and more new terms some of them already given up by Israel [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=210.88s)]
*  And then Hamas loaded new terms, so it's this is this this road [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=217.0s)]
*  This is this this road is [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=221.4s)]
*  nowhere to be solved maybe now with [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  the killing of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=228.32s)]
*  If you see no are there could be a new opening there are some ideas in the Israeli leadership to maybe offer a ceasefire in exchange [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=230.36s)]
*  For hostages, maybe some immunity if someone gives the hostage back. This is yet to be seen and decided [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=238.56s)]
*  But it's a it's a watershed moment [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=246.32s)]
*  A [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=249.24s)]
*  Yet to be seen what kind of direction Hamas will take one concern big concern of Israelis of [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=250.44000000000003s)]
*  Israeli officials is that now with no direct control of [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=258.08000000000004s)]
*  The late Iqyat sinwar, maybe the teams guarding the hostages [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=264.08000000000004s)]
*  Will have [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  Less commanded control system and will [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=272.92s)]
*  You know have their own opinion on how to continue not just them [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=277.2s)]
*  But also all Hamas forces this could lead to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  Defermentation of the organization which does not necessarily mean good news [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5FtxYVREuk&t=286.08s)]
