# From the Holocaust to Gaza: Dr. Gabor Maté on the Impact of Trauma | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk)
*  Well, for those Palestinians returning to their homes in northern Gaza and the families [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=0.0s)]
*  in Israel reuniting with their loved ones, conversation now begins to turn to rebuilding, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  processing, and yes, eventually healing. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=10.0s)]
*  It's something that our next guest has an intimate understanding of as a survivor of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=13.08s)]
*  the Holocaust. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=16.98s)]
*  Renowned physician, author, and self-help guru Dr. Gabor Matei join Michel Martin to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=18.2s)]
*  discuss his own experiences and how they've informed his perspective on trauma in Israel [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=23.04s)]
*  and the Palestinian territories. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  Thanks, Bianna. Dr. Gabor Matei, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=30.84s)]
*  Yes, sir, having me. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  You are renowned for your work as a physician, an author, a speaker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=35.68s)]
*  Many people know your work, especially your work about trauma and the way that trauma [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=42.16s)]
*  can have generational impacts. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  But for people who are not familiar with your work, would you mind describing how your [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=49.2s)]
*  family's experience with the Holocaust informs this work? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, I was born a Jewish infant two months before the Nazis occupied my home country, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=57.44s)]
*  Hungary. My grandparents died in Auschwitz when I was five months of age. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=62.08s)]
*  My mother and I came very close to being deported there ourselves. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  My father was away for the first year and a half of my life, even forced labor. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=71.12s)]
*  I was heavily impacted by the bombing of the war and, of course, by the terror inflicted [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=74.84s)]
*  on the Jewish people in my homeland. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  And that has had lifelong effects on my fundamental functioning, emotional functioning. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=82.72s)]
*  I feel about myself. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=89.08s)]
*  I've had to do a lot of healing to overcome many of the impacts of that trauma. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=90.6s)]
*  How did you come to know this about yourself? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  Because I think some people think that experiences that infants have, you know, you're [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  pre-verbal at that time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=105.2s)]
*  And so you wouldn't have the ability to sort of articulate those memories. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=107.16s)]
*  How did you come to know that those early experiences had such a deep impact on your [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=111.08s)]
*  life? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=116.12s)]
*  Well, I came to know, first of all, by having to deal with my own issues, with my [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=116.76s)]
*  difficulty paying attention, my ADHD tendencies, my depression, my self-dislike, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=120.16s)]
*  despite all the success that I had in the world. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=127.84s)]
*  And then, of course, as a physician and a researcher and the reader of the research, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=130.44s)]
*  I found out about how early experiences, pre-verbal experiences, even intrauterine [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=136.88s)]
*  experiences, shaped the human brain and the human personality. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=141.24s)]
*  And it was not difficult to draw the links between my early experiences and my later [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=145.24s)]
*  challenges, given what science has told us about the impact of early experiences. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=150.52s)]
*  And the more pre-verbal it is, the deeper it is, actually. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  One of the other things about your work that strikes us is that it's you describe the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=161.56s)]
*  impact of trauma on a cellular level, on an individual level, but you also describe it [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=166.4s)]
*  as having social impact, that there can be traumas that penetrate a society deeply. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=172.44s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons we called you, because we are in the throes of a moment [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=178.08s)]
*  of sort of profound international trauma. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=183.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=185.6s)]
*  Let's just start with what happened in Israel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=186.12s)]
*  We are more than a year past the Hamas attack on southern Israel. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=188.28s)]
*  What impact do you think it has, both on the people who directly experienced it and on [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=192.76s)]
*  the society at large? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=197.0s)]
*  And then, of course, I'm going to then ask you about Gaza, because as we're speaking [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=198.44s)]
*  now, it's estimated that nearly 50,000 people have been killed so far and the number may [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=203.12s)]
*  be greater than that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=209.16s)]
*  Well, let's face it, on October 7th, over 1,200 people were killed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=210.28s)]
*  And that came up as a huge shock to Israelis and many of them experienced it as very [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=215.32s)]
*  traumatic as we were expecting to. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=220.28s)]
*  And that's natural and understandable. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=222.4s)]
*  And one can only feel with them for the shock and the trauma that they experienced. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=224.84s)]
*  All the more so since they grew up in Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=230.92000000000002s)]
*  And I'm speaking as a former Zionist, I'm speaking as a Jew, I'm speaking as somebody [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=234.16s)]
*  who's been to Israel, who's been to the Occupy territory, who's been to Gaza, been to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=239.0s)]
*  the West Bank, has worked with Israeli psychologists and therapists and Palestinian [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=242.56s)]
*  therapists and psychologists. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  The Israeli mentality has always been that we're under attack, we're under threat, they're [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  all against us. And so October 7th was simply more confirmation of what they had already [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=254.0s)]
*  believed. The problem from my point of view is and from anybody's point of view who looks [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=259.8s)]
*  at it objectively, history did not begin on October 7th. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=265.48s)]
*  There's a conflict that's been going on for at least 1947, 48. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=269.24s)]
*  But if you look at it historically, it's been going on for 150 years. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  And so that terrible event of October 7th was one more manifestation of [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=279.12s)]
*  an intractable and generally destructive, traumatic [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=286.68s)]
*  conflict that has beset that area of the world for a long time. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=292.76s)]
*  So as much as we have to recognize the shock and trauma of October 7th, we cannot separate [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=300.56s)]
*  it from the history that preceded it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=305.92s)]
*  You know, obviously, Israelis often feel that they are singled out for sort of a moral [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=308.44s)]
*  scrutiny that is not directed at others. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=314.8s)]
*  But having said that, I'm just wondering if you think overall, does that experience of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  inherited trauma and experience trauma in real time, do you think it's influencing the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=325.12s)]
*  way Israeli leadership and Israeli society is responding to what happened? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=330.88s)]
*  It's interesting that one more time we begin with the experience and subject to the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=336.24s)]
*  response of Israelis. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=342.24s)]
*  Whereas if you look at historically by vast gap, the greatest trauma has been inflicted [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=344.84s)]
*  on the Palestinians for decades. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=352.92s)]
*  But say more about that, then you say more about what you mean by that. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, in just 1947, 48, there were tens of thousands of Palestinians massacred by the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=360.91999999999996s)]
*  Israelis and the Lebanese War. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=370.48s)]
*  Twenty thousand civilians were killed by the Israelis in Lebanon, civilians in, I can [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=374.28000000000003s)]
*  name you multiple massacres of Palestinians documented by Israeli historians. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=380.88s)]
*  I'm not repeating Arab propaganda here. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=387.04s)]
*  I'm telling you what Israeli historians have unearthed and documented and proven [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=389.52000000000004s)]
*  without a shadow of a doubt. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=394.16s)]
*  And in the West, we tend not to talk about that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=396.36s)]
*  We tend to talk about Israelis purely as victims. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=399.36s)]
*  No, surely Israelis have been victimized. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=402.8s)]
*  There's been some terrible terrorism that they've suffered. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=405.44s)]
*  Nobody's questioning that and nobody's justifying it either. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=408.68s)]
*  But it happened in the context. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=412.64s)]
*  So when Israelis believe that they're singled out for criticism, they're not singled out [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=415.04s)]
*  for nearly the criticism that the Palestinian side has received over the decades, despite [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=420.68s)]
*  the fact that the Palestinians have suffered a lot more. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=426.04s)]
*  And I hate to compare suffering, but in terms of numbers and in terms of power, loss of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  lands, oppression, discrimination, there's no comparison in actual practice. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=433.84s)]
*  And anybody who goes there like I have and you see with your own eyes, you can't help [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=441.84s)]
*  but come to that conclusion. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=447.2s)]
*  Now, what's also true that given Jewish history, given the historical and unspeakable [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=449.0s)]
*  suffering of the Jewish people, not just, of course, primarily, but not only during [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=456.72s)]
*  the Nazi genocide, but for hundreds of years before them and decades before them, it's [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  kind of natural for many Jews to perceive themselves as always being under attack. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  And so that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is viewed by them from that lens of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=473.12s)]
*  historical persecution. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=479.36s)]
*  I can understand why that should be the case, but it doesn't make it accurate because it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=480.88s)]
*  removes from the equation the Palestinian experience that we tend not to look at. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=486.4s)]
*  Let's proceed there because, you know, obviously, like as a journalist, I have my own [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=494.15999999999997s)]
*  lens here. And one of the lenses through which I'm looking at this is the fact that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=499.2s)]
*  independent journalists have not been permitted to go to Gaza during this conflict. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=502.88s)]
*  But we have been able to see that there has been vast destruction. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  And we know, according to the health authorities there, that there has been tremendous death and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=511.52s)]
*  suffering. And in some parts of the country, people are on the verge of starvation if they are not [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=516.72s)]
*  starving already. I mean, this has been documented by international agencies that have had [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  access to that area. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=524.88s)]
*  So if you could just describe that, like, what impact do you think this experience? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=526.72s)]
*  I'm recognizing what you said, that this is a moment in time, but just this moment in time [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=531.68s)]
*  for the people who are living through that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=536.32s)]
*  In the journal World Psychiatry in 2006, there was a study of Palestinian kids. This is before [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=538.48s)]
*  Hamas came to power. So let's not begin the assumption that it all started when Hamas took [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  power. This study was done before Hamas took power in Gaza. And 97 percent of Gaza children [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=551.5200000000001s)]
*  showed signs of post-traumatic stress. We're talking 20 years ago now. And many of them [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=560.96s)]
*  wet their beds. I wet my bed till I was 13 years of age as a result of my experience [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=568.32s)]
*  as a Jewish infant in the Second World War under the Nazis. A large percentage of Palestinian [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  kids were wetting their beds over 20 years ago. They had symptoms of nightmares, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=581.52s)]
*  exhibited symptoms of aggression towards their parents. There was a study of Palestinian kids [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=586.88s)]
*  just in December of this last year. 96 percent of them thought that death was imminent. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=593.6s)]
*  They saw 79 percent suffer from nightmares. 73 percent exhibited symptoms of aggression. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=601.44s)]
*  In other words, what was observed in this journal World Psychiatry over 20 years ago [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=608.64s)]
*  has not become that much more exacerbated. That's the reality. And [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=613.52s)]
*  what to say? How can I, given what I've experienced as a Jewish infant and as a Jewish kid growing up [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=622.72s)]
*  under anti-Semitism in Hungary before we came to Canada, how can I not feel with these kids [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=630.48s)]
*  having seen what they've been through, having been there, having seen how they lived even before [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=637.1999999999999s)]
*  this current conflict? So it's a horrendous situation and we can't just restrict our empathy [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=641.44s)]
*  to one side. And we also have to look at the power relationships. I mean, one side has been [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=649.2s)]
*  inflicting it on the other with great preponderance. If you go to the West Bank, as I was there two and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=655.6s)]
*  a half years ago, working with Palestinian women who had been tortured in Israeli jails, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=664.48s)]
*  what you hear all the time is that there's no post-traumatic stress disorder here [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=672.08s)]
*  because the trauma is never post. It's ongoing. And so horrendous as October the 7th was. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=677.2s)]
*  If we're going to deal with this in a humane way, in a human way, in a scientific way, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=685.5200000000001s)]
*  we have to look at the overall context and extend at least as much empathy to one side as to the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=690.4000000000001s)]
*  other. So what is the way forward here when you have people who, I mean, because there's the [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=698.96s)]
*  human suffering and then there's the politics of the moment. And the politics of the moment often [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=706.64s)]
*  either they shape human suffering and they sometimes obliterate or obscure human suffering, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=714.24s)]
*  right? So what's the way forward here? First of all, we have to acknowledge the suffering on all [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=719.84s)]
*  sides and the trauma on all sides. The historical trauma that was the impetus for the Zionist project [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=725.44s)]
*  and the historical trauma that the Zionist project has inflicted on the Palestinian people [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  and continues to. We have to pay more attention, I believe, to those Israelis, the small minority. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=743.12s)]
*  In any country at any time, I mean, there's something very beautiful about Jewish tradition. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=754.96s)]
*  And one of the most beautiful things about Jewish tradition is the prophetic tradition. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=760.48s)]
*  And the prophets weren't people that called out to public opinion. And they didn't call out to the [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=764.88s)]
*  leaders. They said, there's a higher value. There's a higher good. There's a higher God. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=770.5600000000001s)]
*  There's a higher truth than nationalism, than chauvinism, than deference to authority. And it's [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=776.1600000000001s)]
*  to that higher truth that we pay attention to. And there are people in Israel now who advocate that. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=783.2s)]
*  But we rarely hear their voices here in the West. So they need to be paid more attention to. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=790.08s)]
*  I think the unconditional support for the continued suppression of the Palestinians, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=796.32s)]
*  the attack on villages in the West Bank that's going on currently, even after the ceasefire [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=804.96s)]
*  in Gaza, the largely unquestioned acceptance of the Israeli perspective needs to be challenged. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=812.64s)]
*  I think the Palestinians also have to deal with the fact that they've done some horrible things, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=820.3199999999999s)]
*  or some horrible things have been done in their name. They need to deal with that. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=825.84s)]
*  They need to take responsibility for it. I think what I'd like to see, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=830.0s)]
*  is what I'd like to see in general in human life, is that people take responsibility for [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=833.52s)]
*  their own actions. And not to see themselves all the time as victims of the other, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=837.92s)]
*  but to recognize what they've done to the other themselves. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=842.4799999999999s)]
*  Your latest book is The Myth of Normal, Trauma, Illness, and Healing in a Toxic Culture. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=845.52s)]
*  I wrote that with my son Daniel, yes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=850.16s)]
*  What should we draw from this in the current moment? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=852.16s)]
*  Well, what I was pointing out in that book is the inseparability of the mind from the body, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=854.56s)]
*  the unity of mind and body in human health and illness, which also means the inseparability of [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  the individual from the environment. Because our minds and emotions are shaped by our relationships, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=867.04s)]
*  so that you can separate the individual from the culture, from the society, from the community, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=872.88s)]
*  from the history, multi-generationally. So that all kinds of conditions that are [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=879.12s)]
*  thought to be discrete illnesses, and show up as forms of disease, are actually relatable to [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=886.56s)]
*  people's experience in life and to the culture in which they live. Which also means that culture [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=894.4s)]
*  needs to heal as much as individuals need to heal. And in the book, we point out the ways in which [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  trauma shows up in people's lives, personalized health, mental health, physical health, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=909.84s)]
*  addictions, other afflictions, also in social and political life. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=916.56s)]
*  We also point towards some pathways towards healing. So on the whole, the book has a positive message, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  but it does have to begin with looking at how things are very objectively, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=929.9200000000001s)]
*  and not separate phenomena that can't be separated. Not separate the mind from the body, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=935.6800000000001s)]
*  not separate the emotions from the physiology, not separate the individual from the environment, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=942.48s)]
*  not separate the environment from the culture, and not separate the culture from the whole [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=948.32s)]
*  universal world that we all share. But this is where I keep going back to the experience [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=955.44s)]
*  of the Holocaust, and also the experiences that Palestinians have had now. For a lot of people, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=962.64s)]
*  their culture is a source of strength. And if these historical, it's a source of strength, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=970.5600000000001s)]
*  it's a source of identity, it's a source of belonging. I think that's one reason why people [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=976.32s)]
*  call people like you a traitor, because they say, well, how do you disengage from this history that [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=981.2800000000001s)]
*  we share? How do you extricate one from the other? Well, I think you just touched upon a key question [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=987.2s)]
*  in this whole conversation. The thing to realize is trauma is not what happened to us. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=992.48s)]
*  Trauma is what happens inside us as a result of what happened to us. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=999.84s)]
*  So the trauma, let's say, go back to the trauma of me being given by my mother to a stranger in the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1004.88s)]
*  street, which was what happened. And I didn't see her for six weeks. And my life was saved thanks [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1012.4s)]
*  to this Christian woman who conveyed me to some safety. And I didn't see my mother for six weeks. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1017.92s)]
*  But that wasn't the trauma. That was the traumatic event. The trauma was the belief that I developed, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1024.0s)]
*  that I wasn't lovable, because who gets given away? Somebody who's not lovable. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1032.48s)]
*  The trauma wasn't that I didn't see my mother all those weeks. The trauma was [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  that I began to believe in a world that's not safe and in which I don't belong. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1045.68s)]
*  So those traumatic wounds, and trauma literally means wound. So trauma is a wound. It's not the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1053.6s)]
*  wounding event. It's the wound itself. And if we carry a wound in the present from something that [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1059.68s)]
*  happened in the past, we don't have to heal the past. We have to heal the wound in the present. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1067.28s)]
*  And I can heal the wound of believing that I'm not lovable. I can heal the wound that I believe [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1074.48s)]
*  that I live in a world that doesn't accept me or doesn't love or in which I can't find safety. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1081.28s)]
*  I can heal those wounds. So the thing about healing trauma is not to keep looking at the past [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1087.6000000000001s)]
*  and not to be identified by the past, but to ask ourselves, who are we at this present moment [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1094.08s)]
*  as human beings so that the past doesn't define us? It informs us. It explains a lot of things [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1102.0s)]
*  about us, but we're not our past. Dr. Gabor-Malte, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1110.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure to speak with you as well. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlf3pxwInSk&t=1116.64s)]
