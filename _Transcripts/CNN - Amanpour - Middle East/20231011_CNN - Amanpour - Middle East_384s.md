# Survivor of the Hamas Terror Attack on Israeli Music Festival Tells His Story | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8)
*  Sahar Ben Silla barely survived. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=0.0s)]
*  He's shown here dancing with friends [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=3.04s)]
*  just hours before the massacre. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=5.2s)]
*  And I spoke to him from hospital in Tel Aviv, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=7.4s)]
*  and a warning too. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=9.8s)]
*  His story is difficult to hear. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=10.96s)]
*  I want to make it clear first thing first. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=13.84s)]
*  It was a peace festival, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=18.36s)]
*  and we did nothing to provoke them. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=20.2s)]
*  We just was dancing and having fun. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=23.68s)]
*  I can't forget the moment [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  when I got in the festival. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=28.6s)]
*  And I don't know anyone there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=30.8s)]
*  It was something like 30 or 4,000 people. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  And just got into the entrance, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=36.92s)]
*  and just a guy that I don't even know [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=38.72s)]
*  came to me and started to hug me [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=40.92s)]
*  and blessed me for coming for the festival. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=42.92s)]
*  We had a small camp next to us [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=45.36s)]
*  of German people from Germany, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  just tourists who came all over the way [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=49.72s)]
*  from Berlin or wherever they came. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=51.96s)]
*  And we made drinks together. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  We had laughs. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=57.0s)]
*  Just so much happiness. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  What happened to you? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=60.36s)]
*  Tell me how you got wounded. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=61.44s)]
*  I forgot to do that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  It's a big story. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=64.84s)]
*  The first moment that we realized that there is missiles, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=67.16s)]
*  I was really calm in first, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  because it's not the first time that I've seen missiles. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=72.56s)]
*  I was fighting in a Tzuk-eitan, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=75.28s)]
*  and I was doing, I've been serving the army. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=77.64s)]
*  And then I start to watch the missiles, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=80.96s)]
*  and one of the producers of the festival [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=82.84s)]
*  just jumped on the fence [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=85.48s)]
*  and screamed that the terrorists are coming in legs, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=88.12s)]
*  and legs just, they coming on land and not for missile. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=90.72s)]
*  And then the panic began. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=94.44s)]
*  It was a big panic. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=96.48s)]
*  Everybody was jumping on the fence. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=97.72s)]
*  Everybody ran to their cars. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=99.6s)]
*  And it was a lot of fire out there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=101.2s)]
*  Just even in the biggest, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=104.0s)]
*  worst scene that we've seen in movies, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=106.4s)]
*  I can't explain how many bullets and missiles [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  were flying around us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=112.08s)]
*  Not the big missile, like RPG and everything. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=113.68s)]
*  It was RPG all over. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=117.2s)]
*  I was fighting in a war, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=119.12s)]
*  never seen so many RPGs, seriously. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=120.2s)]
*  And how did you get shot? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  Saha, how did you get shot? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=124.72000000000001s)]
*  Part of the story. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  We tried to go to another place, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=129.16s)]
*  and they turn us around again. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  And then we saw a policeman standing next to a shelter [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=132.56s)]
*  and a lot of cars. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  And the policeman look at us and say, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=137.08s)]
*  there is nowhere to run. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=138.56s)]
*  They are all over the place. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=139.8s)]
*  Get inside the shelter. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=141.36s)]
*  It's the only way. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=142.4s)]
*  We got inside the shelters with something, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=144.36s)]
*  I remember 30 or 40 people, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=146.36s)]
*  but my friend says that was 60, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  or even 50 or 60 people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=150.08s)]
*  We got inside the shelter, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=153.28s)]
*  it was something like two meters at all. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=154.12s)]
*  Like just two meters square. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  And we got inside and then the shooting started. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=160.0s)]
*  And the policemen tried to calm us down. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=163.16000000000003s)]
*  It's not the terrorists, it's the IDF, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  but the shooting was on us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  I could see the shots. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=171.0s)]
*  I could feel on the stones of the shelter. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=172.68s)]
*  I could feel the bullets. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=177.68s)]
*  And we scared them. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=180.36s)]
*  It's not IDF, it's not IDF. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=181.44s)]
*  And then just look at us and say, stay inside. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=183.68s)]
*  Pull out the gun. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=187.04s)]
*  And then it was a massive shots all over the place. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=188.24s)]
*  We can see in the entrance of the shelter, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=191.24s)]
*  a lot of bullets flying inside, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=193.76s)]
*  but they couldn't hit us [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=195.36s)]
*  because they can turn left to us. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=196.4s)]
*  Because it was an entrance [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=199.0s)]
*  and then left to the shelter. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=200.36s)]
*  A small something like, even a half a meter. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=202.04s)]
*  Sahar, it sounds to me like you were directed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=205.48s)]
*  to take shelter, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=209.36s)]
*  but you were like a cornered animal in this shelter, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=210.28s)]
*  because that's where the- [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=213.76s)]
*  We didn't take shelter, it wasn't a shelter. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=215.0s)]
*  It was animal slaughter. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=219.24s)]
*  It's like they take all the animals to one place [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=221.84s)]
*  and shoot them all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=224.36s)]
*  And then the policeman got shot and ran away. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  And he killed one of the terrorists, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=229.56s)]
*  but got shot and ran away. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=230.8s)]
*  I found him on Soraka Life and God, the policeman. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=232.6s)]
*  One second, sorry. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=238.4s)]
*  Then they dropped the first grenade, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  dropped inside, it was exploding the entrance. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=246.44s)]
*  I'm sorry, if it's too much, don't talk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=250.88s)]
*  No, it's okay, I need to tell about this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=253.88s)]
*  Just a second, please. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=256.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=258.32s)]
*  After the first grenade, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=260.28s)]
*  after something like 45 seconds, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=262.12s)]
*  he dropped the second grenade, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  and he hit the wall, hit my head, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=267.08s)]
*  and flowed to the back of the people, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=269.76s)]
*  the people have been in the back row, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=272.52s)]
*  and exploded on them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  And then he was like, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=276.68s)]
*  and exploded on them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=277.8s)]
*  And there was something like a lot of smoke inside. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=279.8s)]
*  And my friend, girlfriend, they start to choke, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=283.44s)]
*  and she wanted to go out. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=286.56s)]
*  And she start to run away from the shelter. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=288.24s)]
*  We tried to catch her. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=290.24s)]
*  I remember, I was in the second row of the people. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=291.2s)]
*  I tried to catch her with my hand, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=293.96s)]
*  and it was slipping. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=295.48s)]
*  And she tackled, I think she tackled the terrorist, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=297.76s)]
*  and he shot her dead from zero, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=301.4s)]
*  from zero, how can I say? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=304.44s)]

*  He was smiling at us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=318.56s)]
*  It looks like the devil. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=320.32000000000005s)]
*  He just looked at us, point the gun, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=321.88000000000005s)]
*  the Karlo machine gun, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=324.44000000000005s)]
*  in front of the girl face, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=326.56s)]
*  and just start to spread everything around. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=328.88s)]
*  All the people, I was in the second row. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=331.8s)]
*  All the people in the first row, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=334.44s)]
*  in the second row, shot dead. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=335.76s)]
*  I just opened my eyes, and opened my mouth, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=338.52s)]
*  and start to go down the wall, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=341.52s)]
*  because I got, I understood that I got hit, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=343.36s)]
*  but didn't understand where yet, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=346.04s)]
*  because it was blood all over and screaming. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=347.84s)]
*  And from all the adrenaline, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=350.32s)]
*  I got hit in my body, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=351.72s)]
*  but I can't really understand what happens. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=353.0s)]
*  And I think his gun was broken, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=356.0s)]
*  that's why he stopped to shot. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=358.24s)]
*  And there was a third grenade inside the building, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=359.72s)]
*  but it didn't explode. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=362.84s)]
*  We found him on the floor. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=364.08s)]
*  We say that we don't want to touch it, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=365.59999999999997s)]
*  so it won't explode. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKeVAQw5tE8&t=367.52s)]
