Video Description: Although Israeli forces killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar last week, Israel is still stepping up its military campaign in Gaza. Over the weekend, strikes on a residential building in northern Gaza killed dozens of people. In Lebanon, Israel’s campaign is straying farther from military targets, attacking branches of a Hezbollah financial center which is used by many civilians as a bank. Meanwhile, a Hezbollah drone has hit the private residence of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. No injuries have been reported. All this comes against a backdrop of public statements by President Biden encouraging Israel to use this moment as an opportunity to turn the page. Ryan Crocker, a former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and other posts across the region, joins Christiane.

# Former U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Discusses the War After Sinwar’s Death | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw)
*  Welcome, Ryan Crocker, Ambassador from Britain, where no doubt you're being able to absorb [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=0.0s)]
*  the international sentiment about the elections and about what's happening in the Middle East. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=6.2s)]
*  So let's just get going with the first question. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=11.88s)]
*  Is this a moment, do you think, where Israel and the region can step off the road to war [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=15.52s)]
*  or not? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=22.6s)]
*  I think there is a moment, provided both sides and outside parties such as the United States [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=26.06s)]
*  think small and think realistically. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=33.38s)]
*  The death of Sinwar clearly was a major blow to Hamas and a major achievement for Israel, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=36.86s)]
*  but it doesn't fundamentally alter the terms of the conflict. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  And similarly, the decapitation of the Hezbollah leadership in Lebanon, as we have seen, very [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=49.46s)]
*  dramatically with that drone strike that hit the prime minister's residence, has not [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=55.74s)]
*  curtailed their ability to fire missiles across the border. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  So I would urge all parties to think small, think in terms of a ceasefire that can save [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=64.94s)]
*  lives in Lebanon and among Palestinians in Gaza and of supreme importance, give the chance [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=70.98s)]
*  to get the hostages back alive. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=79.42s)]
*  But this is not the moment in which we see a fundamental shift in the dynamics of the [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=81.9s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=86.9s)]
*  But can I ask you, because you say the death of Sinwar hasn't fundamentally changed the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=87.9s)]
*  dynamic on the ground, so I guess Israel would say the same thing, that yes, we've killed [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=92.94000000000001s)]
*  him but the war continues. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=98.58000000000001s)]
*  And it's really, they're going at it in an extremely sort of stepped up way. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=100.5s)]
*  And likewise, in Lebanon, we heard today Israel saying we will strike Lebanon until Hezbollah [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=107.04s)]
*  collapses. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Do you think it's possible for Israel to achieve those maximalist goals? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=114.76s)]
*  You were ambassador to Lebanon when Hezbollah was formed, I think. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=119.44000000000001s)]
*  I was assigned to the embassy in Lebanon when Hezbollah was formed as a result of the Israeli [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=125.48s)]
*  invasion in 1982 and the subsequent occupation of southern Lebanon. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=131.48000000000002s)]
*  That was the birth of Hezbollah. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  And let's remember that that operation, that invasion in 1982 was called Operation Peace [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=139.94s)]
*  for Galilee, intended to eliminate the threat of armed action by the Palestine Liberation [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=145.48s)]
*  Organization across the border, whether by infiltration or by artillery fire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=152.54s)]
*  Well, 42 years later, we are very far from Peace for Galilee with 60,000 Israelis evacuated [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=157.98s)]
*  from their communities. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=164.22s)]
*  It was an Israeli occupation that gave birth to Hezbollah. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  Another Israeli occupation is highly unlikely to eliminate Hezbollah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=171.14s)]
*  Let me just put it that way. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  And yet, obviously, you've just mentioned that those 60,000 civilians and others have [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=176.94s)]
*  been moved from their places of residence in northern Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=181.33999999999997s)]
*  And you know that Hezbollah started to fire on October 8th in support of Hamas. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=185.61999999999998s)]
*  So what would you advise, having known so much and absorbed so much, not just in Lebanon, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=190.94s)]
*  but you know, we mentioned Iraq after the invasion, Afghanistan, all these places that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=196.78s)]
*  have dealt with the attempt to change regimes and to stamp out militantism? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=201.82s)]
*  Well, the harder one stamps, the more militants one seems to engender. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=211.94s)]
*  So again, I think the imperative has to be every effort possible to get a ceasefire in [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=217.3s)]
*  the north, in Lebanon, and a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=221.82s)]
*  That is not going to be easy, but it is, I think, just possible. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=226.94s)]
*  And I commend the Biden administration and Secretary Blinken in particular for making [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=230.74s)]
*  the effort at this delicate juncture. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=235.22s)]
*  There are two different conflicts, obviously. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=238.18s)]
*  In Lebanon, there is the architecture for a cessation of hostilities that rests in UN [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=242.34s)]
*  Security Council Resolution 1701 that was passed after the Hezbollah-Israeli conflict [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  of 2006. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  That would call for a deployment of the Lebanese army throughout the south, the cessation of [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=257.18s)]
*  any armed action by any party that the Lebanese government, assisted by the United Nations [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=264.3s)]
*  interim force in Lebanon, would have the sole monopoly of power and that Israel would withdraw [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=270.86s)]
*  its forces. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=275.9s)]
*  It might be that Israel, because again, the decapitation of the Hezbollah leadership has [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=277.78s)]
*  not stopped the rocket fire, that Israel might be interested right now in a cessation of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=284.46s)]
*  hostilities in which they could claim at least a victory of sorts by eliminating the command [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=290.38s)]
*  of their adversary. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=295.36s)]
*  And it might be that Hezbollah and Iran behind them would also welcome a ceasefire at this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=297.34s)]
*  point to regroup and reorganize. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=303.09999999999997s)]
*  But again, there should be no illusion on the part of anyone that the killing of Nasrullah [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=306.38s)]
*  and so many of his other commanders fundamentally alters the will or the ability of Hezbollah [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=314.38s)]
*  to prosecute this military campaign. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PH7N5LhhAw&t=319.98s)]
