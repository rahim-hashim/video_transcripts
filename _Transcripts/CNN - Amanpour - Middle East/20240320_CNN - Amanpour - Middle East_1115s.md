# Israeli Knesset Member: Gaza Crisis “Could Not Happen” Without U.S. Support | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [March 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4)
*  Now, as we reported earlier, there are loud and differing voices within Israel on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=0.0s)]
*  so-called day after the war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=5.68s)]
*  We heard the extreme settler view earlier, and left-wing lawmaker Ofer Kasif is just [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  as passionate about opposing that and opposing Netanyahu's handling of the war, stressing [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=13.86s)]
*  the need for a political solution. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  And he joins Michel Martin now to explain why and how he survived the recent effort [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  to impeach him. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=26.64s)]
*  Thanks, Christian. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=28.28s)]
*  Knesset member, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=29.28s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=32.88s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=33.88s)]
*  An honor. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=34.88s)]
*  Before we get into recent events, I wanted to go back a little bit to last month. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=35.88s)]
*  You've been very critical of the Netanyahu government. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=41.92s)]
*  You have argued, and you have made no secret of the fact, that you think that this government [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=45.8s)]
*  has been engaging in many sort of anti-democratic efforts, trying to silence dissent, silence [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=51.08s)]
*  any criticism, cracking down on public demonstrations that would be customary in a democracy. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  How did you find out—and I understand that this is your fellow Knesset members who would [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=67.84s)]
*  move to impeach you, but how did you find out that they were moving to impeach you? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=72.0s)]
*  Well, there is a law in Israel that was enacted in 2016 that allows a majority of 90 members [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=77.0s)]
*  of the Knesset out of 120 to impeach another member of the Knesset if one is accused in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  either supporting racism or supporting an armed struggle against Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Now, after I signed this petition, which I guess we will discuss later about, I realized [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  that one member of the Knesset, a far-right member of the Knesset, began in getting signatures [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=105.24000000000001s)]
*  from other members of the Knesset in order to begin a motion to impeach you. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=114.64s)]
*  So that's how I knew about it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  And the rest is for history, more or less. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  The specific action that you were accused of is in relation to your decision to support [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  the petition to the International Criminal Court that would have investigated Israel [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=133.6s)]
*  in relation to its actions in Gaza. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=138.84s)]
*  South Africa has asked for Israel to be investigated, and you said that you feel that this is an [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=142.24s)]
*  appropriate thing to do. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=147.72s)]
*  As briefly as you can, why did you feel that that was important to do? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=149.84s)]
*  Well, there are two main things that, first of all, you know, I do not trust any government [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=153.88s)]
*  to investigate itself. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=160.36s)]
*  It's not necessarily only the Israeli government, but any government. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=162.16s)]
*  I think that the basis of democracy is that anyone should cast doubts on one's own government. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=166.76s)]
*  Since 1949, the state of Israel itself joined to this convention on genocide and actually [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=174.28s)]
*  recognizes the authority of the ICJ in investigating such accusations. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=181.76s)]
*  So for me, it was very clear that the ICJ is the authority to investigate the ongoing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=189.44s)]
*  in Gaza, not the Israeli government itself. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=197.4s)]
*  That was one thing. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  The other is that in the appeal of South Africa, as well as in the petition that I joined, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=201.96s)]
*  and eventually, by the way, there were almost 1,000 Israeli citizens who signed this petition, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=209.6s)]
*  there was a very clear call to stop the war. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  We all know that the death toll of Palestinians in Gaza is more than 30,000. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  And there are also Israeli soldiers and hostages. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  We want everyone to leave. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=231.28s)]
*  We don't want victims anymore. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  So it was very clear for me. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=237.92s)]
*  Because the government of Israel is not interested in the lives of anyone, neither the Israelis [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=239.88s)]
*  let alone the Palestinians. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=245.4s)]
*  So I found myself obliged to appeal to an international body such as ICJ. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=247.72s)]
*  The effort to impeach you failed. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=254.28s)]
*  It did receive a significant number of votes, but not enough to obviously move forward with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=256.04s)]
*  the impeachment. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=261.92s)]
*  You clearly have not been cowed by this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=263.32s)]
*  This week, you gave a speech on the floor of the Knesset in support of the Biden administration's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=266.08s)]
*  sanctions against settlers in the West Bank. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  Why do you believe that that is the right course of action? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  Why do you believe that it is appropriate for the administration to place sanctions [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=275.72s)]
*  on these settlers? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=279.24s)]
*  Because, as you know, that's—it's very controversial for a number of reasons. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=280.24s)]
*  Many people think it's sort of minimalist. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  Some people think it's the wrong people. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  Some people think it's a band-aid. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=286.98s)]
*  It doesn't really address the situation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=289.6s)]
*  Many opinions. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=292.36s)]
*  But why do you think it was an appropriate course of action? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=293.36s)]
*  I may accept all the things you said, but still it doesn't rule out the sanctions. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=295.56s)]
*  I agree that the main, you know, body that should be sanctioned is the Israeli government. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=302.0s)]
*  They are responsible—the government is responsible for the ongoing pogroms that settlers carry [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=309.35999999999996s)]
*  out against Palestinians in the West Bank. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=316.68s)]
*  Look, I want to be very, very blunt and very, very clear. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=318.79999999999995s)]
*  There is an ethnic cleansing going on in the West Bank. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=322.88s)]
*  Before the massacre of October, I've been literally three or four days before the massacre, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=327.8s)]
*  the terrible massacre, the criminal massacre that Hamas committed, in which I personally [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=334.32s)]
*  lost some friends. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=339.0s)]
*  It's very important to say that we totally condemn it, because, again, some people believe [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=340.0s)]
*  that if I'm against the war and against the occupation, that means that I support the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=345.32s)]
*  crimes of Hamas. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  So I want to be very clear about that too. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=351.15999999999997s)]
*  So three or four days before the massacre committed by Hamas, I visited the Jordan Valley, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=355.03999999999996s)]
*  some pastoral communities of Palestinian ones in the West Bank, and I realized then that [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=361.23999999999995s)]
*  already four communities were totally eliminated. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=367.47999999999996s)]
*  They had to flee because of the ongoing daily pogroms committed by settlers under the auspices [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  of the occupation forces. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=378.35999999999996s)]
*  We are talking about a size, a territory, double than the city of Tel Aviv. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=380.44s)]
*  And since October 7th, it has risen into Palestinian communities that literally perished. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=386.2s)]
*  There's an ongoing ethnic cleansing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=394.59999999999997s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  You're saying that in the West Bank—we're not talking about Gaza now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=396.59999999999997s)]
*  We're saying in the West Bank. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=398.84s)]
*  I'm talking about the West Bank. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=399.84s)]
*  You believe that the settlers are making an effort to drive Palestinians out by force. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=400.84s)]
*  Successful efforts. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=405.84s)]
*  Successful efforts. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=406.84s)]
*  More than 20 communities, Palestinian communities, of innocent shepherds, poor people that I [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  visited. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=415.96s)]
*  I know many of them personally. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=416.96s)]
*  Good people have nothing to do with, you know, violence or whatever. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=418.96s)]
*  They are assaulted on a continuous basis, a daily basis, for at least four years, actually. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  It's been more than exactly one year. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=434.0s)]
*  Once I first sent a letter to your Afghan, the defense minister of Israel, and I sent [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=437.08s)]
*  him that letter as a member of the Knesset. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=443.64s)]
*  I said to him, there are pogroms going on by settlers against the Palestinians in the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=452.79999999999995s)]
*  Please stop it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=453.79999999999995s)]
*  You have to stop it first because it's criminal and secondly because it's going to blow up [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  the whole region. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=461.91999999999996s)]
*  Everybody is going to pay the price. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=464.12s)]
*  There's going to be a bloodshed that we've never experienced. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=466.08s)]
*  I said that eight, seven months before the massacre of October 7th. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=469.12s)]
*  And ever since I sent, I guess, another 10 letters of the same kind, up to now I haven't [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  got even one reply from the minister. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=481.96s)]
*  One reply. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=484.56s)]
*  Do you think the Israeli public sees what you see in Gaza and the West Bank? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=485.56s)]
*  No. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=492.12s)]
*  The media in Israel, the media in Israel, voluntarily, by the way, it's not, you know, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=493.72s)]
*  it's not something that the government has been doing or forcing the media to do. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=501.28000000000003s)]
*  The media, apart from very few, totally hides or ignores from the ongoing in Gaza and in [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=509.72s)]
*  the West Bank. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=519.76s)]
*  Nobody actually knows about it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=520.76s)]
*  And the vast majority don't want to know about it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=522.96s)]
*  It's because it's very hard to see a villain when you look at the mirror. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  The polls in Israel show high support for Israel's war in Gaza. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  In January, there was a group, the Israel Democracy Institute, which I think is a respected [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=536.22s)]
*  research institute, said that 56 percent of Israelis polled in January said continuing [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=540.32s)]
*  the military offensive was the best way to recover the hostages. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=546.24s)]
*  Yet, the prime minister, Netanyahu, is not popular. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=550.76s)]
*  That same poll found that only 15 percent want Netanyahu to be prime minister once the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=554.28s)]
*  war is over. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=559.56s)]
*  How do you understand that? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=560.56s)]
*  Well, many people in Israel put the blame, or at least some of the responsibility, for [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=561.88s)]
*  the massacre of October 7 on Netanyahu. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=567.04s)]
*  And justly so. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=571.08s)]
*  He is responsible. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=572.08s)]
*  He is responsible for his long-going policy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=573.08s)]
*  He said explicitly in 2019, and I quote him almost word by word, he said, those who oppose [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=577.24s)]
*  a Palestinian state, like he does, must weaken the Palestinian authority and strengthen Hamas. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=585.12s)]
*  He said so. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=593.5600000000001s)]
*  He said so. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=594.5600000000001s)]
*  Even Smotrich in 2015 said, and I quote, the Palestinian authority is a burden. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  Hamas is an asset. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=604.04s)]
*  He said so. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=605.68s)]
*  They wanted Hamas to be strong as part of the classic colonialist divide and rule. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=606.68s)]
*  And they want the bigots of Hamas to be stronger in order to find an excuse and say that there's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=613.4s)]
*  no one to talk to. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=619.88s)]
*  They wanted it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=622.0799999999999s)]
*  They passed Netanyahu himself for more than 10 years, allowed millions of dollars to get [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=623.64s)]
*  to the pockets of Hamas from Qatar. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=630.04s)]
*  It's not a secret. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=633.16s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=634.16s)]
*  He is responsible. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=635.24s)]
*  And people, because of that, many Israelis don't want him as a prime minister. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=636.24s)]
*  And justly so. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  They say, you are responsible. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=641.9599999999999s)]
*  You are guilty. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  Some even say you are guilty. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=643.9599999999999s)]
*  At the same time, many of them think that the war must go on. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course, I'm not there. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  I have my own criticism. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=653.76s)]
*  But we do not agree about the war, the assault. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=654.76s)]
*  There are many that do agree with me, especially among the families of the hostages. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=658.76s)]
*  Not all of them. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=664.96s)]
*  Many of the families of the hostages and the victims who were butchered by Hamas understand [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=665.96s)]
*  that this assault on Gaza will not deliver neither security for the Israelis, say for [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  the Israelis, sorry, nor, let alone, release of the hostages. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  More and more people begin to understand that. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=686.24s)]
*  And I believe that the atmosphere is shifting slowly, gradually. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=688.5600000000001s)]
*  But it is shifting because of that, of this situation. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=694.24s)]
*  So let us turn now to the U.S. role here. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=699.08s)]
*  First, there was the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a senator from New York. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=701.76s)]
*  I would say the sort of highest ranking, most prominent Jewish elected official in the United [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  States said that the Netanyahu government should go, that the prime minister is not [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=712.96s)]
*  serving the interests of the people. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=717.64s)]
*  This caused a huge reaction. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=719.32s)]
*  And then, according to the White House, President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=720.76s)]
*  just this week to warn against this planned military operation that we are told is coming [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=725.3199999999999s)]
*  in Ra'afah, saying that a major ground operation there would be a mistake. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=731.7199999999999s)]
*  What do you make of these developments, particularly the White House? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=738.0s)]
*  Do you think that this is consequential? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=741.64s)]
*  Look, I must say I'm very critical of the White House and then of Biden's administration, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=742.64s)]
*  because actually without their consent, the assault on Gaza and this terrible death toll [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=748.2s)]
*  would have never occurred. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=753.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean, there is a kind of, you know, if you allow me to use some concepts from psychology, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  there is a kind of dissonance cognitive, because, you know, dissonance cognitive is when one [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=763.0s)]
*  consciously clinging to two contradictory or more contradictory moments. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=770.0799999999999s)]
*  And that's what I see in the behavior of President Biden, because on the one hand, he speaks [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=777.76s)]
*  about the dire situation, the grave situation of the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=784.64s)]
*  They are starving there. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=790.96s)]
*  So, and so it is a starvation caused by Israel. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=792.48s)]
*  And of course, no medicine or hospital, destruction, death toll, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=796.9599999999999s)]
*  That could not happen without the support of the United States. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=806.0799999999999s)]
*  Because I give you two examples, which for me are the main ones. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  First of all, every time there's a motion in criticism of Israel in the Security Council [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=812.4s)]
*  of the United Nations, the United States vetoes the decision. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=820.4s)]
*  That's a support which I do not accept. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=827.04s)]
*  I want to be very clear. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=830.0s)]
*  It's not a support for Israel and the Israelis. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=831.36s)]
*  It's support for the Israeli government, which is against the Israelis. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=833.84s)]
*  I am as an opposition. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=838.56s)]
*  I am committed to the Israeli public, and I'm trying to do my job. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  And part of my job is to stand still against the government if the government is wrong, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=848.24s)]
*  let alone sins. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=854.88s)]
*  And the Biden administration in supporting the government of Israel is acting against [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=857.04s)]
*  justice, against the Palestinians, but also against the Israelis. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=863.6s)]
*  But except that public opinion, as we've discussed, does not support this government per se, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=867.36s)]
*  but it does support what the government is doing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=872.0799999999999s)]
*  Knesset member, your views are not in the majority. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=874.1600000000001s)]
*  First of all, you may be right. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=879.76s)]
*  That doesn't undermine my obligation to raise my voice and to represent the thousands and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=882.4000000000001s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of Israelis who do support my view. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=891.6s)]
*  And they let a lot of people out of Israel. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=896.72s)]
*  But I guess that we both would agree that polls are mainly for statistics, but not for [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=899.2800000000001s)]
*  political decisions. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  The White House has said that Mr. Biden asked Prime Minister Netanyahu to send a delegation [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=910.32s)]
*  of intelligence and military officials to Washington to hear firsthand the White House's [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=917.36s)]
*  views, particularly about this planned incursion into Ra'a. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=923.2800000000001s)]
*  We are told that the government, the Netanyahu government, has agreed to send such a [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=926.08s)]
*  delegation. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=930.24s)]
*  Does that offer any hope to you? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=931.12s)]
*  I don't know if you heard how Netanyahu explained sending the delegation. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=933.5200000000001s)]
*  He said that he's been doing that for, and I quote, for respect, because he respects [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=937.9200000000001s)]
*  Biden, Mr. Biden, not because he wants to achieve something or he's ready to, you know, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=947.12s)]
*  to refrain from operating in Ra'a. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=956.48s)]
*  I think that to say that the invading to Ra'a is wrong, it's an understatement. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=961.04s)]
*  It's going to be a carnage. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=968.7199999999999s)]
*  It's the death toll that's going to be there, the bloodshed that's going to be there, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  is going to be even more disastrous than what has been going thus far. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=977.6s)]
*  Before we let you go, clearly, you remain as outspoken as ever. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=983.7600000000001s)]
*  Do you feel that you are opening up more democratic space, you know, more space for [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  public criticism or to sort of maintain these democratic traditions of sort of public dissent? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=997.2s)]
*  You know, you probably know this story that just after the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1005.28s)]
*  America, United States invaded Vietnam, there was one person who used to demonstrate in [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1011.2s)]
*  front of the White House, and every time he was asked, what are you doing here alone, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1016.32s)]
*  you know that you're all alone. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1020.64s)]
*  Everybody supports the invasion of the assault of Vietnam. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  And he used to answer, according to the story, he was told by many that he was not going to [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1026.16s)]
*  change society. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1033.68s)]
*  So he used to say, perhaps I'm not going to change society, but I'm standing here in order [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1034.64s)]
*  to make sure that society doesn't change me. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1039.2s)]
*  But eventually, going back to this story, we know that this guy probably did change society [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1042.8s)]
*  because we know what happened later. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1049.04s)]
*  So answering your question by using this story, I do believe not only me, but thousands of [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1051.84s)]
*  people, we went to demonstrate in front of the American embassy, you know, a couple of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1059.76s)]
*  days ago, in calling for the United States to recognize the Palestinian state. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1065.52s)]
*  So it's not only me. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  It will be very egocentric to say it's me. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1075.52s)]
*  But people like me, me together, we are the hope for both peoples of this land, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1078.24s)]
*  including the Israelis. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1086.24s)]
*  Knesset member Ofer Kasif, thank you so much for speaking with us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1088.32s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1092.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1092.88s)]
*  Have a nice day. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1093.28s)]
*  And the Israeli government has consistently denied any attempt to strengthen Hamas. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1095.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmPsguWSTw4&t=1108.24s)]
