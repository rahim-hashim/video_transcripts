Video Description: Protestors are blocking highways and raising their voices in Israel today, calling for the release of hostages as they mark 600 days since the horrors of the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023 that caused more than 1,200 deaths and the taking of 251 hostages. For Gazans, it has meant 600 days of Israel’s devastating war. More than 54,000 people are dead, entire families wiped out, and Gaza is increasingly a scene of hunger and desperation. Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, fewer than half believed to be alive. Despite international pressure piling on the Israeli government to end its renewed offensive, the nominee to be the new head of Israel’s security agency has reportedly said that he opposes hostage deals. Omer Shem Tov was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and taken to Gaza, where he was held for more than 500 days. In February, he was released during the temporary ceasefire. Bianna Golodryga spoke to Shem Tov in New York about what he went through, and what he is focused on now.

*  now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=16.34s)]
*  Omar Shemtov, thank you so much for taking the time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=17.34s)]
*  It's so great to finally meet you in person. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=21.92s)]
*  It's been three months since your release. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=25.26s)]
*  It has been a whirlwind. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=28.42s)]
*  I can only imagine you've traveled the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=29.52s)]
*  You've been meeting with world leaders. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=31.8s)]
*  You've been speaking throughout the opening pitch at Fenway Park. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=33.92s)]
*  What have these three months now that you've had freedom again been like for you? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=39.16s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=42.96s)]
*  It's been a crazy three months. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=48.8s)]
*  I was just released. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=56.32s)]
*  I got back home and I got right into this... [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=58.14s)]
*  You know, I'm going all around the place. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=67.98s)]
*  I'm speaking and it's non-stop. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=70.06s)]
*  It's non-stop. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=73.9s)]
*  There is this feeling of guilt, you know, for me that I'm here today. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=74.9s)]
*  I'm home and the 58 remaining hostages are back there and I know what they're going [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  through right now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  They're going through hell and time is critical. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=94.68s)]
*  So for me, I do feel it's my responsibility. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=102.64000000000001s)]
*  I do feel I must do it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  This feeling of guilt doesn't let you go. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=112.25999999999999s)]
*  You know, every time I eat something, I think about, let's say, Alon Oel, yeah, that he's [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=115.89999999999999s)]
*  there maybe he's not eating something. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=125.22s)]
*  Maybe he doesn't have something to eat. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=127.38s)]
*  Every time I take a shower, maybe I think of a Gali and Zivi. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=130.14s)]
*  They're there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=134.5s)]
*  They cannot take a shower. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=135.5s)]
*  Everything I do, everywhere I walk, I can feel it here sometimes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=138.12s)]
*  You know, I feel like I'm being choked. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=144.76s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=148.51999999999998s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  I... [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  We, as a society, we as the released hostages, we feel like we have to do it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  You say you know what the hostages are experiencing and going through right now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Can you take us back to October 7th for you? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=165.46s)]
*  2023, you were kidnapped along with your friends, Maya and Itai Regev, brother and sister. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=169.38s)]
*  You were beaten, thrown into the backseat of a car and thrown into a hostile environment [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=177.18s)]
*  in Gaza, to say the least. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=184.94s)]
*  Can you talk about those first few days when you were separated from Maya? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=187.34s)]
*  At some point she was injured and you were alone in a room with Itai for about 50 days [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=192.0s)]
*  until he was released. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  At that time, it was very difficult for us. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=200.0s)]
*  But we had each other. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=206.56s)]
*  Me and Itai, we had each other. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=207.88s)]
*  So it was really comforting that you have someone with you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  And also Itai, I felt like he's my brother. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=219.74s)]
*  We have a really good bond. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=225.66s)]
*  We have a really good connection. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=227.62s)]
*  So although it was scary and every moment could be our last, we were together. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=229.9s)]
*  I really did feel like in those 53 days that I have something to lay on, I have someone [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=244.32s)]
*  to put my head on. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=255.52s)]
*  Although we had to help each other. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=258.24s)]
*  So it was difficult. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=263.0s)]
*  Of course it was very difficult. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=267.12s)]
*  If it's the hunger, the dark, the loneliness. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=269.18s)]
*  I spent some time with Itai and Maya and he said he wouldn't have survived without you. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=283.58000000000004s)]
*  You saved his life literally as an older brother there with him through those 53 days. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=291.90000000000003s)]
*  And maintaining your faith, trying to celebrate Shabbat any way you could. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=299.16s)]
*  And he felt immense guilt leaving you behind. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=305.0s)]
*  I know you know that and that's the same guilt I would imagine you feel about the 58 hostages [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=307.52s)]
*  that remain in Gaza. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=312.32s)]
*  After those 53 days when you were separated from Itai, things only got worse for you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=314.12s)]
*  The remainder of your time in Gaza was in an underground tunnel all alone by yourself. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=319.12s)]
*  Can you talk about that experience? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=326.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=328.9s)]
*  So when Itai left, he was brought back home. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=330.53999999999996s)]
*  I was very happy for him. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=336.65999999999997s)]
*  I was. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=340.5s)]
*  But at the same time I felt like I was left behind. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=341.5s)]
*  And that feeling of you know you feel like when you feel like they're forgetting you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=348.54s)]
*  That was the hardest thing for me there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fjomvTyzP0&t=357.68s)]
