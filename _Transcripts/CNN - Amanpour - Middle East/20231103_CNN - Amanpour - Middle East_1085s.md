# Why the Middle East Conflict Means “Off the Charts” Threat Levels in U.S. | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w)
*  We return to the Israel Hamas war and the global repercussions. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=0.0s)]
*  Here in the United States, anti-Semitism threats have reached historic levels and anti-Arab sentiments are on the rise. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=4.08s)]
*  College campuses are struggling to manage the outbreak of protests and uptick in hate. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=10.32s)]
*  Hari Sreenivasan talks to national security expert Juliette Kayem about how this conflict is dividing America. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=15.52s)]
*  Yanda, thanks Juliette Kayem. Thanks so much for joining us. First, let's start with some of the images that we have seen of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=22.56s)]
*  very few numbers of people actually being able to leave [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=29.52s)]
*  Gaza and to get into Egypt. And we should say that for a lot of these, these are Americans [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=34.24s)]
*  who are finally getting a way out. Let's talk about some of the complexity in organizing this and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=41.04s)]
*  how long this could take. Right. This will take a very long time. The numbers we're seeing are mere trickles from the couple hundred [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=47.199999999999996s)]
*  that we know of US citizens that are stuck [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza right now. The complexity is this, is that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=57.6s)]
*  basically [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=62.16s)]
*  the United States needs to find an honest broker [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=63.28s)]
*  to make sure that the movement of the citizens is safe. And that will probably be a third party, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=67.68s)]
*  either Egypt or, or, or Qatar's in terms of getting that passage. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=74.24s)]
*  So you have to make sure that they can get safely to the border and then through the border once they're in Egypt, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=78.64s)]
*  they're, they're taken care of. What the United States doesn't want to do, at least right now, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=85.12s)]
*  is to have any military presence that would suggest that we're getting involved on the ground to assist [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=89.68s)]
*  and even the extraction of our citizens. So you hear people talk about, well, the Navy's there. Why can't we get a ship there? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=95.92s)]
*  It's not that easy. Our ships would then be vulnerable if they're attacked or anything happens, then you're, you're, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  you're increasing the, the threat to the United States and to those citizens. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=108.16s)]
*  Hurry, there's a third factor, which is what do the US citizens want to do there? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=112.88s)]
*  It's terrifying there as we know if they're stuck in Gaza City, to get them to feel confident to leave [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=116.8s)]
*  in, onto open roads down [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  Gaza to Egypt is also a, you know, I mean, basically they're going to be making their own risk calculation at this stage. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=127.36s)]
*  Well, let's talk a little bit about Christopher Wray, the head of the FBI, who testified [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=137.28s)]
*  in front of Congress earlier this week, and he had a lot of different warnings. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=142.56s)]
*  And we had, first of all, I mean, I guess that one of the headlines was to raise the threat level because he is concerned about [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=146.16s)]
*  attacks here on US soil by a varying number of different actors. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=152.4s)]
*  Why, why does the FBI take this, this step now? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=157.44s)]
*  Right. So, so immediately after the terror attack by Hamas, the threat levels, or there, there was a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=160.56s)]
*  warning to local and state law enforcement. Then that gets very specific in which [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  a local and state law enforcement are told by the federal government, you know, the Jewish community is under particular threat [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=172.32s)]
*  because of what we were seeing online or what the US was seeing online and because of obviously the atmospherics. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=178.64s)]
*  Then that a third time increases to an overall increase in the national threat level. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=184.32s)]
*  We don't use a color system anymore here in the United States. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=191.12s)]
*  Christopher Wray, the FBI director, then testifies to say it is, it is essentially off the charts now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=194.16s)]
*  That's happening for a variety of reasons. One is, of course, the conflict abroad is animating and energizing a lot of political interest and religious interests here [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=200.08s)]
*  that are getting, that are for the most part the appropriate, you know, First Amendment right to, to, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=209.76s)]
*  to have an opinion, but in some instances do, do become violent. The second is the right wing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=216.16s)]
*  white supremacist apparatus that, that has always been anti-Semitic is, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=223.36s)]
*  is playing off of this conflict to draw others into their sort of historic anti-Semitism. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  The third piece is of course foreign actors taking advantage of [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=239.36s)]
*  our fights, our political fights, our religious fights, and I mean, you know, verbal fights and protests taking advantage of it and amplifying [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  and, and, and creating disinformation about what's happening here. So all three of those things combined [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=253.52s)]
*  have now increased the, the threat environment for of course Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, but in particular [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=260.24s)]
*  Jewish Americans and the Jewish community, and that's why you're seeing local and state law enforcement, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=266.98s)]
*  you know, fortify or, or be present at synagogues and, and try to protect that community. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=273.14000000000004s)]
*  So let's break that down a little bit. I mean, he, he said both [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=278.5s)]
*  homegrown violent extremists as well as domestic violent extremists. I think for our audience, what is the difference there? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  So the, the, the homegrown is, is the groups, like the right wing groups that, whose names like, you know, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=288.66s)]
*  vary depending, who have always been [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=296.58s)]
*  violent and have organized around [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=301.54s)]
*  anti-Semitism. The, the domestic terrorist threat they're viewing as maybe sort of a, not sort of, but as a lone wolf. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=305.12s)]
*  Someone who's just going to become animated, no tie to an organization, maybe doesn't even know what they feel, who, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=312.1s)]
*  you know, people get [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=319.22s)]
*  inspired by this language, inspired by the hate, inspired by the sort of [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=321.14s)]
*  lack of, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=326.58s)]
*  you know, sort of, I guess I would say just like lack of ability to show empathy for either side. Like each side is sort of, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  you know, more animated than maybe it ought to be. You mentioned earlier that we are [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=334.34000000000003s)]
*  not in a color-coded system in the United States right now, but if we were, we'd be kind of off the charts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=339.38s)]
*  Spell that out for us. What is that threshold? Where, what is, how do we get to an 11? Yeah, exactly. So, so, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=344.9s)]
*  that people remember after 9-11, which there's a lot of analogies to right now in terms of some of the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=351.3s)]
*  domestic issues going on, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=357.7s)]
*  that there was a color-code system of which sort of was roundly criticized because no one actually knew what to do if it [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=359.7s)]
*  went up to red alert or orange or yellow. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=366.26s)]
*  And so it's been replaced essentially with a narrative, and which you heard [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=369.22s)]
*  FBI Director Christopher Wray tell, which is the, these are the numbers that were seen in terms of [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=374.82s)]
*  the increased threat level, right? You have a population that's barely, Jewish population is barely 3% of the United States [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=381.06s)]
*  population receiving over 70% of the, of the hate-filled [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=388.16s)]
*  ugliness that we're seeing [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=393.94s)]
*  online and the kind of thing that the FBI has been paying attention to. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=395.94s)]
*  So basically when Christopher Wray says that, or Secretary of Homeland Security, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=400.74s)]
*  Majorca says that, they are basically [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=405.04s)]
*  talking to different [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=408.1s)]
*  different constituencies. The first is your local state, tribal, territorial law enforcement, which is this is serious. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=411.06s)]
*  This is not just background chatter. You need to keep vigilant. You need to [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=417.62s)]
*  provide information if you're worried about individuals, support your communities, figure out what they want. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=422.58s)]
*  So it's a, in some ways, it's a message to them. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=428.42s)]
*  The other is it's a message to the impacted communities that some of this is also on your own [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=431.46s)]
*  situational awareness, your own [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=437.76s)]
*  protection of your facility. So you do see synagogues, for example, hiring private [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=440.4s)]
*  guards or just finding ways in which they can make people feel protected in the most sacred of [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=447.68s)]
*  religious sites for them, their synagogue. That's basically [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  what we heard this week was [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=460.32s)]
*  everyone, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=463.76s)]
*  this is serious. This is not just the background stuff anymore. And [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=465.28s)]
*  and hopefully, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=469.76s)]
*  this will help minimize the potential for harm, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  even if it can't minimize the hate [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  language that's out there. So what should universities and campuses do? Because right now it seems that the conversation is primarily about who is, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=478.96s)]
*  whose free speech is being restricted or what are the kind of consequences to this? So [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=487.92s)]
*  what are steps that schools or colleges are taking and should be taking? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=494.4s)]
*  So there's a couple. The first is we got to view this through a public safety lens first, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=498.4s)]
*  So the students are free to have whatever opinions they want. They are not allowed to threaten. They're not allowed to isolate. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=503.04s)]
*  They're not allowed to intimidate and certainly they're not allowed to use violence. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=509.36s)]
*  Period. Those that's not even a that's not even a a university rule. That is in fact [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=513.52s)]
*  rules of the public safety system that we are guided by. And I think what's happened is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=518.72s)]
*  in their sort of twisting of trying to figure out what they want to say. Universities have not taken that seriously seriously enough. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=523.44s)]
*  And I think that that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=529.92s)]
*  behavior would be better in many ways if we began to just view this as we need to we need [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=532.08s)]
*  you know, we need to protect students and their safety and security, whatever their [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=537.44s)]
*  opinion is. The second is just actually kind of related to our [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=543.36s)]
*  first part of this conversation is I think I've been around a long time. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=548.32s)]
*  I think this is the first sort of Israeli conflict or war or violence in the area [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=551.84s)]
*  that has had a very organized [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=558.24s)]
*  Palestinian [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=562.0600000000001s)]
*  support. That you're just seeing it in colleges and universities. I think that's the nature of information. I think it's the nature of [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=564.72s)]
*  this generation and other organizing. I think universities are not used to that. They have to get [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=570.96s)]
*  used to the idea that there are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  multiple opinions about a very complicated area and to create the forums where [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=578.96s)]
*  we can do what we do best, which is try to find solutions and to educate and to provide forums for [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  different ideas. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=591.76s)]
*  And maybe give students a space [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=593.52s)]
*  to be able to do that. I do believe that a lot of these higher political conversations [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=596.4s)]
*  and fighting that's going on in universities and colleges from the funders, from outsiders and others who [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=602.74s)]
*  are unhappy with various statements that university presidents have made and stuff. I think that has increased [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  some of the tensions that we now, I think this can be a long war that we now need to begin to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=617.3000000000001s)]
*  to moderate and provide forums for [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=623.5400000000001s)]
*  students with them understanding under no circumstances [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=627.36s)]
*  is violence or intimidation [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=631.22s)]
*  allowable. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=633.7600000000001s)]
*  I wonder if, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=635.22s)]
*  whether it's the Department of Homeland Security or the FBI, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=636.6600000000001s)]
*  are looking into [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=640.2600000000001s)]
*  the impact that [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=642.4200000000001s)]
*  outside actors may have on our social media ecosystem because [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=644.4200000000001s)]
*  in the run-up to the elections, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=649.5400000000001s)]
*  we saw that there were state actors who [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=652.1s)]
*  profited from dividing Americans. Right. I think that's exactly right. And you can see it. We there's been reporting in the New York Times about [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=656.26s)]
*  Iran's [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=664.26s)]
*  involvement and trying to push a lot of these images around being pro-Hamas and Hezbollah. You have the Russians who [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=665.5400000000001s)]
*  are clearly taking advantage of it through their bot system. Anyone who's online can just tell what's what's going on. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=672.1s)]
*  You know people with with two followers are pushing stuff. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=678.34s)]
*  And then what we're adding to it is one of the most popular social media sites [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=681.7s)]
*  ex formerly Twitter now has no [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=687.38s)]
*  filters to get this stuff out. You know, as anyone who's been in who's in the field of analysis or reporting, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=691.86s)]
*  ex used to be a place where you could have some confidence of what you were looking at. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=699.5400000000001s)]
*  That's no longer true because those filters are gone. So you have outside actors taking advantage of [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=705.46s)]
*  of our of our domestic [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=711.7800000000001s)]
*  divisions and then you have the filtering system no longer existing. And that's why [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=713.86s)]
*  you're getting this sort of it seems like there's no no room for conversation in particular. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=719.0600000000001s)]
*  I mean you raise the politics in the election of this. I mean something that is clearly going on that that that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=724.58s)]
*  that the White House and the Democratic Party are going to have to face is Michigan. If if you're a outside [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=730.26s)]
*  country that wants a GOP candidate or [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=738.34s)]
*  honestly, if you're just looking at the polling right now, Michigan a swing state [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=741.7s)]
*  it is it is sort of ground zero for these fights because as a large Arab and Muslim population and President Biden's [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=746.82s)]
*  polling amongst the Arab and Muslim community has plummeted in ways that no one's ever seen before. Right? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=754.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's just it basically because [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=759.38s)]
*  because Biden is being viewed as too pro-Israel or proof too pro-Netanyahu [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=762.0200000000001s)]
*  that too will have political consequences if in fact Michigan becomes [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=766.6s)]
*  a you know, sort of a a ground for foreign actors as well as domestic ones to take advantage of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=773.24s)]
*  of the of the just horror that's going on in the Middle East. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=780.36s)]
*  You know, I wonder about [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=783.88s)]
*  what the potential for some of this content online whether it's real or it's [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=785.88s)]
*  amped up and fake is I mean, Director Ray, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=791.4799999999999s)]
*  one of the quotes that he had was our most immediate concern is that the violent extremists individuals or small groups [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=794.76s)]
*  Yeah draw inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks against Americans going about their daily lives. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=800.76s)]
*  So, you know, how did you know connect those dots? How do how does the FBI? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=808.04s)]
*  See what is this sort of online chatter in this? Yeah [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=813.2399999999999s)]
*  And turn into action, right? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=818.0400000000001s)]
*  so so one of the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=820.6s)]
*  challenges with this particular conflict from a law enforcement perspective is the language is so heightened [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=822.74s)]
*  in ways that we've never really seen [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=829.32s)]
*  in in recent history and it's essentially the language of annihilation of one population or another it is either [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  the the palestinians and the muslims are expendable or they're all terrorists, right? Or it's that [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=839.5600000000001s)]
*  it's it's the it's the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=845.8000000000001s)]
*  anti-zionism [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=848.58s)]
*  and or [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=850.0400000000001s)]
*  anti-semitism which many jewish americans will view as and view as appropriately as sort of the annihilation [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=852.1800000000001s)]
*  not dissimilar to [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=859.64s)]
*  the holocaust and we have to [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=861.64s)]
*  I think we have to understand that's how it's being perceived by both populations [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  of americans [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=870.5200000000001s)]
*  to maybe be able to [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=871.88s)]
*  To bridge that gap. This is not just I don't like this person both communities view it as annihilation language [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=873.88s)]
*  So turning to the FBI they're seeing this stuff online. Someone randomly says, you know, basically no more jews or whatever [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=879.88s)]
*  But that's just a statement. It's not going to be [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=887.16s)]
*  An action in terms of violence you're allowed to say that in in the united states [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=891.72s)]
*  So so what they do is they continue to monitor these open websites [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=896.52s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that determine whether anyone has a criminal or violent history [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=900.84s)]
*  Someone who may amplify it a bit more target a particular synagogue. That's on the sort of investigatory front [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=906.6s)]
*  That's what the FBI can do. It can't do much [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=912.84s)]
*  Until someone says i'm going after this temple tomorrow or you know something something more organized than I don't like jewish americans or I don't like [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=916.76s)]
*  The faith the second piece of it is now defense and that's what you're also seeing you're seeing governors mayors and [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=924.6800000000001s)]
*  The department of homeland security begin to push [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=932.76s)]
*  Protective assets at synagogues jewish community centers jewish schools where people may feel or be more vulnerable [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=935.94s)]
*  So it's that combination of things but we have to understand the challenge is really [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=943.32s)]
*  Is this language of annihilation of both against? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=948.84s)]
*  uh [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=952.9200000000001s)]
*  judaism and jews and against [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=953.8800000000001s)]
*  uh, or viewing all palestinians as pro-hamas it gives [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=956.7600000000001s)]
*  The the person who might be radicalized a [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=961.4000000000001s)]
*  Justification for the violence, right? They're just simply protecting themselves and that that is why you saw chris ray [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=964.74s)]
*  I think more energized in some ways than i've ever seen him before in that sense of this is really a [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=971.72s)]
*  flashing red light moment and we all need to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=978.12s)]
*  We all need to to watch what we say [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=981.3199999999999s)]
*  and to [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=984.1999999999999s)]
*  Protect ourselves because of this this heightened environment [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=985.56s)]
*  And unfortunately, we've seen actions take place [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=989.4s)]
*  against [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=992.68s)]
*  synagogues jewish individuals as well as [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=993.86s)]
*  muslim individuals in the united states [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=997.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. I mean either it's a it's the it's the attacks or the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=999.4s)]
*  against [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1004.36s)]
*  student groups at universities jewish student groups again universities [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1005.64s)]
*  Concerns about [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1009.24s)]
*  synagogues and the threats specific threats against synagogues and and other areas [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1011.3199999999999s)]
*  um, and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1016.52s)]
*  And then of course the killing by stabbing [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1018.12s)]
*  The sort of most most intimate in a weird way violence, right? I mean he knew the kid [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1021.48s)]
*  Of a of a muslim [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1027.24s)]

*  in chicago [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1030.84s)]
*  So all of it [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1032.6s)]
*  Is is what concerns? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1034.36s)]
*  The fbi at this stage. It's not just talk there are individuals who will act on it and it takes sort of you know [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1037.0s)]
*  Local state federal and the community government and the community [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1043.8799999999999s)]
*  to remain [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1048.1999999999998s)]
*  Vigilant and I should say and it takes leadership from all of these institutions and government [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1049.32s)]
*  to not amplify that talk of annihilation, right? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1055.32s)]
*  I mean in other words we that language is also something that triggers people who are looking for [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1059.08s)]
*  justification for their hate [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2RUa7Nol-w&t=1065.56s)]
