# British-Palestinian Surgeon on Treating the Wounded in Gaza | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I)
*  The problem is the sheer size of the calamity that has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=0.0s)]
*  been fallen in Gaza, 6,500 wounded in six days in a place [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=4.92s)]
*  where the total bed capacity is 2,500. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=10.56s)]
*  This has completely overwhelmed the health system, which [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=14.24s)]
*  was already on its knees at the end of 15 years of siege. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=17.68s)]
*  And the health system is unable to cope. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=21.72s)]
*  We are down on consumables, on the very material [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=26.28s)]
*  that you need to be able to treat patients, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=30.0s)]
*  whether they're dressings or anesthetic equipment [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=32.52s)]
*  or disposable. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=36.36s)]
*  And the capacity, the operating room capacity [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=38.4s)]
*  of most hospitals in Gaza is unable to cope [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=42.6s)]
*  with the sheer number of patients who [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=45.96s)]
*  need to be taken to the operating rooms [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=47.72s)]
*  and the patients who now are critically ill and need [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  intensive care unit. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=54.04s)]
*  Dr. Hassan, can you tell me what is the effect, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=56.879999999999995s)]
*  and are you feeling it yet, of the blockade [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=60.2s)]
*  as the Israeli defense minister announced a few days ago, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=63.08s)]
*  as I was just talking to a senior government advisor [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=65.8s)]
*  about the food, the fuel, the water? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=68.44s)]
*  Do you have enough water? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=72.16s)]
*  Do people have food? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=73.56s)]
*  Is it going to run out? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=75.28s)]
*  So the thing that you notice most [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=78.56s)]
*  when you're in the hospital is the absence [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=81.08s)]
*  of basic medical needs, equipment [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=83.12s)]
*  that you need to be able to treat the patient. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=87.36s)]
*  Also, all of the hospitals now are completely [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=90.28s)]
*  dependent on generators for electricity. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=92.36s)]
*  And diesel is one of those things that are now [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=95.12s)]
*  not coming in as a result of this total blockade. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=97.32s)]
*  You see these water tanks that are being delivered to homes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=101.92s)]
*  and to hospitals all around the clock, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=108.08s)]
*  even though there is continuous bombing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=111.48s)]
*  And food at the moment is not short, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=114.08s)]
*  but there is over 250,000 people displaced, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=116.8s)]
*  a lot of them thousands living in the compound of Al-Shifa [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=121.2s)]
*  Hospital, Gaza's main hospital, or with relatives. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=126.44s)]
*  And so these people who've left their homes [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=131.0s)]
*  have lost their ability to fend for themselves [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=133.36s)]
*  and feed themselves. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=136.28s)]
*  And so what we're looking at is a catastrophe, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=138.72s)]
*  a man-made catastrophe that's almost like a perfect storm. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=143.72s)]
*  People are displaced. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=150.48s)]
*  Their homes are destroyed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=151.8s)]
*  A crippled health system as a result of the siege [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=154.8s)]
*  and numbers beyond the capacity of the health system [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=158.72s)]
*  to deal with. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=162.88s)]
*  Dr. Hassan, can I ask you something? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=165.16s)]
*  You came in somehow into Gaza from the UK, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=167.52s)]
*  I'm assuming from the Egyptian side, the Rafa border. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=171.52s)]
*  And you know Israel has told people to leave, just leave. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=175.68s)]
*  Seek shelter, leave. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=180.88s)]
*  Is there two-way traffic? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=183.04s)]
*  Are people able to leave? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=185.16s)]
*  You were able to come in. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  So I was part of the last group of people [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=190.64s)]
*  that kind of got in on Monday morning, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=193.2s)]
*  early hours of Monday morning. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=195.76s)]
*  And I think soon after, the Israeli Air Force [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=197.44s)]
*  bombed the area around Rafa and forced it shut. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=199.88s)]
*  There hasn't been anybody in, and certainly no one [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=204.44s)]
*  has been out since then. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=207.2s)]
*  I think the Rafa crossing has been shut since then. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=208.76s)]
*  And tell me, what motivated you to go there? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=213.92s)]
*  And have you done this before in other war zones? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=217.72s)]
*  So I've been to Gaza's wars in the 2009 attack on Gaza, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=220.12s)]
*  2012 and 2014 and 2021. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=227.72s)]
*  And I've worked in Mosul, I've worked in Yemen, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=232.08s)]
*  I've worked in Damascus. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=235.96s)]
*  I am a plastic and reconstructive surgeon. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  I have, over the years, developed an expertise [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=241.56s)]
*  in war surgery. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=247.88000000000002s)]
*  And as a Palestinian, I am driven to continuously come back [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=251.8s)]
*  and help my people here who are under continuous attack. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=259.8s)]
*  And as someone who's worked in the health system in Gaza, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=264.72s)]
*  I'm acutely aware of the shortfall [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=267.44s)]
*  in terms of equipment and expertise and material [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=272.6s)]
*  that exist in the system. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=276.64s)]
*  And can you tell me what kind of injuries you're seeing most of? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=279.12s)]
*  I know you've talked about burns and not even having [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=284.15999999999997s)]
*  the right disinfectant to rub down burns before treatment. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=286.44s)]
*  But what other injuries are you treating? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=291.32s)]
*  So the overwhelming majority of the wounded [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=295.2s)]
*  are coming from the rubble of their own home. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=299.32s)]
*  And this means that between 30% and 40% of the wounded [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=302.36s)]
*  are children. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=305.68s)]
*  And they're injured by the blast, shrapnel, masonry [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=307.12s)]
*  that flies in and damages their bodies, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=312.52s)]
*  or they're crushed under the rubble of their own home. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=317.12s)]
*  So all of these injuries are extremely contaminated [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=321.72s)]
*  and require surgeries and repeated surgeries. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=326.32s)]
*  And the devastating thing is with children, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=329.52s)]
*  this is a lifetime worth of reconstructive surgery. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=334.76s)]
*  As that body, that scarred body tries to grow in the future, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  these kids will need surgery after surgery. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8p72YdjU3I&t=343.64s)]
