*  Tarek Bocconi, thank you so much [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=25.8s)]
*  for speaking with us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=27.2s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  I just want to make it crystal [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  clear that you are an historian. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  You are not a spokesman for [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=33.6s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=34.8s)]
*  You are not an apologist for [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=35.8s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=37.2s)]
*  You are an historian who has [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=37.8s)]
*  studied the movement for many [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=39.2s)]
*  years. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=40.8s)]
*  So with that being said, give us [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=41.4s)]
*  the short course on how Hamas [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  developed. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=47.4s)]
*  What's the origin story? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=48.2s)]
*  Well, Hamas really is a chapter [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=50.2s)]
*  of the Muslim Brotherhood, which [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=52.0s)]
*  is a movement that's present in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=53.2s)]
*  different situations throughout [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=55.2s)]
*  the Middle East that is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=56.4s)]
*  committed to what it calls the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=57.8s)]
*  Islamization of society. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  So really, it started as a [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=60.599999999999994s)]
*  social network that looks at [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=62.4s)]
*  providing educational [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=65.2s)]
*  facilities, health care, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=67.0s)]
*  charitable work, training, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  vocational centers, and it [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=70.39999999999999s)]
*  really embeds itself in society [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=72.6s)]
*  as a movement that's committed [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=74.4s)]
*  to helping Palestinians live a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=76.4s)]
*  virtuous Islamic life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=78.8s)]
*  Now, in 1987, at the beginning [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=80.6s)]
*  of the first Palestinian [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=84.2s)]
*  Intifada, when Palestinians [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=85.4s)]
*  rose en masse against Israel's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=87.2s)]
*  occupation, that Islamic party, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=90.4s)]
*  which was present in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=93.2s)]
*  Palestinian territories, spun [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=94.4s)]
*  off into what came to be known [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=97.4s)]
*  as Hamas. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=99.4s)]
*  Hamas is the Islamic resistance [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=100.2s)]
*  party. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  It's essentially a national [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=103.2s)]
*  party committed specifically to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=104.4s)]
*  the liberation of Palestine [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=106.4s)]
*  through the use of armed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=108.2s)]
*  struggle. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=109.4s)]
*  It's believed that the only way [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  that Israel can be compelled to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=112.2s)]
*  end its occupation of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=114.2s)]
*  Palestinian people is through [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=116.0s)]
*  resistance and armed force. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  Was there a pivotal moment when [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  Hamas created its own movement, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=121.4s)]
*  as it were, sort of apart from [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  others that were already there? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=127.4s)]
*  Was there like a pivotal event? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=129.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was the beginning of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=131.4s)]
*  the first Intifada. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=132.8s)]
*  So Hamas's parents, let's say, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=133.8s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood umbrella [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  from which it emerged, believed [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=138.4s)]
*  in one thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  It believed that in order to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=141.0s)]
*  achieve liberation, Palestinians [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=142.4s)]
*  need to have a virtuous society. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=144.2s)]
*  So it focused on the social [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=145.6s)]
*  elements rather than on the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=147.0s)]
*  political or military element of [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=149.39999999999998s)]
*  resisting the occupation. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=151.2s)]
*  At the beginning of the first [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=153.2s)]
*  Intifada, we saw Palestinians [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=154.39999999999998s)]
*  engage in popular struggle [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=156.6s)]
*  throughout Palestine against [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  Israeli occupying forces, and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=160.2s)]
*  Israel responded with force. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  Famously, at the time, it's [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=165.6s)]
*  Haq Ra'bin called on the Israeli [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  army to break the bones of all [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  the protesters. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  And here we're talking about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=171.2s)]
*  mostly children going out to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=172.7s)]
*  fight with rocks against tanks. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=174.89999999999998s)]
*  That's sort of the famous thing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  Rock throwing, yeah. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  Right. So Hamas, at the time, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=179.1s)]
*  saw this as a very critical [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  escalation and decided actually [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=183.89999999999998s)]
*  that its long-term project of [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  liberation through Islamization [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=187.6s)]
*  had to be switched on its head. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=189.0s)]
*  So rather than Islamize before [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=190.6s)]
*  liberation, the splinter group [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=193.5s)]
*  decided that actually the way [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=195.89999999999998s)]
*  now is to engage in armed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  resistance against the Israeli [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=199.1s)]
*  occupation forces as a mode of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=200.5s)]
*  liberating Palestine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=203.6s)]
*  And I understand that from your [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=205.1s)]
*  writings that you think calling [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=206.3s)]
*  Hamas a terrorist group kind of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=207.6s)]
*  misrepresents reality. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=208.8s)]
*  The reason why it's manipulative [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=210.2s)]
*  to use that term is because it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=212.5s)]
*  misses that nuance and it [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=215.6s)]
*  decontextualizes Hamas. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=217.4s)]
*  So it suggests that Hamas is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=219.0s)]
*  engaging in armed resistance or [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=220.6s)]
*  violence for the sake of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=222.8s)]
*  violence. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=224.1s)]
*  It misses the point that Hamas [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=225.0s)]
*  is engaged in armed resistance [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=226.5s)]
*  against a colonial force, a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=228.5s)]
*  force that's maintaining an [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=230.6s)]
*  occupation that's illegal under [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=231.6s)]
*  international law. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=233.1s)]
*  When Western policymakers engage [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=234.4s)]
*  with Hamas only as a terrorist [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=236.6s)]
*  organization, they're suggesting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=238.4s)]
*  that that can be dealt with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=240.2s)]
*  militarily. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=241.3s)]
*  They're abdicating on their [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=242.0s)]
*  responsibility of dealing with [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=243.7s)]
*  the question of Palestine [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=245.0s)]
*  politically. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=246.4s)]
*  A key point of difference, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=247.3s)]
*  though, between Hamas and the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=248.4s)]
*  PLO is that the PLO has [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=249.4s)]
*  recognized the right of Israel [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=251.2s)]
*  to exist and Hamas never has. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=253.3s)]
*  And the whole point of Hamas [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=256.4s)]
*  is charter, where Hamas makes [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=258.4s)]
*  clear its refusal to recognize [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=260.29999999999995s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=262.09999999999997s)]
*  And also the text has been [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=263.5s)]
*  replete with anti-Semitic [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=264.59999999999997s)]
*  references built on stereotypes [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=265.79999999999995s)]
*  about sort of the Jewish people. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=267.7s)]
*  I mean, how are we to look at [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=269.0s)]
*  that? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean, obviously the way that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=271.0s)]
*  a number of analysts look at [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=274.5s)]
*  that is that this is, A, it is [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=275.79999999999995s)]
*  bloodlust and, B, that it's kind [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=278.7s)]
*  of a fantasy that Israel will be [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=281.09999999999997s)]
*  kind of wiped off the face of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  the earth. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  And so I just like to hear your [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=286.5s)]
*  take on that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=288.7s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two points that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=289.7s)]
*  you're raising here, both of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=291.0s)]
*  them very important. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=292.1s)]
*  So the first in terms of the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=292.9s)]
*  PLO's recognition of the state [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=294.8s)]
*  of Israel, we have to remember [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=296.1s)]
*  that before the PLO recognized [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=297.3s)]
*  the state of Israel, it too [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=298.8s)]
*  engaged in armed resistance. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=300.4s)]
*  And it too was deemed to be a [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=302.6s)]
*  terrorist organization by the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=304.5s)]
*  U.S. and other members of the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=305.8s)]
*  international community. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=307.6s)]
*  And the demand on it was that it [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=308.6s)]
*  would renounce armed resistance [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=310.2s)]
*  and recognize the state of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=311.8s)]
*  Israel in order to establish [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=312.8s)]
*  the state of Palestine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=314.7s)]
*  Fast forward three decades and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=316.1s)]
*  Palestinians don't have a state. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  Palestinians have more entrenched [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  occupation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=321.90000000000003s)]
*  We have an Israeli regime that [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=322.90000000000003s)]
*  is more fascist than it's ever [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  been in history that's expanding [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  its colonial violence against [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=329.1s)]
*  Palestinians in the West Bank, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=330.70000000000005s)]
*  in Jerusalem and Palestinian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=332.1s)]
*  citizens, as well as tightening [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=333.70000000000005s)]
*  the blockade. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  So the idea that the recognition [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=336.1s)]
*  of Israel has would pave the way [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=337.70000000000005s)]
*  for Palestinian rights has [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  completely been undermined by [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=341.8s)]
*  the way the international [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=343.5s)]
*  community has refused to hold [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=344.4s)]
*  Israel accountable. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=346.29999999999995s)]
*  And so the second point then is [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=347.7s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  Hamas sees the PLO's experience. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=350.5s)]
*  It understands that the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=353.0s)]
*  recognition of Israel is not [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=354.2s)]
*  going to lead to Palestinian [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  rights because we have that [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=356.7s)]
*  history. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=357.9s)]
*  We see that track record. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=358.4s)]
*  And so the movement rather [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=360.2s)]
*  believes that the best way to [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  secure Palestinian liberation [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=364.5s)]
*  is through armed resistance. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=366.7s)]
*  And at the negotiating table, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=368.4s)]
*  which Hamas does not dismiss, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=370.4s)]
*  it openly talks about [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=371.9s)]
*  possibly negotiating, but that [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=374.0s)]
*  has to come from a position of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=375.9s)]
*  force. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  I just want to say one point [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=377.8s)]
*  about Hamas's anti-Semitism. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=379.09999999999997s)]
*  Hamas's charter was anti-Semitic. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=380.9s)]
*  The movement engaged in awful [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=383.9s)]
*  tropes around the Jewish people, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=385.7s)]
*  including dealing with texts [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=388.2s)]
*  like the elders of Zion and in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=390.0s)]
*  dealing with stereotypical tropes [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=392.8s)]
*  around the Jewish people [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=394.5s)]
*  controlling the media and [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=395.4s)]
*  controlling world powers. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=396.7s)]
*  Now the movement since its early [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  inception has evolved quite [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=401.6s)]
*  significantly. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=403.8s)]
*  And in 2017, it issued a new [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=404.6s)]
*  document which it thought to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=407.1s)]
*  replace its original charter. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=409.40000000000003s)]
*  And in that document, it openly [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=410.90000000000003s)]
*  distinguishes between Jews and [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  Zionists and articulates that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=415.20000000000005s)]
*  its project of liberation is [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=417.6s)]
*  against Zionist colonialism in [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=419.40000000000003s)]
*  Palestine, not against Jews as [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=421.20000000000005s)]
*  a religion or people. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  What I'm asking you, though, is [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  it still the vision of Hamas [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=425.90000000000003s)]
*  that Israel should be [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=427.5s)]
*  eliminated? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=428.8s)]
*  No way. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=429.8s)]
*  Not what is their vision of [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=430.3s)]
*  what should occur? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=433.7s)]
*  The way that Hamas talks about [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=434.8s)]
*  its vision, and I should say [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  that this is not necessarily [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=437.8s)]
*  the vision that is shared by [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=439.5s)]
*  many Palestinians. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=441.2s)]
*  Hamas's ideological vision is [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=442.2s)]
*  that it would liberate Palestine. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  What that means is that it [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=446.6s)]
*  would create a state as it [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=448.0s)]
*  defines it that is grounded in [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=449.8s)]
*  Islam and that has Islam as its [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=452.6s)]
*  founding principles under which [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  Jews, Christians, and Palestinians [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=456.3s)]
*  would live in equality. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=458.6s)]
*  That's how Hamas defines its [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  political project. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=462.0s)]
*  Now, what that means in practice [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=462.9s)]
*  is unclear. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  And it doesn't necessarily mean [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=467.3s)]
*  that the destruction of the [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=470.09999999999997s)]
*  state of Israel in the way that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=472.09999999999997s)]
*  that phrase is manipulated to [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=473.5s)]
*  mean, which is throwing Israeli [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=475.4s)]
*  Jews into the sea, that's not [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=476.59999999999997s)]
*  necessarily a part of their [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=478.9s)]
*  political project. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=480.09999999999997s)]
*  And sure, there are members in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=480.9s)]
*  Hamas that would believe that [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=482.2s)]
*  they should be doing that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=484.09999999999997s)]
*  But the political project, as it [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  defines it, is the creation of a [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=487.4s)]
*  state in Palestine in which all [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=489.0s)]
*  three religions can live and it [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=490.9s)]
*  would be a state that's grounded [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=492.8s)]
*  in Islam. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=494.0s)]
*  Why hasn't Hamas had elections [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=494.8s)]
*  since the 17 years so that they [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=496.8s)]
*  could demonstrate that they have [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=498.3s)]
*  a mandate for their vision for [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=499.3s)]
*  Palestine? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=501.5s)]
*  You know, why not? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=502.4s)]
*  I mean, if they were unable to, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=503.2s)]
*  if they had the means to develop [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=504.2s)]
*  this complex series of tunnels, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=505.9s)]
*  you know, underneath, you know, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=507.6s)]
*  the strip which was allowed them [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=509.1s)]
*  to mount these attacks, then why [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=510.5s)]
*  have they not been able to [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=512.0s)]
*  institute other principles of [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=513.4s)]
*  governance, which would [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=514.9s)]
*  demonstrate that they have a [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=515.7s)]
*  mandate? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=516.6s)]
*  That's a really good question. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=517.1s)]
*  So in the last set of elections [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=518.9s)]
*  that happened in the Palestinian [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=520.6999999999999s)]
*  territories, Hamas democratically [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=521.9s)]
*  won the elections. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=524.0s)]
*  So it was chosen by the Palestinians [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=525.3s)]
*  in 2006. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=527.6s)]
*  under occupation in 2006 to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=528.5s)]
*  come into a system of governments. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=531.5s)]
*  And those elections were deemed [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=533.6s)]
*  fair by international observers. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=535.0s)]
*  So when we're talking about the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=537.3s)]
*  next round of elections, we're [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=539.0s)]
*  talking about two things. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=541.1s)]
*  First of all, will the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=542.6s)]
*  international community, including [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=543.6s)]
*  the U.S., accept if Hamas emerges [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=545.0s)]
*  as a democratic victor? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  Because right now in 2021, the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=548.6999999999999s)]
*  last poll showed us that it will [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=551.8s)]
*  win. And the second question is [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=553.3s)]
*  that to have democratic elections, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=555.4s)]
*  it has to be in Palestine, which [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=558.5s)]
*  means including the West Bank [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=560.3s)]
*  and the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=562.3s)]
*  Right now Israel has, and this is [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=563.3s)]
*  the Israeli Prime Minister, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=565.4s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking, not [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=566.5s)]
*  me, has openly endorsed a policy [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=568.0s)]
*  of separating the Gaza Strip from [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=571.3s)]
*  Hamas, from the West Bank and [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=573.5s)]
*  playing divide and rule. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=576.0s)]
*  So all the efforts to engage in a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=577.5s)]
*  unity government or to engage in [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  democratic elections are actively [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=581.4s)]
*  undermined by Israeli authorities. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=583.0999999999999s)]
*  You have a piece in the New York [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=585.8s)]
*  Review of Books that I actually I [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=587.0s)]
*  found fascinating. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=588.5999999999999s)]
*  You say that there's something of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=590.5999999999999s)]
*  a symbiotic relationship between [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=592.1999999999999s)]
*  the Netanyahu government and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=594.3s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=595.6999999999999s)]
*  In fact, one of the points that [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=597.5s)]
*  you made is that the very [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=598.9s)]
*  isolation that the Netanyahu [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=600.0999999999999s)]
*  government has instituted and [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=604.5s)]
*  maintained of the Gaza Strip [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=607.1s)]
*  actually allowed Gaza to kind of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  develop its resistance movement [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=611.6s)]
*  more thoroughly. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=614.0s)]
*  So could you just say a little [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=616.2s)]
*  bit more about that as briefly as [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=617.2s)]
*  you can? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=619.3000000000001s)]
*  I think it's a really important [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=620.1s)]
*  question. So over the course of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=621.2s)]
*  the past 16 years, Israel's [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=622.4s)]
*  political establishment and [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=624.4s)]
*  certainly their military [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=625.7s)]
*  establishment believe that they [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=627.2s)]
*  can contain Hamas in the Gaza [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=628.3000000000001s)]
*  Strip. What that means is that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=630.4s)]
*  they believe they can tolerate [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=632.2s)]
*  and even enable Hamas to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=634.4s)]
*  operate as a governing authority [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=636.9s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip, thereby [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=638.6s)]
*  taking responsibility for 2.3 [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=640.4s)]
*  million Palestinians in Gaza, and [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=642.3s)]
*  that would allow Israel to [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=644.4s)]
*  deflect its responsibility as [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=647.0s)]
*  the occupying force of those [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=648.6999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians. So by placing [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=650.1s)]
*  Hamas or by allowing Hamas to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=651.9s)]
*  continue to exist as a governing [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=654.3s)]
*  entity in the Gaza Strip, Israel [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=656.0s)]
*  effectively severed Gaza from the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=658.1s)]
*  rest of historic Palestine and [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=659.9s)]
*  in so doing essentially got rid [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=661.4s)]
*  of 2 million Palestinians from [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=664.5s)]
*  under its immediate control. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=667.1s)]
*  So in other ways, demographically [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=668.9s)]
*  engineered itself as a Jewish [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=670.9s)]
*  majority state. Now to maintain [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=672.5s)]
*  Hamas as a governing authority, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=674.6s)]
*  Israel relied on something the [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=676.9s)]
*  military establishment called [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=678.3s)]
*  mowing the lawn, which meant [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=679.6s)]
*  that every few years it would [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=681.3s)]
*  carry out a military assault on [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=683.5s)]
*  the Gaza Strip to try to [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=685.0s)]
*  undermine Hamas's military [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=686.1s)]
*  capabilities and in exchange it [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=687.5s)]
*  would expect Hamas to continue [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=690.3s)]
*  to exist in Gaza, rein in [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=692.9s)]
*  resistance from Gaza and acquiesce [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  to remaining under blockade. Now [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=697.6s)]
*  during that time, it's now clear [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=700.8s)]
*  that Hamas has been using its [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=702.6s)]
*  its role as a governing entity [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=706.6999999999999s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip to develop a [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=708.4s)]
*  military arsenal and to shift [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=709.6999999999999s)]
*  back that dynamic. So rather [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=711.9s)]
*  than accepting to continue to [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=713.6999999999999s)]
*  live silently under blockade, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=715.9s)]
*  they were preparing to turn the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=717.4s)]
*  tables at Israel and reassert [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=718.6999999999999s)]
*  the Palestinian project. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=721.0999999999999s)]
*  One of the things that we hear [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=725.6999999999999s)]
*  from Israeli leaders at this [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=727.8s)]
*  juncture is that they have no [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=730.9s)]
*  choice in the way they are [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=732.6999999999999s)]
*  pursuing their project now, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  particularly in the wake of this [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=737.3s)]
*  gruesome attack. Are you saying [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=738.6999999999999s)]
*  that Hamas feels the same? That [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=741.0999999999999s)]
*  they have no choice? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=742.9s)]
*  Well, no, I actually completely [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=744.5s)]
*  disagree with that take from the [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=746.5999999999999s)]
*  Israeli political establishment. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=748.3s)]
*  What do you disagree with that [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=749.6s)]
*  take from Hamas? Because one of [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=750.6s)]
*  the arguments here is that the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=752.1s)]
*  capabilities that they [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=754.0s)]
*  demonstrated in building up this [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=755.1s)]
*  military arsenal and resistance, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  at least some of that could have [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=759.2s)]
*  been directed toward improving [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=760.5s)]
*  the lives of the people living [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=761.9s)]
*  in Gaza, and they chose not to [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=763.9s)]
*  do that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=765.3000000000001s)]
*  So let me ask you this. What [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=766.0s)]
*  would improving the lives of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=767.2s)]
*  Palestinians in Gaza look like? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=768.3000000000001s)]
*  If Hamas invested in healthcare [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=769.7s)]
*  and invested in education and [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=771.7s)]
*  invested in infrastructure and [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=773.5s)]
*  the Palestinians in Gaza are [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=775.9s)]
*  enjoying a better quality of [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=777.6s)]
*  life while Israel continued to [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=779.0s)]
*  maintain a hermetic blockade, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=780.7s)]
*  which means that food, medicine, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=782.7s)]
*  fuel, electricity is still [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=785.7s)]
*  controlled by Israel. The [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=787.5s)]

*  Israel responded to that with [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=851.4s)]
*  sniper fires. Over the course [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=852.9s)]

*  So popular resistance didn't [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=866.3s)]

*  the fact of the matter is that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=893.8s)]
*  has been a continuous tactic of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=894.8s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=897.0999999999999s)]
*  The suicide bombers were hugely [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=898.8s)]

*  Palestinians more broadly. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=902.0s)]
*  And by the way, Hamas wasn't the [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=903.0999999999999s)]
*  only party that engaged in [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=904.3s)]
*  suicide bombing. So did FATAH, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=905.5999999999999s)]
*  which is now sitting in the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=907.3s)]
*  Palestinian Authority in the West [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=908.3s)]

*  contentious precisely because [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  they were targeting civilians [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  and they were indiscriminate. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=915.0999999999999s)]
*  So obviously they were war [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=916.1999999999999s)]
*  crimes. But the movement, as did [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=917.6999999999999s)]

*  in a manner that, you know, they [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=926.0s)]
*  thought about the moral [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwckjA_DJW0&t=928.7s)]
