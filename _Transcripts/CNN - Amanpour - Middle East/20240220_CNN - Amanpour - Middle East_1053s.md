# Haaretz’s Aluf Benn: Netanyahu Has Spent Career Derailing a Palestinian State | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [February 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68)
*  Next, we turn to the horrors of the war in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinian health authorities say more than 29,000 Gazans [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=3.4s)]
*  have now been killed, while the United States pivots at the UN [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=7.0s)]
*  proposing a resolution for a temporary ceasefire, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=10.4s)]
*  and warning Israel not to send ground troops [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=13.8s)]
*  into an offensive in Ra'far, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=16.4s)]
*  where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=18.2s)]
*  Aluf Ben is the editor-in-chief at Haaretz. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=21.8s)]
*  His latest essay for Foreign Affairs is called [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=24.8s)]
*  Israel's Self-Destruction, Netanyahu, the Palestinians, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=27.6s)]
*  and the Price of Neglect, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  and he's joining Walter Isaacson to talk about it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=33.2s)]
*  Thank you, Christiane and Aluf Ben. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=39.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  President Biden has been talking to Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=42.6s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron, the president of France. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=46.8s)]
*  They both urged him not to go into Ra'far so hard. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu posted on X [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=53.8s)]
*  a pretty defiant statement in reaction to that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=56.6s)]
*  It says, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=60.0s)]
*  We will continue to fight until complete victory [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=61.0s)]
*  with all of our strength on every front, everywhere, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=64.2s)]
*  until we restore security and peace. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=68.0s)]
*  Do you think that Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=71.4s)]
*  is right to be rebuffing President Macron and President Biden? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=74.4s)]
*  No, I think he's wrong. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=80.4s)]
*  I think that President Biden is actually offering Israel [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=82.2s)]
*  a great promise, a very promising peace plan that, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=88.2s)]
*  according to the reports that we've read [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=92.4s)]
*  at the Washington Post and other sources, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=94.8s)]
*  he's working with several Arab leaders [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=98.6s)]
*  on a very comprehensive plan for the day after the Gaza war [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=101.0s)]
*  with working towards the establishment of a Palestinian state, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=105.4s)]
*  towards implementing the two-state solution, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=109.6s)]
*  wider normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=112.0s)]
*  and perhaps other Arab states, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=115.8s)]
*  and of course finding a mechanism for better security [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  for Israel and its neighbors along the borders, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=122.19999999999999s)]
*  both in Gaza and in the north, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=124.8s)]
*  where there is a lower intensity conflict with Hezbollah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=126.6s)]
*  All that sounds good, but ever since the Oslo Accords, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=131.0s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, and even before the Oslo Accords, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=134.4s)]
*  has been against a Palestinian state in response to this plan, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=137.6s)]
*  he wrote, Israel outright rejects international dictates [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=142.8s)]
*  regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=147.0s)]
*  How can we get from here to there [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=151.6s)]
*  if he's not even going to be open to the question [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=153.8s)]
*  of a Palestinian state? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=157.4s)]
*  Well, that's a very, that's the toughest question of all. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=159.6s)]
*  Clearly, Netanyahu has spent his entire career [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=162.4s)]
*  trying to derail the Palestinian National Movement. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=167.2s)]
*  And especially since returning to power in 2009, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=170.0s)]
*  when he began by saying that he would somehow conditionally [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=173.6s)]
*  agree to a Palestinian state, he changed his mind. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  And his last coalition, the current one, very right-wing, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=181.2s)]
*  the most right-wing coalition in Israel's history, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  even declared that nobody besides the Jewish people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=189.0s)]
*  has any rights in the entire space [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=193.0s)]
*  between the river and the sea. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=196.4s)]
*  Clearly, the Palestinians, time and again, have shown [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=199.6s)]
*  that they're not willing to forego their aspirations, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=202.6s)]
*  their dreams, their fights against Israel in the case of Hamas. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=206.6s)]
*  And time and again, this idea that we could simply ignore [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=211.4s)]
*  the problem came back to haunt Israel. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=215.6s)]
*  But for 15 years, Netanyahu has told the story [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=218.6s)]
*  that Israel could prosper without peace, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=221.8s)]
*  could reach out to the wider Arab world without peace. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=224.4s)]
*  And to some extent, aided by the Arab Spring that, you know, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=227.8s)]
*  dismantled and disrupted the Arab world, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=232.4s)]
*  Israel was able to enjoy that quiet security, prosperity, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=236.6s)]
*  while most of the time ignoring the Palestinians. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=242.6s)]
*  But after October 7, clearly, this is no longer the case. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=245.6s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu sticks to a coalition that is very right-wing, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=249.8s)]
*  and suffering from a very low popularity [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=254.6s)]
*  due to the failures of October 7 and what got Israel into this war. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=257.2s)]
*  So he's trying to rebuild his campaign by saying that [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  he would be the only one who could oppose [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  the international dictation towards the Palestinian state. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  And clearly, President Biden, too, has his own political worries [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  before presidential election, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=274.59999999999997s)]
*  regard, you know, vis-à-vis the progressives in his own party [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  that are less pro-Israel than their parents and grandparents, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=280.8s)]
*  or the Biden generation, if you want, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=285.6s)]
*  if you're in the Democratic Party, if you want. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=287.0s)]
*  So this fight serves them both politically, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=289.6s)]
*  but it doesn't get us out of the war, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=293.6s)]
*  and it doesn't get us towards a better coexistence [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=295.6s)]
*  or peaceful solution in the future. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=297.8s)]
*  And that's a problem. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=299.40000000000003s)]
*  The more immediate problem is the hostages [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=301.0s)]
*  and the continuation of this war. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=304.0s)]
*  CIA Director William Burns in the United States [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=306.0s)]
*  has been part of a process with a lot of nations. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=309.2s)]
*  They were meeting in Cairo to try to have what I think the president called [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=311.8s)]
*  a sustained period of calm for at least six weeks [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=317.8s)]
*  and to have a hostage exchange. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=321.8s)]
*  Now Prime Minister Netanyahu is not even sending negotiators [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=324.2s)]
*  to be part of that process in Cairo. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=329.0s)]
*  Will he face domestic pressure [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=331.8s)]
*  for not being able to release the hostages? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=334.8s)]
*  Netanyahu has been able, you know, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=337.4s)]
*  regretfully, he's been able to paint this, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=341.2s)]
*  the call to release the hostages, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  or to free the hostages, bring them back home [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=347.59999999999997s)]
*  in return for the release of some Palestinian prisoners [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=350.2s)]
*  into a political fight. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=356.0s)]
*  So he colored it as if the opposition that is against him [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=357.59999999999997s)]
*  and against his political base is supporting the hostage deal [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=361.2s)]
*  while he's standing up to Hamas and to the rest of the world. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=366.0s)]
*  While these hostages are dying there [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=369.4s)]
*  and those who are alive are suffering the worst atrocities you can think of. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=372.2s)]
*  But clearly there is not enough pressure on Netanyahu [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=377.2s)]
*  to conclude this deal. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=380.2s)]
*  He's still suffering from criticism in his base [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=383.6s)]
*  towards a deal he signed with Hamas in 2011 [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=387.4s)]
*  to release one Israeli prisoner of war, Gilad Shalit, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=391.0s)]
*  in return for over a thousand Palestinians, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=394.0s)]
*  including Yehia Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  the organizer of the October 7 massacre. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  And so Netanyahu is trying to compensate that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=404.8s)]
*  Let me push back on you on that. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=407.6s)]
*  Shouldn't he be criticized for that deal? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=409.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's easy to say that, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=413.40000000000003s)]
*  you know, looking back, it was a mistake to release Sinwar. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  It was not even so important to the Israelis at the time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=419.2s)]
*  The Israelis at the time resisted the release of other terrorists, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=422.2s)]
*  not Sinwar. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=426.8s)]
*  He was seen as a smaller-time terrorist [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=428.2s)]
*  because he killed only Palestinians and not Jews. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=431.2s)]
*  But look, the circumstances were different. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=434.2s)]
*  There was a lot of pressure to release Shalit. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=439.0s)]
*  And frankly, if the country was better prepared for war, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  the border was better protected. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=445.8s)]
*  And Netanyahu, rather than tear the country apart [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=447.8s)]
*  with what he called legal reform, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=450.4s)]
*  which was a kind of autocratic coup [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=453.4s)]
*  through dismantling the independence of the Supreme Court [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=456.2s)]
*  and other civil liberties and democratic freedoms in Israel, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=459.4s)]
*  it would have been in a better shape. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  This was not a given that if you release someone from prison, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  they come back to fight you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=469.0s)]
*  You just published a piece in Foreign Affairs [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=470.4s)]
*  called Israel's Self-Destruction, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=473.4s)]
*  in which you say that Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=476.4s)]
*  paved the way for what happened on October 7. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=480.0s)]
*  Explain. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=483.6s)]
*  Well, I think the major thing was the ignorance of Palestinians [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=486.2s)]
*  and the argument that Israel could live and prosper [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=492.2s)]
*  while not looking at the Palestinians or treating them [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=495.6s)]
*  as bad as possible without paying any price. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=499.2s)]
*  Or with occasional outbursts of terrorist attacks [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=503.4s)]
*  or occasional rocket fire from Gaza, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=506.6s)]
*  that Israel could live with and develop defensive systems [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=509.4s)]
*  to protect against. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=513.8s)]
*  This obviously was not the case, as we see. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=516.6s)]
*  But even more so in the past year, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=519.6s)]
*  since returning to power a year ago, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=521.8s)]
*  Netanyahu did everything to split Israeli society [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=524.8s)]
*  through his judicial coup, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=528.0s)]
*  ignoring time and again warnings from his own defense minister, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=530.4s)]
*  from the heads of intelligence, of security service, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=536.0s)]
*  from senior military personnel, acting and reservists, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=540.4s)]
*  telling him that this internal split is a temptation [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=546.0s)]
*  for Israel's enemies to hit, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=550.0s)]
*  and that the risk of war is almost imminent. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=552.0s)]
*  True, they were not focused on Hamas. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=556.4s)]
*  They were focused on stronger enemies like Iran, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=559.8s)]
*  like Hezbollah, like other Iranian proxies in the region. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=562.2s)]
*  But still, Netanyahu ignored it. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=565.2s)]
*  He did not see any risk. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  He also only saw political risk in these warnings. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=569.6s)]
*  He never once said, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=573.0s)]
*  okay, let's check the security along the borders. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  Are we safe? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=577.6s)]
*  He tried to fire the defense minister [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=579.0s)]
*  after he issued his warning, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=581.4000000000001s)]
*  and he ignored the military intelligence chiefs, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=583.4000000000001s)]
*  whom he saw as supporting his opponents, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  many of whom were former generals and pilots and so on, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=590.2s)]
*  and people who were very proud of the military service. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=594.4s)]
*  And Netanyahu throughout his career [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=597.8s)]
*  always had a very tense relationship [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=600.8s)]
*  with Israel's military establishment. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=603.4s)]
*  His main political rivals throughout the years, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=605.6s)]
*  Tzachat Rabin, Arik Sheaoun, Benny Gantz, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  Ehud Barak, were all former senior military officers. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=612.4s)]
*  And even though he sees them as timid, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=616.4s)]
*  he doesn't like their politics of being strong militarily [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=617.8s)]
*  but flexible diplomatically. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=621.4s)]
*  He doesn't like their ideas of conflict resolution. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  And clearly it came to a head, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=628.0s)]
*  and the price, you know, we all paid the price. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  But Netanyahu, since October 7, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=633.8s)]
*  has never once taken any iota of responsibility [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=635.4s)]
*  for what happened, both before the war and during the war, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=639.4s)]
*  or in planning and looking ahead towards the day after the war. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=644.1999999999999s)]
*  Many people, including President Biden, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=650.0s)]
*  have said that the response after October 7 [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=652.0s)]
*  has now become over the top. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=655.6s)]
*  And you see pushback around the world, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=657.6s)]
*  anti-Israeli sentiment, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=660.8s)]
*  because of the killings that have happened in Gaza, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=662.4s)]
*  because of the Israeli response. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=670.6s)]
*  Do you think it's been over the top, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=673.0s)]
*  and what would have the alternatives have been? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=675.4s)]
*  Look, I think the war was, and still is, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=681.2s)]
*  very, very popular among Israeli Jews. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=686.4000000000001s)]
*  Very popular and still enjoys wide support. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=690.0s)]
*  The main division, as I said, is what comes first, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=693.6s)]
*  releasing the hostages, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=697.4000000000001s)]
*  or destroying Hamas, or winning the war. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=699.2s)]
*  Now Netanyahu is talking about total victory [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=702.4000000000001s)]
*  without actually explaining what it means. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=704.6s)]
*  Look, Israel had to fight against Hamas [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=707.4000000000001s)]
*  because it would be very difficult to convince people [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=710.8s)]
*  to live not just along the border, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=713.8s)]
*  as they did before October 7, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=715.8s)]
*  and still have yet to come back, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  both around Gaza and around the Lebanese border, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  but also in other parts of Israel. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=723.5999999999999s)]
*  And clearly Hamas has been able to build [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=725.8s)]
*  a very sophisticated, by very simple means, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=728.8s)]
*  but a very sophisticated plan, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=733.0s)]
*  and deploy it without the idea of noticing. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=734.8s)]
*  So people are scared, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=738.1999999999999s)]
*  and they want to see victory against Hamas. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=739.4s)]
*  Now for most of the Israeli public, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=742.1999999999999s)]
*  they don't see what's happening in Gaza. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=743.6s)]
*  We at Haaretz are the only ones who even report, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=746.4s)]
*  in Hebrew, to Israeli audiences [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=750.1999999999999s)]
*  the level of damage and destruction in Gaza, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=752.4s)]
*  and killing, we interview people who live there. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=756.0s)]
*  It has zero resonance within the Israeli Jewish public, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=759.8s)]
*  which is a problem, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=764.0s)]
*  because then the military feels [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=766.1999999999999s)]
*  that they have a free hand to do whatever they want, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=768.6s)]
*  and look away, and look away, and turn, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=771.4s)]
*  and look away at looting, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=773.6s)]
*  and useless destruction, and so on. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=775.6s)]
*  At the same time, it's very difficult to fight [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=779.4s)]
*  a paramilitary group that is residing in tunnels, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=783.2s)]
*  underground tunnels and bunkers, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=786.2s)]
*  and that lives within the civil society in Gaza. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=788.4s)]
*  So it's very difficult to say what would be [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=793.4s)]
*  the exact point after which it's over the top. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  Clearly the operation in Ra'aqfa that involves [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=800.8000000000001s)]
*  getting into occupying an area [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=804.6s)]
*  that where most of the population of Gaza has fled to [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  is very complicated, and I don't see it coming. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=811.0s)]
*  It's imminent to happen tomorrow. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=814.2s)]
*  There is military reasoning to argue that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=817.0s)]
*  if you don't close, if you don't seal the Egyptian border [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=819.6s)]
*  and find a way to prevent further contraband [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=822.8s)]
*  getting into Gaza, and if you don't deal [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=827.4s)]
*  with the remaining Hamas force, you're at fault. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=829.8s)]
*  But then again, you have to protect these civilians there, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=833.0s)]
*  and you have to think of a way of them [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=836.4s)]
*  to get back to where they live, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=838.0s)]
*  whether it's where they lived before the war, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=840.1999999999999s)]
*  rebuild Gaza, and rebuild Gaza in a way [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=842.1999999999999s)]
*  that is not just aimed at building a force to fight Israel, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=845.5999999999999s)]
*  which they did, which they did, unfortunately, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=849.5999999999999s)]
*  very effectively in those years of siege. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=851.8s)]
*  Many within the Israeli leadership argue that this [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=854.5999999999999s)]
*  big response to October 7th was absolutely necessary, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  and you say that many Jews in Israel [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=864.0s)]
*  generally agree with that. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  Does that mean that this approach is not likely to change? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, look, if we judge by the past, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=874.1999999999999s)]
*  whenever Israel was taken by surprise, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=877.4s)]
*  either by Egypt and Syria in 1973 Yom Kippur War, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=880.4s)]
*  or by the first and second Palestinian Intifada, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=885.0s)]
*  usually there is a major shift towards the right, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=887.4s)]
*  and toward just use more force and deploy more soldiers [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=891.1999999999999s)]
*  and just crush them. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=896.1999999999999s)]
*  But then after a while, people realize that [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=898.0s)]
*  this is not a long-term solution for coexistence, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=901.0s)]
*  prosperity, and security, and therefore, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=904.6s)]
*  they try to seek a diplomatic peaceful solution. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=907.8s)]
*  Which again, it's never an end in itself. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=912.0s)]
*  And what we know now after 50 years of peace processing [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=914.4s)]
*  is that it's a living organism that you need to feed [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=918.0s)]
*  and you need to worry about. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not just signing something [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=922.8s)]
*  and then throwing the story away the key. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=924.5999999999999s)]
*  So do you think that there's a possibility [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=928.0s)]
*  of a peace process towards a two-state solution [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=930.8s)]
*  once this is over? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=934.4s)]
*  I'm, look, I belong to a minority of optimists [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=936.4s)]
*  in this part of the world where usually pessimism is there, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=941.0s)]
*  is the surest way to be right most of the time. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=944.6s)]
*  Yes, I believe there is. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=948.6s)]
*  The big question is who could play the role? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=949.8s)]
*  The leader of Egypt who went to war in 73 [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=953.0s)]
*  and then four years later came to Jerusalem [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=956.0s)]
*  and eventually signed a peace treaty that is still holding [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  despite his assassination a couple years after. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=960.8s)]
*  But what President Biden is trying to do is to fill in [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=964.4s)]
*  for the lack of that kind of Palestinian leader with MBS, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=969.0s)]
*  with the leader of Saudi Arabia and make him sort of [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=973.4s)]
*  the custodian of that peace process in return for [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=976.8s)]
*  whatever security guarantees and other goodies [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=980.4s)]
*  that Saudi Arabia wants from the United States. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=983.4s)]
*  It's a very long shot, but it can be the beginning of something. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=986.8s)]
*  And we must remember it took several years [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=990.6s)]
*  from the Kissinger shuttle diplomacy to the peace treaty [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=993.0s)]
*  that eventually was signed when Carter was president. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=998.0s)]
*  It took a while from Baker's Madrid conference [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1000.4s)]
*  to the Oslo Accords signed at the front yard of Bill Clinton, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1004.4s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1010.0s)]
*  So it's not something that is going to happen tomorrow. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1011.2s)]
*  But I hope that the Israeli public opinion would also realize [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1014.2s)]
*  that the Netanyahu approach and the right-wing approach [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1018.2s)]
*  is a wrong approach because it only brings more tragedy [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1021.0s)]
*  and more problems afterwards, even if immediately it's seen [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1026.3999999999999s)]
*  as the only way to deal with the problem. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1031.3999999999999s)]
*  Olaf Ben, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1033.8s)]
*  Thank you, Walter. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohUKJbZrG68&t=1037.2s)]
