*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=42.3s)]
*  Walter, great to be with you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=43.9s)]
*  You know, about 40 years ago, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=45.2s)]
*  you wrote from Beirut to Jerusalem. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=47.14s)]
*  Ever since then, you've been going back [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=49.739999999999995s)]
*  to the Middle East after [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=51.44s)]
*  the October 7th attack. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  You went to Israel, then you've been [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=55.88s)]
*  And you're now saying something [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  that actually makes my head snap a bit. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=59.540000000000006s)]
*  And I want you to explain it, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=62.02s)]
*  which is Netanyahu, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=63.34s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=65.36s)]
*  is the worst leader [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=66.88s)]
*  in Israel's history. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=69.22s)]
*  And then you say not only that, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=70.92s)]
*  he's the worst leader in Jewish history. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  Explain that to me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=75.22s)]
*  Why so strong? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=76.12s)]
*  Well, he's been prime minister, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  presided over the worst loss [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=80.6s)]
*  of life for Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=83.74000000000001s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=85.52s)]
*  And a lot of what happened here [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=87.46s)]
*  is a product of his actions [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=90.2s)]
*  in several ways. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=91.56s)]
*  One was the whole security [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=92.44s)]
*  structure on the border. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=94.3s)]
*  He's been prime minister [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=95.4s)]
*  for all these years, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=96.36s)]
*  so he is surely partly [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=97.1s)]
*  responsible for that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=98.84s)]
*  It was a complete failure. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=100.34s)]
*  Secondly, his strategy was actually to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=102.2s)]
*  divide the Palestinian authority [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=105.82s)]
*  on the West Bank that has supported [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=108.38s)]
*  the Oslo peace process [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=109.92s)]
*  and the Hamas militia [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza and to do that deliberately [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=115.28s)]
*  so that Palestinians [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  would never be united [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=119.66000000000001s)]
*  to be able to be a partner [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=121.12s)]
*  in any kind of peace process. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=123.42s)]
*  That was a deliberate policy [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=124.86s)]
*  in Netanyahu, which included [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=126.22s)]
*  getting more than a billion dollars [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  transferred from Qatar to Hamas. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=129.6s)]
*  Money had siphoned off eventually [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=132.24s)]
*  to build this incredible [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=133.84s)]
*  underground network [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=135.70000000000002s)]
*  and military machine. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=136.6s)]
*  And most of all, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=138.9s)]
*  we are at a moment, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=140.4s)]
*  Walter Rich is so clear that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=142.58s)]
*  Israel right now, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  if it had a leadership [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=146.6s)]
*  ready to engage [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=148.84s)]
*  and it would have to be [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=151.34s)]
*  a long term process [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=152.34s)]
*  on a two state solution, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=153.28s)]
*  we actually solved [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=154.98000000000002s)]
*  three really important problems [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  for Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=159.12s)]
*  One, although Israel was attacked [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=160.02s)]
*  by Hamas viciously to start this war, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=162.76s)]
*  it somehow has lost the global narrative [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=165.4s)]
*  because of its retaliation [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=167.76s)]
*  and the massive loss of life [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=169.46s)]
*  of Palestinians. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=170.84s)]
*  Secondly, Israel has no plan [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=172.46s)]
*  for exiting Gaza for the morning after, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=174.88s)]
*  for having a Palestinian partner [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=176.96s)]
*  to rule Gaza. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=178.72s)]
*  So Israel doesn't have to do it forever. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  And lastly, Israel faces a regional [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=181.8s)]
*  onslaught right now from Iran [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  and its proxies, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=186.84s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=188.1s)]
*  and Shaitan militias and Iraq. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=189.70000000000002s)]
*  That regional threat to Israel [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=191.6s)]
*  requires a regional alliance to counter. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=193.58s)]
*  And it's very hard to get [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=196.08s)]
*  that regional alliance [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  without the cement of some kind [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=198.34s)]
*  of Israeli-Palestinian peace process. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=200.16000000000003s)]
*  So for all those reasons, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  I think Netanyahu has a lot to answer for today [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=203.94000000000003s)]
*  and to Jewish history. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=207.38000000000002s)]
*  You know, we talk about the phrase [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=209.0s)]
*  from the river to the sea, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=211.08s)]
*  as if it's maybe saying [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=213.14000000000001s)]
*  we should get rid of not only the state of Israel, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=215.44s)]
*  but Jews from the region. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=217.58s)]
*  And I think a lot of people [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=219.38000000000002s)]
*  find that horrifying. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  And yet I've just heard Netanyahu [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  and he's been on the social media posting acts [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=224.52s)]
*  saying things that seem [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=227.36s)]
*  slightly similar to me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=228.84s)]
*  I think he posted, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=230.18s)]
*  I will not compromise on full Israeli security [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=231.32000000000002s)]
*  over all the territory west of Jordan. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=234.46s)]
*  And this is contrary to a Palestinian state. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=237.02s)]
*  Is that a mistake? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  And is that gonna turn the world against Israel after this? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=242.12s)]
*  You know, I don't think any one statement can do it Walter, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=246.0s)]
*  but basically, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=248.5s)]
*  you know, what's different about this Israeli-Palestinian [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  conflict from previous ones, I would argue, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=253.54000000000002s)]
*  is that it's being driven [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=256.14s)]
*  by the worst of the worst on both sides. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=257.4s)]
*  It's actually being driven by the far right, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=260.21999999999997s)]
*  who Bibi is a captive of. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  He needs them to stay in power. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=264.64s)]
*  So he looks like he's driving the car, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=266.67999999999995s)]
*  but he's actually not. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=269.52s)]
*  His far right partners are directing him [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=270.82s)]
*  where to turn right and where to turn left [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=273.23999999999995s)]
*  or where not to turn left. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=274.91999999999996s)]
*  And the Palestinians are being led not by Abu Mazen, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=277.29999999999995s)]
*  the Palestinian authority that embraced [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=281.88s)]
*  the Oslo peace process, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  by Hamas, which is dedicated [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=285.08s)]
*  to eliminating the Jewish state. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=287.28s)]
*  What the far right in Israel and Hamas have in common [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=289.58s)]
*  is something to which you just alluded. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  They both want it all from the river to the sea. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=295.68s)]
*  In an interview with Chris John Amanpour on Monday, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=299.24s)]
*  your old friend, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=303.14s)]
*  the former prime minister of the Palestinian authority, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=304.56s)]
*  Salam Fayyad said, and I wanna quote it for you, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=307.32s)]
*  the Palestinian authority as currently constituted [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=311.32s)]
*  cannot really continue to govern [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=315.4s)]
*  and certainly cannot assume the responsibility [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=318.2s)]
*  of taking care of the needs of the people in Gaza, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=320.92s)]
*  in addition to the West Bank. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=324.08s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=326.8s)]
*  Yeah, they have a 87 year old leader in Mahmoud Abbas [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=328.48s)]
*  who presides over a corrupt [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=336.64s)]
*  and ineffective Palestinian authority. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=338.3s)]
*  Anyone who's worked this story for a long time [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=341.68s)]
*  knows the kind of talent you actually have [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=343.68s)]
*  in the Palestinian community. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=347.8s)]
*  You see it in the business community. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=348.94s)]
*  You see it among academics and artists. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=350.7s)]
*  There is real talent there, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=354.44s)]
*  like in America and a lot of other countries. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=356.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, they're not running the show, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=358.36s)]
*  but you need a much more serious, credible, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=360.42s)]
*  new generation of Palestinians on their side. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=365.08s)]
*  And what people like Salam Fayyad have been talking about [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=368.48s)]
*  is maybe the PLO, the umbrella organization [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=372.52s)]
*  for the Palestinians, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=375.62s)]
*  sort of only legitimate umbrella organization, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=376.52s)]
*  appoint a technocratic government, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=379.4s)]
*  the best of Palestinians that would actually run [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=381.52s)]
*  the West Bank and Gaza in partnership, obviously, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=385.48s)]
*  with Israel to some degree for the next couple of years. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=388.48s)]
*  And then once the situation is truly stabilized, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=393.44s)]
*  then you have elections within the Palestinian community [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=395.76s)]
*  for a truly legitimate government [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=399.42s)]
*  that could actually negotiate a legitimate peace deal [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  with the Israelis. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  So some variation of that is what we need. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=406.46000000000004s)]
*  Whether we can get there, I don't know. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=409.58000000000004s)]
*  You say we have to have even a broader plan [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=411.62s)]
*  for the morning after the morning after. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  Israel doesn't have that. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=416.82s)]
*  What would be your plan, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=418.74s)]
*  and what do you think that President Biden is doing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=420.42s)]
*  in terms of sort of a dual track [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=423.90000000000003s)]
*  to try to get a plan for the morning after this? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=425.94s)]
*  Yeah, well, what Biden is trying to do, Walter, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=428.94s)]
*  is actually present Netanyahu with a choice, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=431.32s)]
*  but a very public choice. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=434.85999999999996s)]
*  And that is you can do nothing [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=437.0s)]
*  and go down the track you're going to nowhere on. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  Or if you're ready to engage with the Palestinians [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=444.73999999999995s)]
*  on a plan, it would have to be a long-term plan, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=448.96s)]
*  but where there are two states for two people [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=451.5s)]
*  at the end of it, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=453.58s)]
*  we can actually deliver for you [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=454.7s)]
*  in partnership with Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=457.02s)]
*  normalization with Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=458.94s)]
*  and an opening really to the rest of the Muslim world, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=461.09999999999997s)]
*  which would be huge for Israel. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=463.9s)]
*  So what Biden is trying to do is actually, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=465.76s)]
*  I have a lot of Israeli friends calling me up saying, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=467.9s)]
*  hey, would you tell Joe Biden to get rid of Bibi Netanyahu? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  And I say, guys, it doesn't work that way, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=473.58s)]
*  except in the movies, okay? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  What Biden's trying to do is present a choice [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=477.65999999999997s)]
*  that all Israelis will see. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=480.7s)]
*  Here's a real opportunity for the future [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=483.5s)]
*  to bury the past, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=486.06s)]
*  and here's a way for the past to bury the future you choose. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=487.42s)]
*  My one concern, I'm a big Joe Biden fan, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=490.70000000000005s)]
*  but one thing I've learned, Walter, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=493.74s)]
*  in 45 plus years of covering this region, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  what people tell you in English in private is irrelevant. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=497.90000000000003s)]
*  All that matters is what they will defend in public [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=502.82000000000005s)]
*  in their own language called Hebrew and Arabic. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=505.5s)]
*  So I get a little frightened when I hear Biden say, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=508.58000000000004s)]
*  well, yeah, I know Bibi's saying this in public, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=511.94s)]
*  but he told me something else. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=515.26s)]
*  Oh my God, if I had a dime for every time, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=517.02s)]
*  Bibi told an American president, diplomat, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=520.06s)]
*  or secretary of state that I could retire a long time ago. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=522.18s)]
*  So we have to be very careful. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=527.48s)]
*  What people tell you in private in English is irrelevant. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=528.9s)]
*  All that matters is what they'll defend in public [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=533.1s)]
*  in Hebrew or Arabic, and that's all I listen for. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=535.76s)]
*  Well, you say that Netanyahu will be presented [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=539.38s)]
*  with a choice by the Biden administration, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=542.9799999999999s)]
*  can and should President Biden put pressure on him? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=545.5799999999999s)]
*  And I go back, you wrote about it, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  to Henry Kissinger in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=553.9s)]
*  where very subtly, I think the US withheld some resupply [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=557.88s)]
*  for the Israeli military in order to put pressure on Israel. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=563.72s)]
*  Should Biden do that? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=569.52s)]
*  You know, I honestly believe, Walter, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=571.28s)]
*  I'm not trying to avoid your question. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=572.56s)]
*  I think if Biden could engineer that choice, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=574.26s)]
*  the pressure you would get is the most meaningful pressure [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=577.8s)]
*  of all, and it'd be from the bottom up [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=580.52s)]
*  inside the Israeli system. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=582.18s)]
*  I can't tell you exactly where it would come out, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=583.92s)]
*  but I think if he were able to present that choice, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=586.08s)]
*  the most important pressure has to be from Israelis, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  and I think it would manifest itself. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=593.2s)]
*  So that's what I'm thinking about right now. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=597.52s)]
*  Netanyahu, is he motivated by going down in history [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=599.88s)]
*  and getting this solved for the state of Israel, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  or is he mainly motivated by saving his skin [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=607.16s)]
*  and his own politics? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=609.44s)]
*  Well, there's anything we know about Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=611.0s)]
*  His number one priority is Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=612.88s)]
*  Look, even in the middle of this war, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=616.7199999999999s)]
*  I think where we are now, this war started on October 7th. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=620.04s)]
*  His government still cannot tell you [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=623.12s)]
*  what their plan is for the morning after. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=625.28s)]
*  He can't even hold a cabinet meeting to discuss that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=627.04s)]
*  with his cabinet and senior military and security people [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=631.0s)]
*  because his far right simply refuses [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=634.4s)]
*  to have any Palestinian authority [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=637.92s)]
*  or a Palestinian state component as part of that discussion. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=640.68s)]
*  Can you imagine being in a war, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=644.8s)]
*  and your army's exposed, your people are exposed, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=646.76s)]
*  and you can't even hold a cabinet meeting? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=650.68s)]
*  Now, instead of saying to that far right, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=653.4399999999999s)]
*  too bad, bring down the government, okay, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=655.12s)]
*  if that's what you're gonna do. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=658.24s)]
*  I don't believe you'll do it, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=659.1999999999999s)]
*  but if you wanna bring down the government, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=661.04s)]
*  that's a hill I'll die on. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=662.5999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu said, okay, there'll be no cabinet meeting. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=664.24s)]
*  And then he'll tell Biden something, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=668.0s)]
*  if you scratch your ear with your left hand, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=671.3199999999999s)]
*  somehow it'll all be, we'll figure it all out. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=673.24s)]
*  And so this is just an impossible situation for Israel [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=675.92s)]
*  to navigate its way out of when you have a prime minister [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=681.96s)]
*  whose first priority is his political survival. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=685.44s)]
*  But if Netanyahu keeps doing that, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=688.16s)]
*  should the US continue to have unalloyed support [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=690.92s)]
*  and send munitions? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=695.6s)]
*  Yeah, for me, that's very context related, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=698.24s)]
*  and I'm always wary of making some general statement [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=701.8000000000001s)]
*  that we should be withdrawing military support [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=705.9200000000001s)]
*  because who knows what's going on in the ground. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=708.84s)]
*  I think the much more effective thing is for Joe Biden [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=710.64s)]
*  to give a speech directly to the Israeli people [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=713.96s)]
*  about just what their prime minister is doing [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=717.2s)]
*  and just what the implications will be [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=719.36s)]
*  for Israel's relation with its closest friend, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=721.6s)]
*  some days its only friend in the world. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=724.84s)]
*  After the October 7th attacks, after the retaliation, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=727.24s)]
*  you went to Israel and you said, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=731.0s)]
*  I have never been to this Israel before. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=733.08s)]
*  What'd you mean by that? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=736.08s)]
*  I meant two things, Walter. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=737.32s)]
*  It was Israel that had truly lost confidence [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=738.44s)]
*  in its army and intelligence services. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  This was not a surprise attack by another state, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  like Egypt and Syria. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=749.24s)]
*  This was a surprise attack by a militia in Gaza [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=750.36s)]
*  that lives literally right under Israel's nose [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=754.44s)]
*  that did just enormous damage. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=757.2s)]
*  So on the one end, there was this really, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=759.48s)]
*  a real profound loss of confidence. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  And the other, because of the attacks from Hezbollah [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=763.7600000000001s)]
*  and Lebanon in parallel with the Hamas attacks from Gaza, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  basically had shrunk Israel. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=771.24s)]
*  Some 80,000 Israelis had to move off the Northern border. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=773.5200000000001s)]
*  Some 40, 50,000, I don't know the number of Israelis [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=777.72s)]
*  have now we have to move off its Western border. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=781.48s)]
*  And the Israel that we had all known [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=784.7600000000001s)]
*  had actually shrunk almost down to the size [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=788.16s)]
*  of its 1947 partition map, if you thought about it, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=791.36s)]
*  especially if you added parts of the West Bank [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=796.36s)]
*  that had become no-go zones. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=798.08s)]
*  And so this has been extremely disorienting for Israel. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=800.36s)]
*  And the trauma of the hostage taking [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=803.88s)]
*  has been really profound. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=806.32s)]
*  And that's why I'm so focused on getting the hostages [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=808.88s)]
*  back for Israel, cause I don't think Israel [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=811.6s)]
*  will be able to think straight. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=813.8s)]
*  I'm not saying this in any light way [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=815.12s)]
*  until it gets the hostages back. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=817.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think only then, God willing, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=819.76s)]
*  they get their hostages back, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=822.3199999999999s)]
*  only then I think can they maybe have [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=824.12s)]
*  a more rational discussion about the future [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=826.64s)]
*  and their future relationship with the Palestinians. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=829.7199999999999s)]
*  One metric in a situation like this is, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=832.4799999999999s)]
*  are you creating more terrorists than you're killing? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=836.2399999999999s)]
*  Do you think the response by Israel is proportionate? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=841.28s)]
*  Or do you think it is actually going to cause Israel harm? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=845.08s)]
*  Yeah, I very much worry that the amount [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  of civilian casualties in Gaza, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=853.4000000000001s)]
*  that the long run implications of that, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=856.36s)]
*  it will be very serious and troubling [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=860.0s)]
*  and problematic for Israel. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=861.9200000000001s)]
*  That said, we have to remember one thing, Walter, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=864.5600000000001s)]
*  we can ask the Israeli government any question we want, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  any day, and you'll get an answer [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=872.8399999999999s)]
*  from the military spokesman or the prime minister spokesman. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=874.52s)]
*  You may not like the answer, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=877.92s)]
*  may not be full or complete, may not even be straight, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=879.3599999999999s)]
*  but you'll get an answer. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=882.04s)]
*  No one is asked one question to Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=883.9599999999999s)]
*  He hasn't had an answer one question. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=889.4399999999999s)]
*  Why did your men, they actually raped people. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  This is the way of independent reports of this. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=896.88s)]
*  They shot parents in front of their kids. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=899.4799999999999s)]
*  They shot kids in front of their parents. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=901.44s)]
*  They abducted infants and grandparents. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=903.8000000000001s)]
*  Was that in your orders? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=907.36s)]
*  What was that about? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=909.24s)]
*  And so, man, I'm deeply disturbed [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=910.8800000000001s)]
*  by the amount of civilian casualties in this war. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=914.9200000000001s)]
*  I repeat, it will be, I think, a real stain [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  on Israel in the long run. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=922.0s)]
*  But let's remember that Hamas basically built [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=924.0s)]
*  its military infrastructure underneath [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=928.36s)]
*  and alongside civilians, launched this war, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=931.56s)]
*  knowing what the Israeli response would be, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=934.92s)]
*  and that they bear enormous culpability in this as well. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=938.36s)]
*  And so I think we have to ask, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=942.12s)]
*  what's gonna be the reaction for Hamas [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=943.68s)]
*  in the long run from that as well? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=946.4s)]
*  A former president, Donald Trump, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=948.56s)]
*  now seems, after New Hampshire, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=950.72s)]
*  to be pretty clearly on the way [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=952.4s)]
*  to the Republican nomination. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=954.12s)]
*  During his administration, there was the Abraham Accords, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=956.24s)]
*  which started the rapprochement with the Saudis [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=958.96s)]
*  and perhaps a road to a two-state solution. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=961.64s)]
*  Do you see any merit into where he was going, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=964.52s)]
*  and how do you think he would handle this? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=967.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, let's ask ourselves, Walter, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=971.2800000000001s)]
*  what's the biggest problem we have today? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=974.32s)]
*  The biggest problem we have today [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=978.0400000000001s)]
*  is we're actually in a proxy war with Iran. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=979.88s)]
*  And Iran has enormous leverage on us [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=983.9200000000001s)]
*  because we have two aircraft carriers in the region. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=986.12s)]
*  Iran has four, what I call, land craft carriers. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=989.72s)]
*  The Houthis in Yemen, Hamas in Gaza, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=992.96s)]
*  Isbal in Lebanon, and Shia militias in Iraq. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=995.8s)]
*  And like our aircraft carriers, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=998.72s)]
*  they are platforms through which Iran projects power [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1000.88s)]
*  with what I call implausible deniability [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1004.84s)]
*  that is actually involved, okay? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1007.6s)]
*  And so it's in a very strong position, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1010.16s)]
*  but the reason it's in such a strong position [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1012.64s)]
*  is because Iran is now just weeks away, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1016.96s)]
*  a few screws of the screwdriver, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1019.72s)]
*  a few turns of the screwdriver away from a nuclear weapon. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1022.56s)]
*  Now, how did it get there? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1026.28s)]
*  It got there because Donald Trump tore up [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1028.2s)]
*  Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran, which was working, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1032.2s)]
*  which kept Iran a year away from a bomb. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1036.72s)]
*  And Trump did that without talk about no plan [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1039.84s)]
*  for the morning after, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  with no diplomatic plan to get a better deal [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1045.2s)]
*  or any military plan to deal with Iran [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1047.96s)]
*  if it then went ahead and did just what it did, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1050.56s)]
*  which was continue to enrich at a much higher level [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1053.28s)]
*  and bring itself to the threshold of a bomb. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1056.0s)]
*  That is Donald Trump and Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1059.3999999999999s)]
*  they did this together. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oScC3S2N0uo&t=1061.6399999999999s)]
