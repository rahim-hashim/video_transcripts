# Richard Haass: Israel Needs Political Strategy in the Wake of Sinwar Killing | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ)
*  Well, OK, so interestingly, one of your former colleagues, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Dennis Ross, who's the former Middle East negotiator, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=2.64s)]
*  was on X today saying, with the Hamas leaders in Gaza gone, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=5.7s)]
*  Israel should say it'll end the war, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=10.18s)]
*  provided the hostages are released. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=12.22s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=14.6s)]
*  And just earlier, he had said a couple of weeks ago, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=15.44s)]
*  the pagers, the killing of Nasrallah, the head [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=18.92s)]
*  of Hezbollah, et cetera, was all good military and intelligence [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=21.7s)]
*  victories. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=28.46s)]
*  But where is the plan? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=29.06s)]
*  Where is the political plan? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=31.2s)]
*  And that he wanted to see a political strategy laid out. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=32.42s)]
*  Do you see any political strategy? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=36.36s)]
*  Short answer is no. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=41.76s)]
*  I don't see it vis-a-vis Hezbollah in the north. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=43.12s)]
*  Again, is it simply to try to get a situation, a ceasefire, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=47.04s)]
*  so that 60,000 to 70,000 Israelis can go back [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=50.76s)]
*  to their homes in northern Israel? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=54.14s)]
*  Or is it to try to do more? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=55.96s)]
*  Are the Israelis really trying to get rid of Hezbollah [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=57.74s)]
*  once and for all? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=60.86s)]
*  Is that even achievable? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=61.86s)]
*  I have, to put it mildly, profound doubts. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=63.1s)]
*  Now in Gaza, similar first order questions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=66.62s)]
*  What are the Israelis trying to accomplish? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=69.5s)]
*  Is it to get the hostages out? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=71.5s)]
*  Is it to get an Arab force in there? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=73.46s)]
*  More and more military operations [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  may somewhat degrade Hamas even more, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=78.22s)]
*  but it's not going to eliminate it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=81.1s)]
*  And the process of killing people [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=82.74s)]
*  also creates more recruits. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=84.38s)]
*  So again, this is a moment to think strategically. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=86.82s)]
*  Tactics added to tactics added to tactics [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=89.6s)]
*  don't add up to a strategy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=92.36s)]
*  And that's what's been missing from the get-go, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=94.08s)]
*  whether it's in the north or for the last year in Gaza. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=96.72s)]
*  It's as if at times books like On War by Klausowitz [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=100.36s)]
*  were never translated into Hebrew. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=104.16s)]
*  I just don't quite understand what the Israeli thinking is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=106.28s)]
*  about where they want this all to lead. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=110.47999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so to play devil's advocate, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=112.3s)]
*  I would quote you some of the Israeli officials, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=114.16s)]
*  including the UK-based ambassador [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=116.32s)]
*  and a lot of Prime Minister Netanyahu's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=119.13999999999999s)]
*  extreme right flank say the strategy [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=122.02s)]
*  is to remake the Middle East, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=125.58s)]
*  to end once and for all what they call [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  the ring of fire around Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=129.94s)]
*  And that's why they say Iran is the head of the octopus [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=131.82s)]
*  and that has to be decapitated. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=134.78s)]
*  So your view on what you think Israel will do, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=136.82s)]
*  because it's bound to respond eventually, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=140.72s)]
*  sooner rather than later probably, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=143.12s)]
*  it's obviously feeling successful and empowered, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=144.72s)]
*  Sinwa is gone, Nasrallah is gone, et cetera. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=147.48s)]
*  What do you foresee as the result [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=150.88s)]
*  or the impact of a strike on Iran? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=155.1s)]
*  Well again, so much of a strike, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=159.26s)]
*  the impact of a strike on Iran [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=160.92s)]
*  depends upon its scale and the target set. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  I've been advocating the Israelis focus on sites [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=165.32s)]
*  with that either produce or store things like missiles [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=169.44s)]
*  or drones rather than expanding the confrontation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=172.94s)]
*  Iran's still sitting on close to what, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=177.14s)]
*  3000 ballistic missiles, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=179.42s)]
*  that's far more than Israel can handle [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  even with American help. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=183.26s)]
*  I'm not sure a much larger war with Iran [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=184.94s)]
*  serves anyone's interest right now. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=187.61999999999998s)]
*  So I would hope the Israelis would think about that. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=191.94s)]
*  Let me make a more basic point, Christiane. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=194.54s)]
*  Israel has had military advances [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=196.85999999999999s)]
*  both in the North as well as in Gaza. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  But war is not simply a military undertaking. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  There has gotta be a political component [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=204.72s)]
*  of what you're doing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=207.4s)]
*  You can't simply sideline Hamas through attacking them. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=208.32000000000002s)]
*  You've got to allow the emergence [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=213.28s)]
*  of another political entity [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=214.86s)]
*  that Palestinians can rally around. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=216.22s)]
*  And that's what I see missing from Israeli strategy. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  You're not gonna create a situation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=222.74s)]
*  where you're not gonna have armed Palestinian resistance [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  including the West Bank [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  simply by reducing Iranian support for Palestinians. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=228.18s)]
*  There will also be indigenous support [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=232.06s)]
*  and opposition to Israel coming from Palestinians [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=234.18s)]
*  in both Gaza and Hamas. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=236.98s)]
*  Again, it calls out for a political dimension [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=238.5s)]
*  of Israeli foreign policy to coexist [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=241.9s)]
*  with what they do in the military. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=245.9s)]
*  So finally, there's obviously a US election on the doorstep. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=248.22s)]
*  What would you advise, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=253.9s)]
*  what should the US do right now [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=255.7s)]
*  in terms of advising the Israeli government? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=257.86s)]
*  What should be its posture now? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=260.8s)]
*  I would say, let's take three venues very quickly. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=265.18s)]
*  In the North, I would work for a ceasefire [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  so Israelis can return home to their, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=270.44s)]
*  in the North of Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=272.64s)]
*  So these 60 or 70,000 Israelis can resume a life. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=274.16s)]
*  I would try to get a deal in Gaza [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=277.6s)]
*  to get the hostages out to get a ceasefire. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=281.0s)]
*  And I would press Israel as hard as one could, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=283.34000000000003s)]
*  publicly and privately, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  to introduce a political component, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=288.18s)]
*  to lay out some type of trajectory for the Palestinians [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=289.7s)]
*  to at least realize some of their ambitions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=294.06s)]
*  I would press Israel for a narrow military response [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=296.94s)]
*  for the moment against Iran. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=300.18s)]
*  That to me, again, it doesn't solve the Middle East. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=302.82s)]
*  The Middle East, I don't think is a problem to be solved. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=304.94s)]
*  And I get nervous when I hear people talking [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=307.53999999999996s)]
*  about regime change and other such things. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=309.74s)]
*  Middle East is a situation to be managed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  And I would press the Israelis to avoid overreaching, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=314.42s)]
*  to think that they can solve a part of the world [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=318.24s)]
*  that I believe resists solution. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykKdL1R7SzQ&t=321.12s)]
