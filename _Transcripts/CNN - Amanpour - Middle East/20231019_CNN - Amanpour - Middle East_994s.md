# How the Mideast Crisis Is Igniting a War of Words on College Campuses | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM)
*  Now, protests have been spilling out onto U.S. college campuses [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=0.0s)]
*  over the crisis in the Middle East between those who support Israel [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=4.1s)]
*  and those who support Palestinians. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=7.54s)]
*  Jack Stripling is an investigative reporter at The Washington Post [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  covering higher education, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=13.1s)]
*  and he joins Harif Sreenivasan with that story. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=14.94s)]
*  Chris John, thanks. Jack Stripling, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  You are an investigative reporter in The Higher Ed beat in The Washington Post, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=22.14s)]
*  and over the past week, we have seen so much activity on college campuses, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=25.759999999999998s)]
*  protests and counter protests, students in support of Palestine, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=30.88s)]
*  in support of Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=36.12s)]
*  What are you seeing play out across the country here? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, this really is a continuation of a longstanding phenomenon [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=41.36s)]
*  within higher education. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=45.28s)]
*  I mean, of course, protest around international conflicts [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=46.56s)]
*  and the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=51.04s)]
*  United States, but particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=55.06s)]
*  has generated over decades, enormous amounts of protests, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=59.16s)]
*  political pressure, pressure from students for colleges [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=63.14s)]
*  to do any number of things related to the conflict, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  whether that's to divest from Israel, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=69.1s)]
*  whether that's to boycott study abroad programs in Israel. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=71.04s)]
*  So this is a longstanding issue that has, of course, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=75.64s)]
*  hit a flash point because of the current circumstances in the conflict. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=79.24s)]
*  Last week, we saw pictures of a billboard going around Harvard [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=84.33999999999999s)]
*  with the names and photos of students that were members [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=90.44s)]
*  of multiple groups on campus. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=94.78s)]
*  Let's kind of unpack that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=96.78s)]
*  What did those students do to get their faces and names on a billboard? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=98.72s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=102.72s)]
*  The early on, there was a statement that was put out [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=104.08s)]
*  by a group of student groups at Harvard University [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=108.44s)]
*  that held Israel solely responsible for the violence occurring in Gaza and Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=112.17999999999999s)]
*  This immediately was met with tons of public backlash. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=118.88s)]
*  There were efforts, I think, to identify who the students were, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=122.92s)]
*  that their organizations names were there, but not the names of the students. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=126.08s)]
*  And I think things really ratcheted up when Larry Summers, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=130.34s)]
*  who's a former president of Harvard and also a former secretary of treasury, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  went on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  and really condemned Harvard for its slow response to the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=142.48s)]
*  conflict. By that point, a lot of universities had already put out public statements [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  and specifically condemning these student groups. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  And so that generated a lot of interest in them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  And then in the ensuing days, as you note, I think there have been [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  numerous efforts to identify who these students are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Some of them appear to have suffered some professional consequences [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=163.48s)]
*  as a result of this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=167.82s)]
*  So that's kind of how this began. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=169.48s)]
*  But that statement really attracted a ton of attention. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=172.16s)]
*  Now, there were some very prominent CEOs, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=176.32s)]
*  Bill Ackman, the head of a large hedge fund, being one of them, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=180.42s)]
*  that started to call for the names of all of the student members [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=184.72s)]
*  so that he says so that he didn't have to hire them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=190.18s)]
*  I mean, and then there was an issue at NYU [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=194.08s)]
*  where one of the students that was a member of these organizations had [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=197.78s)]
*  what is it, their job offer rescinded? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=202.46s)]
*  Yeah, so there have been a few incidents like this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=205.32s)]
*  I know there's a prominent law firm that initially said it would not hire [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=209.58s)]
*  some of the students who were affiliated with these groups. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=213.22s)]
*  There's been more recent reporting that's saying, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=216.85999999999999s)]
*  well, we're going to hire some, but not all of these students, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=219.72s)]
*  depending on their level of involvement. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=222.1s)]
*  But it's an interesting phenomenon, because I do think that in the history [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=224.5s)]
*  of student activism around any number of issues, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  but particularly this one, which is so divisive around the world, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=232.5s)]
*  you know, I think 20 years ago, a student could could go out [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=236.76s)]
*  and protest about something like this, and a future employer would be none [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=240.1s)]
*  the wiser. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=243.92s)]
*  Of course, now they're performing on a world stage through social media [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=245.06s)]
*  and the pressure points and the consequences are far more profound [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  as a result. When I talk about this with my friends, what's interesting [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=253.16000000000003s)]
*  is, is that there's, you know, a group of folks that say, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=257.02s)]
*  listen, when you sign your name on something, kind of be ready for it [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=260.56s)]
*  to be to be in the front page of The Washington Post and The New York Times. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=264.0s)]
*  I mean, you've got to take responsibility for what you're signing your name onto. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=267.22s)]
*  And maybe this is a life lesson. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=270.76s)]
*  And then I also hear people saying, gosh, this this guy's [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  has a little bit of a smell of McCarthyism. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=276.1s)]
*  You know, who's a card carrying member of which group? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=278.88s)]
*  And am I going to blackball them and not hire them? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=281.24s)]
*  I think this these are great points, and it's something that the colleges [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=283.88s)]
*  themselves really struggle with, right? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=287.1s)]
*  They they want to by design be to use a word safe spaces [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=289.14s)]
*  for for students and faculty to express themselves on any number of issues. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=294.48s)]
*  But they are living in an environment where people can be doxed, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=300.44s)]
*  people can be found. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=304.38s)]
*  There can be efforts to snuff out who said what. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=305.52s)]
*  And I think that college leaders are really struggling with that [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=308.21999999999997s)]
*  from a safety standpoint. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=310.94s)]
*  There is a there's a great concern that students have put themselves at risk [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=312.88s)]
*  by taking hard line positions on this issue. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=316.18s)]
*  And I think that university leaders are legitimately flummoxed [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=318.78s)]
*  about how to allow the free exchange of ideas [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=322.64s)]
*  and free expression that institutions of higher education [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=327.12s)]
*  value and hold so dear while also recognizing that 18 to 20 year olds [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=330.38s)]
*  may say things that are more strident [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=335.48s)]
*  about a nuanced issue than than they might, you know, 10 years later. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=338.36s)]
*  And that's just something the colleges confront, I think, all the time. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=342.21999999999997s)]
*  It's not that we, you know, you shouldn't be held responsible, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  but it's also very strange because [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=348.86s)]
*  old people like us, I guess, it kind of assume that college is the point [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=352.28s)]
*  in your life where you are mentally experimenting. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=356.38s)]
*  Trying, you know, kind of different things on figuring out parts of yourself [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=360.32s)]
*  and attending a protest for whatever side of whatever argument [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=365.56s)]
*  seems like something that you do in college. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=369.76s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to be, you know, careful to say that having talked [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=374.0s)]
*  to college students over, you know, 20 years of covering higher education, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=377.76s)]
*  you know, these are people who are often very well educated on these issues. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=382.36s)]
*  And I don't want to give the impression, you know, that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=385.86s)]
*  these poor experimental students have whoops and said something [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=389.5s)]
*  that they're going to regret later. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=393.03999999999996s)]
*  These are deeply held beliefs that I think a lot of the students [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=395.2s)]
*  will stand by for years to come. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=398.26s)]
*  And I don't want to infantilize [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=400.76s)]
*  the activities of students who are engaging appropriately [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=404.14s)]
*  in difficult discourse about a really hot topic. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=408.7s)]
*  As you've covered this, what's happened to the ability for [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=413.74s)]
*  different points of view on college campuses to be expressed? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=418.74s)]
*  And there was a survey recently where students were asked about whether or not [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=422.64s)]
*  it's OK for them to shout down [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=427.04s)]
*  a speaker who had differing points of view. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think more than half, 60 some percent of the students said, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=434.0s)]
*  yeah, it's OK to do that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=437.7s)]
*  Now, explain, you know, how that happens, considering [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=439.14s)]
*  what you might have seen on campuses when you started this beat. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=444.66s)]
*  This is a difficult discussion for college campuses. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=448.2s)]
*  The way that students express themselves and call attention to things [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=451.56s)]
*  is often to disrupt an event in various ways. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=455.26s)]
*  What I think has drawn more attention in recent years is what the phenomenon [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=458.06s)]
*  you're describing, the shouting down where you can't invite a speaker at all [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=461.6s)]
*  who has a controversial view and they're able to speak. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=465.56s)]
*  I mean, we've seen several incidents along these lines. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=469.14s)]
*  And I don't know that that colleges have found clear answers around this. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=473.4s)]
*  I mean, what academics do is they policy it to death, you know? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=479.35999999999996s)]
*  And so they've tried to erect policies around this, but it is it is a phenomenon [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=483.35999999999996s)]
*  within higher education. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=487.4s)]
*  And it's something that conservatives in particular seem to get very fired up [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=488.5s)]
*  about that, that that people who have views outside of certain liberal orthodoxy [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=492.56s)]
*  can't get a fair shake in discussions on college campuses. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=497.79999999999995s)]
*  I think your mileage may vary about the veracity of that claim. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=501.44s)]
*  There are a few incidents like this every year that get a ton of attention, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=504.78s)]
*  but there are plenty of controversial lectures [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  on college campuses that you never hear about. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=511.78s)]
*  Prior to the events in Israel over the past week, there was an event at Penn [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=514.24s)]
*  Writers Gathering or Festival of some sort, and there have been fallout. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=519.9s)]
*  There has been fallout from that because it was [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=526.14s)]
*  including speakers who profess support for Palestine [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=529.9799999999999s)]
*  and were considered anti-Semitic. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=534.56s)]
*  What's what are the repercussions, whether it's the events at Penn [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=537.38s)]
*  or at Harvard or other places? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=541.2199999999999s)]
*  Are there financial consequences now? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=543.3199999999999s)]
*  But we have seen this is always a worry for college leaders [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=545.9599999999999s)]
*  that when they stick their toe in a conflict like this, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=549.78s)]
*  people are going to have a reaction as to how they have comported themselves [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=554.4599999999999s)]
*  in these public statements. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=557.7199999999999s)]
*  And I hate to keep going back to Harvard, but it is a really good example of this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=559.16s)]
*  So what happened after the conflict arose, there was a lot of pressure [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=563.76s)]
*  on Harvard to respond. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=568.3s)]
*  The president and all of the academic leadership of Harvard [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=570.3399999999999s)]
*  put out a statement that was long, but also not forceful enough [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=573.16s)]
*  in the view of many professors on the campus. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=578.9599999999999s)]
*  The professors responded with an open letter saying this is a milquetoast [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=581.86s)]
*  response and doesn't adequately condemn the actions of Hamas. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=585.54s)]
*  The president of Harvard then issues another statement [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=590.84s)]
*  that is more forceful. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=594.84s)]
*  It's getting hard to keep track of these. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=596.9s)]
*  I think he also put out a video statement point being that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=598.28s)]
*  the Wexler Foundation that has given a lot of money to Harvard over the years [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=603.5s)]
*  has said they're going to cut ties with Harvard over its response to this. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=607.08s)]
*  And it probably points to the fact that no matter how people [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=611.44s)]
*  approach this, it can be difficult to satisfy all the different constituencies [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=615.3s)]
*  on this subject. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=619.24s)]
*  So are universities then forced to start taking stands [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=620.28s)]
*  on their views on Israel and Hamas? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=625.14s)]
*  I mean, is that something that now universities have to do [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=628.0999999999999s)]
*  as almost part of the brochure? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=630.6999999999999s)]
*  What are we going to do with students on campus? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=632.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, it seems like adding a layer of complexity [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=635.88s)]
*  to what's already a difficult space for institutions to inhabit. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=640.28s)]
*  Well, I think you've hit on the central issue, which is what [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  what is the role of an institution of higher learning in weighing in [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=648.9799999999999s)]
*  on the Dove's decision, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, et cetera. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=653.64s)]
*  There are certainly a movement within higher education that [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=658.4799999999999s)]
*  colleges need to be just politically neutral on this. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=663.3399999999999s)]
*  But I think we underestimate the vast amount of pressure [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  on these institutions to say something. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=669.0799999999999s)]
*  And then when they say something, it's never enough. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=672.0s)]
*  And an interesting phenomenon that's occurred in this circumstance [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=674.88s)]
*  is that we're now even seeing college presidents going after each other [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=678.28s)]
*  about whether their statements were good enough. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=682.38s)]
*  Ben Sasse, who's the president of the University of Florida [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=684.12s)]
*  and a former United States senator from Nebraska, issued his own statement saying [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=686.64s)]
*  these weak need equivocation from my colleagues in higher education [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=692.12s)]
*  is not good enough and we need to be more forceful in our combination of Hamas. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=696.84s)]
*  So this is an interesting phenomenon within the sector [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=701.62s)]
*  where even college presidents criticizing each other. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=705.96s)]
*  I hadn't seen that before, I don't think. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=709.0600000000001s)]
*  So is there a chilling effect on the climate [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=710.86s)]
*  on college campuses if students, if professors [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=715.32s)]
*  have to figure out how to navigate these waters in addition to just being [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=719.62s)]
*  students or faculty or part of the community? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=724.02s)]
*  I think that that's always the question, right? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=727.5600000000001s)]
*  Can we talk about these issues and not [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=730.3s)]
*  in peril our futures in one way or another? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=734.1s)]
*  And I think that that's a very real concern on college campuses [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=736.24s)]
*  about speech in general. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=739.4399999999999s)]
*  I've done a ton of reporting on college professors [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=741.06s)]
*  who have been either fired, forced out, suspended or sanctioned [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=745.1s)]
*  after events related to extramural speech that they did on Twitter, etc. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=751.9399999999999s)]
*  And you will often hear them say that, you know, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=756.56s)]
*  I'm concerned that anything I say could be used against me. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=760.06s)]
*  And, you know, all you can say is that we have the First Amendment in this country. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=764.0s)]
*  We colleges need to have policies to deal with these situations as a general rule. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=769.3s)]
*  First Amendment experts will tell you that, you know, things you say [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=775.96s)]
*  on Twitter and social media are generally considered protected speech. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=779.1s)]
*  Classroom behavior is sort of a different phenomenon. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=783.1s)]
*  You cannot target a student based on race, ethnicity or religion [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=787.3s)]
*  within a public university classroom. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=791.1s)]
*  And if that happens, as has been claimed, at least at Stanford, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=794.6s)]
*  in one case is related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=799.06s)]
*  You know, that may be a tougher case for an instructor in that situation, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=803.0s)]
*  because if you're targeting students based on on on these identities, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=807.66s)]
*  that's that's a problem. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=812.9s)]
*  Tell me a little bit about, you know, we've talked a little bit about the IVs. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=814.88s)]
*  Tell me what's happening at the University of Florida. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=817.88s)]
*  Yeah, I thought this was an interesting example, because [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=820.82s)]
*  one of the things that you're hearing right now is [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=824.24s)]
*  just the degree to which this conflict has put so many people on edge at home. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=827.52s)]
*  So many people in the United States have either family connections [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=832.6800000000001s)]
*  to to folks who are in the conflict zone or or deeply held religious [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=836.82s)]
*  or political views that connect them to that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=842.14s)]
*  And so there was a vigil at the University of Florida [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=844.84s)]
*  not long after the conflict broke out. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=848.2800000000001s)]
*  And a strange misunderstanding where somebody got ill and fainted. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=851.1800000000001s)]
*  And there was a call for 911 prompted a huge stampede at this vigil. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=856.9200000000001s)]
*  People ran running. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=862.72s)]
*  I'm told that somebody dropped a water bottle and people thought [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=863.9200000000001s)]
*  it might have been a gunshot. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=867.6800000000001s)]
*  Several students were injured and taken to the hospital because of this. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=870.32s)]
*  It's lucky it wasn't worse. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=873.64s)]
*  This was a big space where people could could get out [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=875.6800000000001s)]
*  and I think exit fairly well, even though they were running. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=878.6800000000001s)]
*  But you can imagine this could have been a profound tragedy. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=881.48s)]
*  And I think it is something that college leaders across the country [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=884.14s)]
*  paid attention to because it really shows just what a highly volatile [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=888.6800000000001s)]
*  situation this is when you have people in large groups [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=893.98s)]
*  gathered around at a tense moment like this. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=896.64s)]
*  Where do we go from here? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=899.48s)]
*  I mean, how do college campuses, how do students and faculty navigate, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=900.64s)]
*  you know, taking positions or biting their tongue [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=905.72s)]
*  about the issues of the day, especially ones that are so sensitive and personal? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, the answer for higher education cannot be that everybody should shut up. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=916.42s)]
*  That can't be the answer. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=920.22s)]
*  That would be completely antithetical to what higher education [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=921.8199999999999s)]
*  in this country is meant to stand for. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=925.98s)]
*  So that's not an option. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=927.68s)]
*  So the only other option is to find [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=929.08s)]
*  safe and civil places for this type of dialogue to emerge, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=933.32s)]
*  to allow for the free exchange of ideas and to allow for protest. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=936.72s)]
*  And colleges are going to have to navigate that. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  The good thing for them is they have a heck of a lot of practice. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=944.5600000000001s)]
*  This has been the nagging issue, I would say, certainly of the last decade [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=947.96s)]
*  for college and university leaders. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=953.1600000000001s)]
*  And I think that these institutions are very much primed for this. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=955.12s)]
*  It would be a a dark day if students and faculty felt [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rpfc7TyLOQM&t=961.0200000000001s)]
