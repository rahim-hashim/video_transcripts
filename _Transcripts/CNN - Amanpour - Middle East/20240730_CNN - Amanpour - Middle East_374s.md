# “What We Saw Was Unspeakable:" U.S. Doctors on What They Witnessed in Gaza | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM)
*  Well, this spring, two American doctors made the treacherous journey into Gaza to try and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=0.0s)]
*  offer their services in this desperate situation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  But what they found was far worse than they had expected. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=7.36s)]
*  As they recently wrote for Politico, what we saw was unspeakable. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=11.0s)]
*  Doctors Mark Pulmutter and Feroz Sidwab joined the program to relay what they witnessed and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=15.4s)]
*  the urgent need for an end to the violence. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Doctors, welcome to the program. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=23.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking the time. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=25.16s)]
*  We should note that both of you volunteered at the Gaza European Hospital in Chanyounas [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=27.32s)]
*  for two weeks at the end of March into early April and have a combined 57 years of volunteering [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  in disaster and war zones. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=36.92s)]
*  So we should commend you for your humanitarian aid all of these years, especially now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=39.24s)]
*  Let me start with you, Dr. Pulmutter. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=44.92s)]
*  What surprised you most or stood out to you in terms of what you saw during your time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=47.28s)]
*  there in Gaza? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, retrospectively, what surprised me most was not the anticipated effect of a 2000-pound [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=55.96s)]
*  or 500-pound American bomb being dropped on a tent city, bombs that were designed for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=62.56s)]
*  a busing bunkers in Afghanistan, but rather how the carnage that was induced really focused [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=67.84s)]
*  on children, health care workers, and journalists. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=75.0s)]
*  Those that were the most innocent, those that provided care, and those that would report [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=79.88s)]
*  to the world the accuracy of the carnage were specifically targeted. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=83.72s)]
*  When you say specifically targeted, can you go into more detail what you mean by that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=90.4s)]
*  Sure, absolutely. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=96.0s)]
*  We found children, many workers found children, not just myself, that had high-velocity bullet [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  wounds, sniper bullet wounds, rifle wounds, that were dead center in the chest. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=103.0s)]
*  I mentioned to other reporters that I couldn't put my stethoscope more dead center over a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=108.44s)]
*  heart than the entrance bullet hole was. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=113.32s)]
*  There was no back to these children. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=117.52s)]
*  The bullet had removed their entire torso. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=118.88s)]
*  There was a similar bullet hole in two of the children's temples, so they were shot [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=123.72s)]
*  twice. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=130.4s)]
*  Once was certainly a kill shot. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  The second one was when they were on the ground. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=135.4s)]
*  No sniper hits a child, and I'm talking toddlers, twice by mistake. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=139.04s)]
*  That finding was duplicated by many health care workers, that children were specifically [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  targeted by high-velocity rifle bullet wounds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  Then there was a plethora of health care workers with horrible stories of being specifically [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=155.6s)]
*  targeted. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  Then, of course, journalists were either assassinated, not allowed back into the country, or had [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  their equipment destroyed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=168.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=169.86s)]
*  And as you would imagine, that's quite an extreme allegation to make that these civilians [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=170.86s)]
*  were indeed targeted. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=176.94s)]
*  These are allegations that you made in a CBS News interview. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=179.66s)]
*  And an IDF spokesperson in response to that said that the IDF has never and will never [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=183.82s)]
*  deliberately target children. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=189.18s)]
*  The IDF stressed that it calls and acts for the evacuation for civilians from combat zones. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=190.74s)]
*  And, of course, CNN cannot independently verify any of these allegations that you've just [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=198.66s)]
*  made. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=203.7s)]
*  Dr. Sidhuah, let me ask you just about the context of children being the majority of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=204.7s)]
*  those who are suffering here. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  UNICEF calls Gaza the world's most dangerous place to be a child. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=214.02s)]
*  They make up 90 percent of those seen in the ER there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=217.38s)]
*  Tell us specifically about nine-year-old Juri, who you treated. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=227.18s)]
*  Juri, yeah, like you mentioned, she's a nine-year-old girl. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=228.18s)]
*  She along with her family evacuated from Khan Yunus to Ra'afah under threat. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=232.66s)]
*  And when they got to Ra'afah, went to her grandparents' house. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=237.82s)]
*  That home was bombed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=241.3s)]
*  Her grandparents were killed. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=244.38s)]
*  Some of her siblings were killed, and the rest were previously injured. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=246.1s)]
*  We found her in the preoperative area, actually at European Hospital, purely by accident. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  The wounds she had, I don't want to go into the details on the air. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=255.29999999999998s)]
*  Maybe if people want to see pictures and read the details, they can read that political [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=258.34s)]
*  article. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=262.86s)]
*  But the wounds she had... [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=263.86s)]
*  We're showing Dr. Sidhuah some of the photos that you provided. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=264.86s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=266.86s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=267.86s)]
*  The wounds were just horrific. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=268.86s)]
*  It's not something that anybody can actually fully recover from, even if she does manage [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=271.74s)]
*  to survive. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=276.02s)]
*  And she's thankfully in Egypt now. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=277.02s)]
*  Even if she does manage to survive, she's going to be permanently disabled for the rest [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=278.3s)]
*  of her life. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  And she's just one of thousands and thousands of kids who are hurt this way. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=284.74s)]
*  With the health care system under attack and with the health care needs of the population [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=291.5s)]
*  so dramatically increased from what any system really could provide, these children don't [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=295.98s)]
*  have much of a chance. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=301.98s)]
*  So we should note, you just said the health care system under attack. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=302.98s)]
*  I do want to ask you about the lack of resources there that you and other doctors have claimed [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=306.94000000000005s)]
*  is non-existent at this point. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=314.1s)]
*  The Israeli officials say they've allowed the delivery of more than 600,000 tons of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=315.9s)]
*  food and supplies. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=320.06s)]
*  Dr. Perlmutter, when you hear those numbers and counter them with what you actually see [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=322.02s)]
*  on the ground, where is the disconnect? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=327.34000000000003s)]
*  Are these supplies just not getting to where they need to go? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=330.9s)]
*  Well, I think they're being as dishonest as Netanyahu was when he spoke to our Congress. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=333.46s)]
*  When we were there, we ran out of the supplies that we had brought within our first week. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=339.65999999999997s)]
*  I personally brought 700 pounds of orthopedic supplies and dressing changes. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=344.7s)]
*  And Dr. Sidra brought even more. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  And there were no supplies when we got there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=353.14s)]
*  The supplies that we bought were exhausted by the end of our first week. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA7MeI65IlM&t=355.7s)]
