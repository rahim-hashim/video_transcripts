Video Description: The United Nations Humanitarian Chief, Martin Griffiths, says "life is draining out of Gaza at a terrifying speed." More than 100 people have been killed while gathering around food aid trucks in Gaza City, according to the Ministry of Health there.The timeline is under dispute, but Israeli forces say they did open fire. A local journalist who witnessed the incident told CNN that Israeli fire prompted a deadly stampede that left hundreds injured as aid trucks and people fled the scene. An Israeli official confirmed IDF troops did use live fire, saying that the crowd "posed a threat" to troops. This comes in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the U.N. says over half a million people are "one step away from famine." Mark Regev is special adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and he joins the show from Tel Aviv.

*  nothing to do with it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=32.04s)]
*  Do you know who it was? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=32.98s)]

*  northern Gaza Strip. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=48.64s)]
*  And this shows that Israel is [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=50.34s)]
*  interested in seeing aid and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=52.980000000000004s)]

*  mass casualty tragedy where it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=61.18s)]
*  looked like the civilians were [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=65.12s)]
*  storming the trucks trying to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=66.88s)]

*  desperation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=72.98s)]
*  And people, a crowd was pushing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=74.22s)]
*  and shoving and people were [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=78.68s)]
*  killed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=80.02000000000001s)]
*  I can't tell you the exact [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=80.28s)]
*  numbers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=81.22s)]
*  I don't, as you know, don't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  trust the numbers put out by the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=83.38s)]
*  Hamas-controlled Ministry of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=84.52000000000001s)]
*  Health in Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=85.68s)]
*  There were reports that maybe [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=86.78s)]
*  their drivers were driving over [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=88.28s)]
*  parts of the crowd. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=90.18s)]
*  It appears to be a tragedy, but [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=91.44s)]
*  I can tell you Israel was not [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=93.58s)]
*  involved directly in any way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=94.78s)]
*  When you say not involved [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  directly in any way, what do you [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=99.04s)]
*  mean? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=100.54s)]
*  I mean, you enabled this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=100.88s)]
*  convoy, this convoy, as you [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=102.68s)]
*  said, and your forces are there [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=104.08s)]
*  on the ground and open fire. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=106.34s)]
*  They said it themselves. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=107.72s)]
*  What does that mean, not [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=108.78s)]
*  involved in any way? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=109.58s)]
*  So, this was, well, we allowed [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=112.14s)]
*  the aid to come in. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=114.54s)]
*  We were involved that way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=115.34s)]
*  That's our policy, to allow food [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=116.74s)]
*  to go into Gaza for the civilian [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=118.24s)]
*  population. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  But in the incident of people [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=120.83999999999999s)]
*  storming the trucks and the way [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  the truck drivers bade and people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=123.44s)]
*  getting squashed and pressed and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  apparently there being mass [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=127.5s)]
*  casualties, Israel was not there [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=129.34s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=131.18s)]
*  OK, but they did open fire and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=133.28s)]
*  people were killed. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=135.94s)]
*  So I'm completely confused by [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=136.7s)]
*  what you're saying because they [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=138.28s)]
*  admitted, the IDF spokesman said [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=139.64s)]
*  it, said it on our air, that they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=141.94s)]
*  open fire. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=144.48s)]
*  That's a separate incident, not [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=145.38s)]
*  connected to the tragedy with the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=149.24s)]
*  trucks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=150.64s)]
*  That was different place, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=151.64s)]
*  different time in the general [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=154.01999999999998s)]
*  location, but not the same [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=156.01999999999998s)]
*  incident at all. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=157.32s)]
*  And I have to tell you that we [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=158.51999999999998s)]
*  are not aware that the IDF fired [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=160.64s)]
*  caused casualties at all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=163.22s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=166.12s)]
*  journalist who CNN works with on [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  the ground has a different view [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=168.78s)]
*  of it, but maybe there were [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=170.84s)]
*  other incidents. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=171.72s)]
*  That, obviously, you say is [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  under review and we will hope to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=175.24s)]
*  get further clarification. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=176.8s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=178.78s)]
*  So Israel is the only force in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=179.64000000000001s)]
*  charge of security by your own [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=184.74s)]
*  announcements, by your own [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  volition, by your own actions [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=188.0s)]
*  over the last, you know, five [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=190.58s)]
*  months or so there. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=191.94s)]
*  It is, as everybody is saying, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=193.34s)]
*  Israel's responsibility, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=195.24s)]
*  therefore, if you let these [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=196.94s)]
*  trucks in to provide security. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=198.70000000000002s)]
*  And this obviously comes in the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  context of so little food going [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=203.78s)]
*  in that people are desperate, as [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=207.08s)]
*  we've heard from the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=209.24s)]
*  international forces. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  So, first, aren't you the only [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=211.14000000000001s)]
*  law enforcement people in the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=213.62s)]
*  Gaza Strip right now? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=215.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, Hamas has not yet [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=218.98s)]
*  been completely destroyed, and I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=220.78s)]
*  should have been clearer. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=222.38s)]
*  In the first incident of the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=223.62s)]
*  truck being swamped by [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=226.12s)]
*  civilians, there was gunfire, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=227.88s)]
*  but it wasn't Israeli forces. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=230.58s)]
*  There weren't Israeli forces on [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=231.98s)]
*  the trucks or around the trucks. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=233.12s)]
*  That was Palestinian armed [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=234.78s)]
*  groups. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=236.88s)]
*  We don't know if it was Hamas or [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=237.58s)]
*  other armed groups, but there [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=238.98000000000002s)]
*  definitely was fire. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=240.02s)]
*  That we do know. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=241.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=243.02s)]
*  So my question again is, Israel [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  is the only law enforcement [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=247.06s)]
*  operation on the ground as you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=249.16s)]
*  wage this war. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=251.22s)]
*  Therefore, if you allow these [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=252.72s)]
*  trucks in, who do you expect to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=255.72s)]
*  provide the security for them? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=259.16s)]
*  Because every convoy needs [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=260.42s)]
*  security. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=262.16s)]
*  I mean, I've covered this from, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=262.58s)]
*  you know, time immemorial back [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=264.08s)]
*  from Bosnia to Somalia and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=265.74s)]
*  elsewhere. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  It all requires discipline, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=267.47999999999996s)]
*  organization, and coordination, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=268.94s)]
*  and security. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=271.68s)]
*  Who do you think should have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=273.88s)]
*  been responsible for security in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=275.14s)]
*  the convoy that you allowed in? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  So, it's a difficult question, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=280.74s)]
*  and we're grappling with it, and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=283.12s)]
*  we're talking to the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=284.82s)]
*  international community, to the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=286.34s)]
*  aid organizations, to the United [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=287.84s)]
*  Nations, to other partners who [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=289.28s)]
*  are relevant in this [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=291.22s)]
*  conversation, because of course [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=292.12s)]
*  we want to see the aid safely [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=293.38000000000005s)]
*  reach the people. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=295.82000000000005s)]
*  Now, it's quite possible, as you [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  know, Hamas has been stealing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=299.38000000000005s)]
*  aid. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=300.92s)]
*  That's been documented. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  We've heard people in Gaza [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  complain about this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=303.38000000000005s)]
*  So is it possible that people in [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=304.72s)]
*  Gaza don't trust that this aid [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  that the international community [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=309.82000000000005s)]
*  is giving to the people of Gaza [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=311.48s)]
*  is actually reaching the people [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  of Gaza and not being siphoned [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=313.92s)]
*  off by the terrorists? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=315.72s)]
*  That could be one of the reasons [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=316.58000000000004s)]
*  to explain what's going on. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1gR6RGGkfg&t=317.98s)]
