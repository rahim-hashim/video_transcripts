Video Description: Trump is banking on rich Arab countries and kingdoms to support and implement his vision. Qatar, the main regional mediator, has already said it plans to help rebuild Gaza — while the Palestinians remain on their land. The United States wants normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but the Saudi foreign minister has also rejected the Trump plan. Former Saudi Intelligence Chief and former Ambassador to the United States Turki Al Faisal joins Christiane from the capital, Riyadh.

# Fmr. Head of Saudi Arabian Intelligence Reacts to Trump's Proposal for Gaza | Amanpour and Company
**CNN - Amanpour - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4)
*  Prince Turki, welcome to the program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=0.0s)]
*  You have been digesting [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=2.44s)]
*  what came from the White House last night. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=4.74s)]
*  You probably heard the view from Ramallah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=7.04s)]
*  So, is there going to be a united Arab front [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  against this Trump vision? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=14.08s)]
*  Thank you, Ms. Amapour, for inviting me. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  After hearing Mr. Barghouti, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=20.28s)]
*  I really don't know what to add to what he said, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=22.96s)]
*  other than to say that what came out of Mr. Trump [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=25.92s)]
*  is not digestible. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=29.06s)]
*  I respectfully decline to add more disrespectful comments [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=31.02s)]
*  to that, but it is a fantasy to think [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=35.26s)]
*  that ethnic cleansing in the 21st century [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=40.1s)]
*  can be condoned by a world community [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=43.9s)]
*  that stays on its behind and does not respond to that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=47.18s)]
*  The problem in Palestine is not the Palestinians. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=51.379999999999995s)]
*  It is the Israeli occupation, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=55.82s)]
*  and this has been clear and understood by everybody. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Hence, you have United Nations resolutions [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=63.06s)]
*  calling for the quid pro quo of land for peace [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=66.46s)]
*  from 1967 until now. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=71.1s)]
*  The Arab Peace Initiative, of course, is based on that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=73.9s)]
*  and offered Israel not only diplomatic relation, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=76.94s)]
*  but all of the things that Israel wanted, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=79.9s)]
*  from trade, from normalization, etc., [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=83.38s)]
*  and return for the establishment of a Palestinian state [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=87.64s)]
*  with its capital in East Jerusalem. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=91.08s)]
*  All of these things were American policy [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=93.34s)]
*  until this latest wording that Mr. Trump has chosen to use [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=97.04s)]
*  in claiming that he wants to better things [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=102.06s)]
*  when actually it is going to turn things [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=107.92s)]
*  into more conflict and more bloodshed. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  Can I draw on your long, long years of experience? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=112.76s)]
*  You were Saudi ambassador to America. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=118.22s)]
*  What would you be telling your capital, your king, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=120.36s)]
*  in a cable, had you been in Washington last night [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=123.66s)]
*  in that position and listened to what came from the podium? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=127.64s)]
*  What would you, how would you have explained it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=130.74s)]
*  Well, I can tell you I'm glad I am not in that position [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=133.5s)]
*  because there is no way that I can explain it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=137.34s)]
*  It comes out of the blue and it is totally based on, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=140.72s)]
*  as Mr. Barhouti said, on the Israeli position [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=145.5s)]
*  of ethnic cleansing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=149.16s)]
*  As you mentioned yourself, Mr. Ben-Gavir, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=151.78s)]
*  who is the ultimate ethnic cleanser in Palestine, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=155.28s)]
*  he's been saying this for the last two and a half years [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=159.28s)]
*  since he joined the government. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=162.12s)]
*  And now he's justifying what he said [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=163.95999999999998s)]
*  by the words of the American president. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=166.92s)]
*  That is unacceptable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  So what then is the next step? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  We've had everybody from your capital [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=174.42000000000002s)]
*  to the neighboring countries, which Trump expects to take, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=177.02s)]
*  these millions of Palestinians reject this out of hand, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=180.22000000000003s)]
*  say that it's illegal. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  We've heard the president of the Palestinian Authority. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=184.9s)]
*  What do you think is the next step? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=188.0s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=190.9s)]
*  I'm not in government, so I don't know [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=193.3s)]
*  what my government will propose. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=195.3s)]
*  But I would expect that there will be a change [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=196.98000000000002s)]
*  that there will be collective action on the part [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=200.06s)]
*  not only of the Arab but Muslim world as well, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=202.54s)]
*  along with Europeans and other countries [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  that believe in the two-state solution [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=207.98s)]
*  to take up the matter and where else [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  but go to the United Nations. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=212.78s)]
*  And this is the only arena where things like that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=214.88s)]
*  can be discussed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=218.48s)]
*  Unfortunately, with the American veto, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  I cannot expect that there will be much success [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  in passing any resolutions. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  But nonetheless, it will show that the world is opposed [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=226.38s)]
*  to this mad ethnic cleansing plan [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=230.48s)]
*  that the American president has proposed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=234.82s)]
*  You're a really smart person and understands, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=238.48s)]
*  you know, sometimes things are said [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=243.32s)]
*  and they may hide a different meaning. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=245.66s)]
*  Do you see any, is there any negotiating strategy here [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=247.72s)]
*  that you see that Trump might claim [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=253.52s)]
*  or his acolytes might claim? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  I have no idea and I cannot see anything [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=257.16s)]
*  other than a blank wall in front of me [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=260.16s)]
*  of total acceptance of the Israeli position [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=263.90000000000003s)]
*  by the American government. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=268.24s)]
*  It's not only the president. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=270.32s)]
*  We've heard also supporting calls from senators [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=272.04s)]
*  and congressmen and other of the American strata [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=275.8s)]
*  of politics supporting this call. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=279.6s)]
*  So that is the unfortunate position of a whole structure [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=282.44s)]
*  that has been built in the past years [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=288.28s)]
*  in support of Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=290.7s)]
*  As you know, and as we've said, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=294.6s)]
*  normalization is a big strategy, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=296.68s)]
*  a big goal of the United States, of Israel, et cetera. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=300.12s)]
*  Certain Arab countries have always done that, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=304.28s)]
*  but the crown jewel is your country, Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=306.2s)]
*  Do you see any way, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=310.48s)]
*  I know you're not in government, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=311.68s)]
*  but your king and others have said in the past [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=313.28000000000003s)]
*  that there will be no normalization [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=317.2s)]
*  without a pledge for a Palestinian state [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=318.86s)]
*  and in fact for Israel to get out of Gaza. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=321.44s)]
*  Do you think that still holds? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=324.0s)]
*  Can you see normalization happening? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=327.0s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=328.76s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=331.48s)]
*  This morning our foreign ministry issued a statement [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=332.68s)]
*  rejecting what came out of Washington in the last days. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=336.06s)]
*  This has been the position of Saudi Arabia [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=340.96s)]
*  from the beginning and even before October 7th, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=343.2s)]
*  if you recall, when Prince Mohammed spoke [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=347.76s)]
*  with one of the opposition television channels in America. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=350.8s)]
*  He made clear then that the path to a clear Palestinian state [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=356.48s)]
*  is what we want to see as a result of any talks [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=361.8s)]
*  that we have with the Americans. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqGRjiSnoO4&t=365.54s)]
