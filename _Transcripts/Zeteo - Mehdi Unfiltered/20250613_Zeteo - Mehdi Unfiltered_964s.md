Video Description: “There’s nothing I’ve seen here that is close to other conflict zones.”
From a tent in Gaza, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss what’s happening on the ground — as Israel starves Palestinians and pushes a deadly, US-backed ‘aid plan’ following an 80-day food blockade.
Mehdi asks Elder about Israeli claims that Hamas has been diverting aid away from the United Nations. Elder pushes back: “When it comes to Hamas aid diversion, show us the proof. It doesn’t exist,” he says.

# DEBUNKING Netanyahu’s Claim That Hamas Takes Aid
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg)
*  After a devastating Israeli blockade on food into Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=0.0s)]
*  that has become one of the world's worst hunger crises, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  a new Israeli-backed food distribution site [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=6.04s)]
*  has become the scene of a series of massacres [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=8.52s)]
*  by that country's military. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=10.96s)]
*  In just the first three days since the food distribution site opened, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=12.44s)]
*  Israeli forces killed dozens and dozens of people [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=15.56s)]
*  and injured many more. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  The military told the New York Times in a statement on Tuesday [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=19.8s)]
*  that those who were killed allegedly strayed from the designated route [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=22.12s)]
*  to the site and failed to respond to warning shots, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=25.6s)]
*  calling them suspects who posed a threat to soldiers. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=28.16s)]
*  In their reporting, the Times interviewed Dr Ahmed al-Farrah, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=31.16s)]
*  a senior official at Nasser Hospital in Qamunis, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=34.08s)]
*  who said most of the victims brought in [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=36.56s)]
*  were children between the ages of 10 and 13 [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=38.72s)]
*  and that many of them were admitted to the hospital [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=41.36s)]
*  with gunshot wounds to their heads or chests. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=43.56s)]
*  United Nations has spoken out against the food distribution site, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=47.64s)]
*  saying it requires civilians to walk for miles [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=50.36s)]
*  near Israeli military lines to access food [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=52.96s)]
*  and could ultimately lead to the displacement [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=56.04s)]
*  of those who live in northern Gaza. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=57.96s)]
*  James Elder, spokesman for UNICEF, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=59.92s)]
*  the United Nations Children's Fund, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=62.04s)]
*  is on the ground in Gaza, and I spoke to him earlier. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=64.32s)]
*  James Elder, let me begin by asking you, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=67.2s)]
*  what is your response? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=69.52s)]
*  I know you've just arrived back in Gaza for your fifth visit there [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=70.76s)]
*  since October the 7th, 2023. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  What is your response to the recent mass killings [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=76.4s)]
*  that we have seen of hungry guards [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  and trying to get aid from the quote-unquote [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation food distribution site? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=83.68s)]
*  Yeah, Matty, unfortunately, we made it clear a month ago [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=88.56s)]
*  when we first heard of this foundation that it will not work. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=90.8s)]
*  It won't work in principle because humanitarian aid [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=93.92s)]
*  is about taking it to where people need it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=96.04s)]
*  You do not make a mother walk 15 kilometres [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=98.04s)]
*  or a grandmother or someone with an amputation. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=100.8s)]
*  Don't do those things, you know. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=103.32s)]
*  During the ceasefire, there were 400 distribution points. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=104.88s)]
*  400, that's what humanitarian aid is. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=107.48s)]
*  This was never designed to work, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=110.4s)]
*  but there was an additional danger in politicising [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  and militarising aid, which was when you take people [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=115.72000000000001s)]
*  into a combat site, you may well have incidents like this. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  We've now seen, as you say, two mass tickers. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=121.64000000000001s)]
*  So it's what was warned, not only because this veneer of aid [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  is also preventing what people really need, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=128.52s)]
*  which is to flood the Gaza Strip through UN agencies [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=130.88s)]
*  and our brave Palestinian organisations on the ground. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=133.52s)]
*  So it's not doing that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=136.44s)]
*  It's a distraction. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  And meanwhile, people are going there after a massacre, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=139.04000000000002s)]
*  and they're returning because they're so desperate for food, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=141.95999999999998s)]
*  knowing there's been a massacre, and then today it's closed. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=144.32s)]
*  So it's a disaster that we all saw happening, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=147.0s)]
*  but they are pushing ahead with it [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=150.32s)]
*  instead of sustained, neutral, impartial humanitarian aid [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=152.27999999999997s)]
*  to where people need it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  They say, of course, the Israelis, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=158.72s)]
*  that they are doing it this way, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  when the Americans say they're doing it this way, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=162.04s)]
*  because Hamas takes all the aid from the UN. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=164.04s)]
*  As someone who's been there several times [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  over the last year and a half, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=168.6s)]
*  what's been your experience in terms of aid being diverted away [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=169.72s)]
*  from people who need it, UN aid? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  It's a very, very frustrating statement. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=175.48000000000002s)]
*  We hear it time and again. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=178.0s)]
*  In the most simple sense, it shows the evidence. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=179.28s)]
*  That's it shows the evidence, which has not been done, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  which has also not been done when you heard from senior, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=184.44s)]
*  Biden's former ambassador on humanitarian affairs this week, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  speaking exactly to that, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=190.8s)]
*  that he had not had that evidence shared. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=192.16s)]
*  So we face statements time and again designed to discredit [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  tried and tested aid systems, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  and then to allow and justify weaponising aid, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  which is, of course, designed to force a population, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=202.84s)]
*  use aid as a bait, force that population. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=205.96s)]
*  So, Mehdi, when it comes to aid diversion, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=208.92s)]
*  show us the evidence there is none. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=211.76s)]
*  UNICEF, we're a last mile deliverer. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=213.12s)]
*  We get food to a child. We don't use third parties. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=216.72s)]
*  We have monitoring systems that are exhaustive. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=219.6s)]
*  This is not the first place that you've worked in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=222.12s)]
*  without a great degree of governance. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=223.64s)]
*  This is what the United Nations does. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=225.24s)]
*  Then you could talk about looting. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=227.12s)]
*  The United Nations has been very clear. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=228.92s)]
*  When you deny a population for 70 days anything, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=230.51999999999998s)]
*  it's economics. It's the economics of scarcity. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  People will take what they can [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=236.44s)]
*  when they are absolutely desperate. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=238.76s)]
*  During the ceasefire, there was no looting [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=240.64s)]
*  because we were able to flood the Gaza Strip with aid [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=242.76s)]
*  as any normal place would be. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=245.12s)]
*  When we are allowed a handful of trucks [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=247.4s)]
*  after 70 days of nothing coming into the Gaza Strip, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=249.32s)]
*  except for bombs, nothing, and then we're given one route, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=252.48s)]
*  this is a designed system to enable looting. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=256.12s)]
*  So looting happens with everyday people, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=259.56s)]
*  not when we're allowed a lot of aid. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=262.12s)]
*  And yes, when it comes to Hamas aid diversion, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=263.84s)]
*  show us the proof it doesn't exist. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=267.88s)]
*  On Twitter, Philip Lazzarini, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=270.36s)]
*  the UNRWA commissioner general, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=271.92s)]
*  wrote that aid distribution in Gaza has become a death trap. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=274.04s)]
*  Is that UNICEF's experience of what's going on, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=278.08s)]
*  assessment of what's going on as well? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=281.04s)]
*  Not when it's done well. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=283.88s)]
*  When we're allowed to save lives, that's what the UN does. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=285.88s)]
*  So during the ceasefire, again, two months, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=288.68s)]
*  hostages went home, 500 trucks a day, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=291.28s)]
*  malnutrition rates down, disease rates down, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=294.08s)]
*  levels of water up, you know, we know what to do. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=297.84s)]
*  We have incredible partners on the ground. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=300.48s)]
*  But right now, James, under this quote-unquote [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=302.28s)]
*  Gaza humanitarian foundation, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=303.48s)]
*  is aid now a death trap for Gazans? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=304.92s)]
*  So you never miss a video or live show. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=312.88s)]
*  But if you want early access to exclusive content, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=315.08s)]
*  then you have to head to zateo.com and subscribe now. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=317.68s)]
*  You'll be supporting fearless, independent journalism. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=321.32s)]
*  Yes, we warned that four weeks ago [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=324.92s)]
*  before this thing even started. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=326.6s)]
*  Absolutely, you are giving people a choice, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=328.04s)]
*  either deprivation or the risk of death. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=331.08s)]
*  This is something we said publicly four weeks ago [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=333.96s)]
*  before it was up and running, before these two massacres. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=336.84s)]
*  So yes, absolutely, it's a veneer of aid. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=339.56s)]
*  It's not an aid mechanism, of course, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=342.84s)]
*  because it's men with guns giving out food. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=345.4s)]
*  Most critically, it's a distraction to... [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  Firstly, I think, to stop people focusing on the horrors here. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=351.32s)]
*  But we've seen many, we've seen increasing pressure [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=356.28s)]
*  from Western governments around what's happening here in Gaza. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=358.68s)]
*  And this veneer of aid is trying to loosen that pressure [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=363.76s)]
*  so that this carnage of children can continue. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=367.36s)]
*  You are the UNICEF, you are the UN Children's Fund, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=371.76000000000005s)]
*  you deal with children specifically. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=375.6s)]
*  UNICEF recently reported that since the ceasefire ended on March 18, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=377.64000000000004s)]
*  over 1,300 children have been killed in Gaza, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=381.88000000000005s)]
*  more than 3,700 injured. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=384.6s)]
*  That's more than a dozen kids killed every day [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  since Israel terminated the ceasefire. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=389.64000000000004s)]
*  How does the number of kids killed in Gaza, the rate of killing? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  Because we had a big debate about the death toll [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=397.64000000000004s)]
*  and can you trust Hamas figures, et cetera. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=399.64000000000004s)]
*  From your perspective, as someone who's deployed [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=401.64s)]
*  to multiple war zones, humanitarian crises, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=403.88s)]
*  how does the rate of kids being killed in Gaza right now [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=407.2s)]
*  compare to other places you've served? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=409.88s)]
*  Unprecedented, not only where I've served, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=413.08s)]
*  anyone who's served anywhere in living memory. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=415.12s)]
*  17,000 children killed in the entire, in just 20 months. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=419.4s)]
*  As you say, it's now since the ceasefire, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=424.36s)]
*  2,000 girls and boys, we've restarted the clock. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=426.44s)]
*  In 20 months, and we know why, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=431.40000000000003s)]
*  because this level of indiscriminate attacks [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=433.40000000000003s)]
*  has led to an unprecedented number of girls and boys being killed [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=436.96000000000004s)]
*  and around 50,000 killed or injured. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=441.88s)]
*  The level of maiming media... [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=445.16s)]
*  When I first came to Gaza, I encountered a young child [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=447.36s)]
*  who had all the wounds of war, the shrapnel, the burns, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=450.56s)]
*  the fourth-degree burns, I'd never encountered that before. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=453.44s)]
*  But the little child, little boy, Mohammed, nine years old, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  I picture him very clearly, he gave me this little thumbs up. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=458.84000000000003s)]
*  It was a remarkable, unsolicited act. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=461.64s)]
*  Wow, you're a special kid through all the horrors [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=463.72s)]
*  that your body's enduring. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=466.28000000000003s)]
*  You're going to be OK. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=467.8s)]
*  Then I was told that his entire family, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=469.72s)]
*  his mum, his dad, his brothers, his sisters, grandparents, everyone, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=472.12s)]
*  you've all heard it, everyone is being killed. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=475.2s)]
*  I never thought I'd hear that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=477.16s)]
*  I've heard it dozens of times, it's no longer unique. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=479.32s)]
*  I've heard it today, I've only been back in Daraa for a day. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=481.24s)]
*  This level of indiscriminate attack has led us to, yes, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=485.36s)]
*  to answer your question, levels we have never, ever seen before. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  You know, Mehdi, I've done this for a couple of decades now, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=493.15999999999997s)]
*  and it used to be quite simple for you to say, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=496.04s)]
*  if we advocate the children for their rights, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=497.84s)]
*  they're in a classroom, they get fed, they get protected. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=500.36s)]
*  I've stood in Gaza previously and thought, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=503.68s)]
*  wow, this is the first time I need to advocate [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=506.12s)]
*  that these children are children. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=508.8s)]
*  There's something deeply wrong here. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=510.92s)]
*  There's something deeply wrong. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=513.68s)]
*  Are things changing, James? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=514.8s)]
*  Last month we saw the UK, France, Canada issue a joint statement [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=516.3199999999999s)]
*  calling the level of human suffering in Gaza intolerable. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=519.7199999999999s)]
*  They called Israel's basic quantity of food [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=522.52s)]
*  into the region wholly inadequate. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=524.5999999999999s)]
*  This week, Keir Starmer, Prime Minister of the UK, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=526.28s)]
*  says that Israel's actions right now are appalling, he said. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=528.64s)]
*  Do you think world leaders, Western leaders, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=531.7199999999999s)]
*  are starting to wake up to what you've been seeing on the ground [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=533.4s)]
*  for the last 20 months? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=535.92s)]
*  I have to paraphrase everyone I see here, Mehdi. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=538.8s)]
*  The sense is hope. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=540.7199999999999s)]
*  Every time they see statements like that, or hear it, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  people here are very connected, as you know. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=544.0s)]
*  This is a literacy rate, which is the pride of a region. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  Every time they hear of a ceasefire, you feel it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=550.2800000000001s)]
*  It's visceral. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=552.44s)]
*  You feel, sorry, just drones, bombs. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=553.2800000000001s)]
*  You feel that. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=556.6s)]
*  People feel that level of hope, but in the same way, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=557.72s)]
*  it's crushed when nothing happens. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=561.0400000000001s)]
*  So they hear these statements, but they know [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=562.76s)]
*  these world leaders have more in their arsenal [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=566.0s)]
*  beyond statements, and that's what we need to see. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=567.9200000000001s)]
*  We need to see very clear impact. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=570.24s)]
*  This is not a tragedy. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=572.08s)]
*  This is one that's being slowly excused away [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=574.64s)]
*  and the world's starting to learn with it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=577.16s)]
*  We cannot get to a point and say, well, never again. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=578.64s)]
*  It's happening right now. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=581.8s)]
*  Let's stop it now. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=582.88s)]
*  Let's finally get to a point where the world [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  no longer watches a type of warfare [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=587.24s)]
*  that has absolutely no respect for international law, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=589.52s)]
*  no respect for civilians. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=592.9599999999999s)]
*  How worried are you about your own safety, James? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=595.28s)]
*  You mentioned drones hovering above. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=597.12s)]
*  We've seen a record number of UN employees killed in Gaza [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=599.4s)]
*  since October the 7th. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=604.16s)]
*  How worried are you about your safety, your colleague's safety? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=605.84s)]
*  Philip Lazzarini, the UNRWA commissioner, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=611.16s)]
*  recently said that the UN worker who was killed [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=613.12s)]
*  in that massacre of paramedics a few months ago, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=616.32s)]
*  apparently, according to the investigation, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=619.12s)]
*  he was killed by a blow to the back of his head, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=621.4s)]
*  not by some random accidental shooting. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=623.36s)]
*  Maybe, we don't know the details, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=626.36s)]
*  but killed with a sharp blow to the head. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=628.56s)]
*  How worried are you, even though you're standing there [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=630.12s)]
*  talking to me in a UNICEF jacket, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=632.16s)]
*  that you're not safe either in Gaza? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=633.92s)]
*  Maybe, it would be naive of me to say there's no concern, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=636.6s)]
*  because it's UNICEF that's made very clear [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=639.24s)]
*  since the start of this war that there is nowhere safe. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=641.12s)]
*  And we mean that very, very, very clearly. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=643.24s)]
*  We've seen time and again people take into safe zones, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  no food, no water, no medicine. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=648.0s)]
*  That's the liberal definition of safe, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=649.24s)]
*  but they've been bombed in safe zones. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=650.72s)]
*  You sleep here at night, you have no military background. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=652.68s)]
*  I start to hear, oh, that's about 500 meters away, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=655.56s)]
*  that's about 600 meters away. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=658.12s)]
*  Your windows shake, the things you see, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=659.96s)]
*  I'll never erase from my mind, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=662.32s)]
*  but I get to leave this place, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=663.8s)]
*  and there is a sense of almost guilt to that, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=666.16s)]
*  because my colleagues, Palestinians I've met, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=668.16s)]
*  meet 20-year-olds who are studying at night time, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=671.68s)]
*  second year medicine, and they're hearing these bombardments, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=674.48s)]
*  they've been displaced six times. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=677.24s)]
*  So, there is a very real feel for journalists here, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=678.92s)]
*  hundreds killed, more UN workers [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=681.76s)]
*  than in any conflict since World War II, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=683.76s)]
*  and certainly more children in a small period of time [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=685.96s)]
*  than we've ever seen before. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=689.52s)]
*  So, anyone here would be naive to feel safe. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=690.88s)]
*  It is a desperately unsafe area. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  It's a theater of war there where there's no respect [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=696.6s)]
*  whatsoever for civilians, for United Nations, for journalists. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=698.72s)]
*  But my greatest fears are for, as I've heard from those parents, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=701.8000000000001s)]

*  they cannot go to bed and look their daughter in the eye [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=708.52s)]
*  and promise them they'll be awake. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  Children here learned a long time ago [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=712.36s)]
*  that their parents have lost that ability to protect them. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=714.4s)]
*  That's a horrible thing. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=717.12s)]
*  One of the things that has made world leaders speak out [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=719.12s)]
*  is not just the bombing, which they were fine with for 20 months, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=721.52s)]
*  but it's the starvation that we're seeing on our screens. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=724.48s)]
*  It's very hard to justify the mass starvation of 2 million people. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=726.52s)]
*  The Israelis are still trying, though. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=730.6s)]
*  They're denying that any starvation or famine in Gaza. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  Have a listen to Benjamin Netanyahu speaking on this issue. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=735.68s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of prisoners [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=739.4s)]
*  have taken their shirt off. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=743.7199999999999s)]
*  And you don't see one, not one, emaciated, not a single case, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=745.56s)]
*  from the beginning of the war till the present. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=751.8s)]
*  In fact, you see quite the opposite [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=754.88s)]
*  because you don't get that much exercise, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=757.0s)]
*  certainly not in tunnels, but you get food. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  James, you just arrived in Gaza. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=761.3199999999999s)]
*  Is what you're seeing different to what Netanyahu is claiming? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=763.8399999999999s)]
*  Matty, within half an hour of being here [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=768.12s)]
*  and having thousands of people coming to the vehicles, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=770.5999999999999s)]
*  hoping it was some sort of aid, I had teenage boys, teenage boys, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=773.0s)]
*  you know, in tears, tapping on my window, showing me their ribs. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=777.24s)]
*  You know, I can see if I meet colleagues who I know before, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=781.0400000000001s)]
*  or Palestinians, you see that gautness. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=784.2800000000001s)]
*  You know, there is evidence across the Gaza Strip, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=787.0s)]
*  the world's most respectable nutritional body. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=789.64s)]
*  That's why they came out and said that everyone is food insecure. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=792.6s)]
*  I spoke to a nutrition colleague tonight [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  who wishes it wasn't the case, made it very clear, James, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=797.64s)]
*  if things don't change, we will see famine here. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=800.0s)]
*  And we know there's a famine, it's too late, people have started to die. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=802.6s)]
*  So we've seen the level of severe malnutrition among children [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=805.88s)]
*  double since that blockade. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=809.08s)]
*  So I wish there was these work worth the cases. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=810.88s)]
*  Of course, everyone does here. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=813.64s)]
*  It is the absolute preoccupation now. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=815.2s)]
*  People talk less about the bombardments and the drones [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=817.72s)]
*  and more about every single day looking for food [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=820.52s)]
*  or something that resembles a nutrition. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=823.4s)]
*  This is a nutritional crisis that we have. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=825.6s)]
*  We rarely see unless we are hundreds of miles from help [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=827.9200000000001s)]
*  where you can eat air drops, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=831.44s)]
*  certainly not when there are thousands of trucks 20 miles away. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=832.6400000000001s)]
*  UN Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez posted on Twitter [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=837.4000000000001s)]
*  that it's unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=840.2s)]
*  He called for an investigation into the killings near the food distribution site. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=843.32s)]
*  And in response, House Republican Elise Stefanik called him an anti-Semite [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=847.2s)]
*  and said he should resign, tweeting, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=852.6s)]
*  This is outrageous and the culmination of morally bankrupt leadership. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=854.6s)]
*  I have to ask James, as someone who's been in the UN system for many years, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=857.96s)]
*  been to many war zones. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=861.36s)]
*  What is it like in Gaza uniquely having to tiptoe around [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  speaking about the atrocities in Gaza? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=868.96s)]
*  Because you might get called a bigot by pro-Israel folks. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=871.36s)]
*  You might be called anti-Semitic simply for saying what you're seeing on the ground. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I look, speaking to my own roles as a spokesperson, I simply haven't. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=878.84s)]
*  I haven't tiptoed. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=883.12s)]
*  I couldn't do it in all good conscience, given what I've seen. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=884.48s)]
*  I've seen things here I could not erase from my memory if I tried. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=887.24s)]
*  I've been asked to compare crises. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=890.96s)]
*  I hate doing that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=892.48s)]
*  But there's nothing I've seen here that is close, close to other conflict zones. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=893.56s)]
*  So I would feel complicit if I was not to speak candidly [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=897.8s)]
*  within the mandate that UNICEF is offered about what is happening here, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=901.36s)]
*  about this forced starvation of people, about 17,000 children. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=904.88s)]
*  So much has been normalized, Medigian. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=910.04s)]
*  I have a great problem with it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=911.88s)]
*  I'm in a hospital today that had three drone attacks, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=913.28s)]
*  normalized attacks on hospitals. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=915.7600000000001s)]
*  There's a child there who's lost his whole family. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  We've normalized that this idea that people are gone, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=919.8800000000001s)]
*  but maybe there's not family yet. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=922.96s)]
*  We've normalized that. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=924.36s)]
*  There is nothing normal, normal about this. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=925.5200000000001s)]
*  And yes, you take a great deal of a great deal of heat. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=927.7600000000001s)]
*  But, you know, facts matter. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=931.36s)]
*  Truth matters. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=933.0400000000001s)]
*  And, you know, sincerity when it comes to what is being said from the other side, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=933.96s)]
*  sincerity is subject to proof. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=937.84s)]
*  James Elder, we'll have to leave it there. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=940.5200000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for taking time out for us. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=941.9200000000001s)]
*  Please do stay safe in Gaza. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUdmF0IuDYg&t=943.72s)]
