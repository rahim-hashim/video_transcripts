Video Description: “What went wrong is the question a lot of people are asking right now.”

Kamala Harris underperformed Joe Biden in every single state across the country, eviscerating any path she may have had to victory.

To discuss how her campaign made so many wrong turns and was painted as elitist by billionaires like Trump and Musk, Mehdi Hasan talks to Ryan Grim, co-founder of Drop Site News, and Don Calloway, former Missouri Representative and founder of the National Voter Protection Action Fund.

# “Party of the Elites”: How Republicans Tapped Into Anti-Elitist Sentiment
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc)
*  So what went wrong is the question a lot of people are asking right now. Progressives, liberals, leftists, Democrats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining me now to talk about what went horribly wrong is Don Calloway, Democratic Party strategist, CEO of Pine Street Strategies. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=6.44s)]
*  Ryan Grim, progressive journalist, co-founder of DropSight News, my former colleague at The Intercept. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  Don, Democrats, what the F happened? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=19.62s)]
*  We don't know. I do know a couple of things. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=23.3s)]
*  First of all, this was the first time at 45 years old that I know that what I thought was going to happen was purely dictated by what was being fed through my algorithm. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=25.5s)]
*  And, you know, I fear for our kids because I certainly was not immune to it and it completely... I was nose blind to the possibility. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=34.5s)]
*  Yeah, the vibes were off. I was completely blindsided by the possibility that, you know, it's going to be close, but the landslide in his favor was completely unbeknownst to me. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=42.18s)]
*  I think there are some practical concerns or some things to think about about how possible was it with a 120-day campaign? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=52.68s)]
*  There's a reason these things are protracted in their two years because it takes standing up a massive special vehicle corporation with a very unique purpose. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  And I don't know that that was possible to do in 120 days. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=68.42s)]
*  I also think, lastly, it's important to recognize that Donald Trump won this second administration 20 years ago when The Apprentice started. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=71.7s)]
*  And that's where we are in terms of our collective brain space in America. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=79.1s)]
*  Donald Trump has been the most famous man in America for a long time, and that didn't diminish, particularly even though he's been in the news every single day over the last four years while Biden's been president. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=83.69999999999999s)]
*  So that name recognition is just extremely hard to penetrate and Kamala Harris wasn't able to do it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=94.02s)]
*  Ryan, incumbency is a problem across the world right now, post pandemic. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=98.46s)]
*  In the UK, the Conservative government got wiped out. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=102.5s)]
*  In France, Macron got hit. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=104.94s)]
*  In India, Modi lost his majority. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=106.34s)]
*  The ANC took a hit. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=108.38s)]
*  ANC, South Korea. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=109.58s)]
*  How much of this was Democrats losing the election? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=111.06s)]
*  How much of this was Trump winning the election? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=114.22s)]
*  I mean, I think it's some of both. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=117.3s)]
*  And I think it's fair to put it in the global context because I have criticisms of how the Democratic Party has aligned itself with a more upper middle class section of the electorate over the last 20 plus years, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=118.7s)]
*  maybe 40 years, depending on when you count the realignment starting. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=132.9s)]
*  But I have to be honest and say it's happened in every developed country around the world. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  And so that suggests that there's something fundamental going on in these Western economies, including Japan, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=142.54s)]
*  that pushes this kind of cultural liberalism into kind of opposition with a working class, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  which then moves into the center right, which is only then buttressed by a migration crisis, which you saw in Europe 10 years ago. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=161.02s)]
*  Like we witnessed that unfold after the war in Syria. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=168.5s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=172.82s)]
*  If Ryan Grim is going to get into the real shit, I'm happy to do that, too. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=173.94s)]
*  At the end of the day, I'm headed up to Howard University right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=177.74s)]
*  And it is the Mecca. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=181.22s)]
*  It is an institution which we have so much pride in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=182.94s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Howard is Black Harvard. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=185.3s)]
*  Right. These are two extraordinarily elite privileged institutions that we send the best of ours to in their finishing schools. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=187.66s)]
*  But for our politics to be driven by either H, the Harvards or the Howards of the world, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=194.14s)]
*  it just the Democrats learned today that that's not where the majority of working class, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=200.1s)]
*  lower middle class or, God forbid, poor people in this country are. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=203.85999999999999s)]
*  And their policies are garbage. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=207.34s)]
*  But somehow, some way, Republicans found an algorithm to tap into that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=209.1s)]
*  Was it a mistake? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=212.85999999999999s)]
*  Was it a mistake to basically close your campaign alongside Liz Cheney and Mark Cuban? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=213.98s)]
*  Obviously, it was. I mean, hell, you know, sure. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=220.22s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=223.1s)]
*  And John Smoker, this organizer out of Lancaster, I thought had a good phrase for it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=224.66s)]
*  He said people call that tacking to the right or tacking to the center. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=228.66s)]
*  But that's it was tacking to the top. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=231.7s)]
*  It was tacking to the elite. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  And it was solidifying the idea that Trump was already playing into with his right wing populist tropes, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=235.14s)]
*  that Democrats are the party of elites and the Cheneys are elites. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=241.74s)]
*  Like that's and, you know, they stand in for warmongering. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=244.78s)]
*  They stand in inexplicable reason. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=249.02s)]
*  Donald Trump and Elon Musk are not elites. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=251.38s)]
*  That's popular. We know they are, but they're perceived, they've been coded. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=254.82000000000002s)]
*  Right. Right wing. Right wing populism allows for certain. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=258.06s)]
*  And that's the purpose of right wing populism is to distract the attention that ought to be on all of the point one percent and all of the one percent [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=261.94s)]
*  over to immigrants down here at the bottom or some set of other. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=271.14000000000004s)]
*  And then stand ins for the one percent and the stand ins here are Hollywood, the media, Howard and Harvard. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=275.66s)]
*  Like, but let's speak. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=284.66s)]
*  And I think I will say that you're spot on. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=286.70000000000005s)]
*  And also, there's a particularly pernicious element of those guys owning the infrastructure of information in a way that's never been that way. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=289.54s)]
*  You know, to purchase it before they just had my own. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=296.5s)]
*  Now they've got Murdoch and Musk. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=298.62s)]
*  And Twitter and the Internet and all those all this, you know, it's I mean, Ryan, just to pick up on the information point, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  people said to me yesterday, well, 28 percent of the country think the country is going in the right direction. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=308.02000000000004s)]
*  You cannot get reelection when there's that many people are negative about the direction of the country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=312.58000000000004s)]
*  But that negativity is not based on anything real. And maybe you'll disagree with me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=316.3s)]
*  Obviously, people are suffering in America, but they've always suffered in America in terms of the big trends. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=319.86s)]
*  We know the U.S. economy is doing very well compared to its peers. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=323.18s)]
*  We know that crime is actually down, not up. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=326.5s)]
*  We know that border crossings, the big issue for the right, are lower now than when Trump left office. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=328.74s)]
*  And yet, thanks to the information environment, people don't know this or they don't believe it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=334.14000000000004s)]
*  Well, prices at the grocery store got high and stayed high. Rent is high. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=338.58000000000004s)]
*  Mortgage rates are crazy. Climate is creating all kinds of anxiety. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=342.98s)]
*  Like, it's not it's not great. Like their kids are our kids are on like phones too much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=347.26000000000005s)]
*  Like there's a mental health crisis like we've never seen before. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=351.54s)]
*  Things are things are not great. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=355.18s)]
*  Those are not partisan issues, right? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=356.26000000000005s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=357.62s)]
*  That's a general. Trump has no solutions. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=358.46s)]
*  But they express themselves through a type of anxiety, which then Trump tries to channel in his direction. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=360.62s)]
*  And I think I'm curious for your take on this. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=365.86s)]
*  There's a famous Schumer quote where he says, you know, for every rural vote we lose in central Pennsylvania, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=368.26s)]
*  we're going to pick up two in the suburbs. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  And what I think he and I understand his calculation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=377.18s)]
*  He's a rural population of America's 18 percent. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=380.1s)]
*  We could lose them all. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=383.54s)]
*  And as long as we have the suburbs and the cities, we still win. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=384.98s)]
*  But what he misunderstood is that there is actually a cultural through line among working class people who live in rural areas [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=388.02s)]
*  and working class people who live in suburban areas, exurban areas and working class people who live in the cities. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=396.06s)]
*  And so you picked up those suburban votes, but at the cost, not just of that one guy in central Pennsylvania, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=401.58s)]
*  but of other people who have similar lives but happen to live in the suburbs in Bucks County. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=409.26000000000005s)]
*  And then you see Philadelphia, Allentown, Pittsburgh, all across New Jersey. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=415.18s)]
*  Like this analysis. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=421.38000000000005s)]
*  My worry is there's not enough suburbs to win. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=422.98s)]
*  My worry is that what does it say for us as a country that we can identify all these problems? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=425.54s)]
*  But Donald Trump is the solution. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=429.94000000000005s)]
*  This idea of people's saying inflation is what drove a lot of this. Right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=431.22s)]
*  OK, but you've just elected a man who's going to drive up prices with tariffs. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=434.82000000000005s)]
*  But it's not about policy. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=437.58s)]
*  There is no policy space. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=440.34s)]
*  There is no there's no substantive solution that he presented that justified him as the savior for any of these very serious challenges that you've identified. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=442.18s)]
*  And that's why you can't we cannot diminish two things. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=451.38s)]
*  First of all, he ran against a black woman, even though he offered nothing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=454.74s)]
*  He ran against a black woman. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=458.21999999999997s)]
*  And there is racism and sexism baked into it, especially dangerous when you merge that with the private ownership of information vehicles. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=459.46s)]
*  We have never faced this in our country. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=467.58000000000004s)]
*  And it is completely wide open for some smart progressive to figure out how we're going to overcome that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=469.78000000000003s)]
*  But I have to imagine that the successful campaigns of the next 10 years will have to look dramatically different than democratic infrastructure has looked like in the profession that raised Ryan and I. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=474.98s)]
*  And I can say and maybe you had this experience, too, as somebody who's in the independent media. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=483.82000000000005s)]
*  Our show on breaking points last night consistently had close to 100000 people watching millions of viewers. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=489.66s)]
*  No attention from Democrats. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=496.22s)]
*  Lots of attention from Republicans. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=498.06s)]
*  I hope that this is the last Democratic nominee who says no to Joe Rogan. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=500.82s)]
*  Even if you have to go to the studio, I would go further than that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=505.58000000000004s)]
*  You need your own Joe Rogan is the bigger point. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=508.90000000000003s)]
*  That's the bigger problem. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=511.02s)]
*  Well, Democrats and Democrats had their own Joe Rogan. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=512.02s)]
*  Joe Rogan endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2020. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=514.58s)]
*  Well, look where you end up. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=517.1s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Don. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=518.5799999999999s)]
*  You said that racism and sexism baked in. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=519.42s)]
*  So on that basis, was it a mistake to switch from Biden to Harris so late in the game? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=522.5s)]
*  I was in favor of it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=527.02s)]
*  I don't know where you stood on it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=528.54s)]
*  It's very difficult to say whether or not it was a mistake. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=529.5s)]
*  Or at least I had a open primary. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=531.54s)]
*  I don't think I don't think I don't think so. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=533.02s)]
*  The second piece is the question. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=535.6999999999999s)]
*  And in my view, once it became clear or once whatever powers that are decided, Joe Biden moved on. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=537.0999999999999s)]
*  I think you had nowhere to go. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=543.4599999999999s)]
*  But Kamala Harris, I think that the proper. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=544.66s)]
*  If you wanted to have a liberal hunger games, the proper time to do that was a year ago or maybe even two years ago. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=547.46s)]
*  Yes, I know. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=553.26s)]
*  And we didn't do it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=554.02s)]
*  And, you know, but I think Kamala Harris could have won that possibly should have won that. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=555.62s)]
*  But to transition to her without a contest, I don't think that was the challenge. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=560.6600000000001s)]
*  That's what had to be done at that time when he stepped aside. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=566.1800000000001s)]
*  Ryan, just to wrap this up, Joe Biden, we haven't talked about the sitting president of the United States, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=569.7s)]
*  the guy in the building whose unpopularity clearly dragged Harris down in companies. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=573.78s)]
*  He was clearly a huge issue, rightly or wrongly. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=577.62s)]
*  People thought he did a bad job on the economy. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  I think people are wrong about that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=581.9s)]
*  But where does Biden figure today? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=583.02s)]
*  What is his legacy? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=585.66s)]
*  What is his role in this defeat? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=586.6999999999999s)]
*  I think on the economy, his big mistake was you remember when inflation started going up and we started to get some corporate earnings calls where they were saying this is an opportunity for us to raise prices and keep them high. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=589.1s)]
*  They were saying it publicly and I was saying it constantly. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=603.7s)]
*  Other people started saying it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=608.26s)]
*  And then the White House economists sent out a message publicly that said this. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=610.1400000000001s)]
*  We don't have the data for this stuff. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=615.1s)]
*  I didn't stop me. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=616.9000000000001s)]
*  It's tragic. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=617.7800000000001s)]
*  But I'm not I can't talk to the whole country. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=618.62s)]
*  If he had hit that and that's that's the kind of left wing populace. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=621.4200000000001s)]
*  So his legacy is is getting crushed by a pretty good economy because he couldn't like actually go. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  Doesn't that go to the point of what you said? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=632.6999999999999s)]
*  And let's wrap up with a really good point you made earlier about tacking to the top versus tacking to the left or right. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=634.38s)]
*  It's not about left or right or even being a socialist or Bernie. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=639.6999999999999s)]
*  It's about Democrats being able to identify villains, enemies, opponents in the way that Republicans do from trans kids to Iran to liberal elites on the coast. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=642.3399999999999s)]
*  They're very good at finding enemies. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=653.14s)]
*  Democrats prefer to campaign with their enemies. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=654.62s)]
*  The CEO of this grocery chain who just said on a call that he's going to raise your prices not because he has to, but because he can. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=657.02s)]
*  And that you let that's your enemy. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=664.5s)]
*  Open up a case. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=666.8199999999999s)]
*  Last word to you, Don. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=667.78s)]
*  What can Democrats do to recover, if anything, in the next year or two? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=669.14s)]
*  Well, you have to demand a ceasefire and you have to use the levers that you have in every level of government to show people that you are willing to demand a ceasefire, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=672.74s)]
*  even when you didn't have the White House, to expect so many people who fully have disagreed with the treatment of Palestinians to actively participate and sign the box next to the Democratic name. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=682.0999999999999s)]
*  Just because we had a an exciting candidate perhaps was a fatal mistake. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  So I would move immediately into trying to stop the war. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=699.38s)]
*  And frankly, Joe Biden is still president for two months to try to achieve that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=702.14s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that I was going to listen to Joe Biden now. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=706.0999999999999s)]
*  He's a he's a happiest man in the world. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=708.54s)]
*  And I fear that Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, if they do win the House, is not someone who's known for pro-Palestinian sentiments. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=710.18s)]
*  Let us see. Ryan Grim, Don Calloway, appreciate you joining me today for this important conversation. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOPJcZ7sybc&t=715.5799999999999s)]
