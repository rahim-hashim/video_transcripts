# “I hope your beeper doesn’t go off": Mehdi Hasan Responds to Racist Attack on CNN
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI)
*  I have interviewed, debated, sparred with controversial, opinionated, offensive people from across the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=0.0s)]
*  Sitting presidents and prime ministers, former directors of the CIA and Mossad, Trump officials, Biden officials, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=8.0s)]
*  a Netanyahu spokesman, a Hamas spokesman, an IRA leader, Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=14.0s)]
*  But never, never in my 25 years as a journalist and 15 years of doing live TV have I been so stunned [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=20.0s)]
*  by what was said to me that I had to walk off set in the middle of a live show, as I did on Monday night on CNN in New York when this happened. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=28.0s)]
*  If you don't want to be called Nazis, stop doing it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=37.0s)]
*  You're called S.A.B.I. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=40.0s)]
*  Stop saying things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=42.0s)]
*  People will sit there and say, no, by me, I never called you S.A.B.I. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=44.0s)]
*  I'm a supporter of the Palestinians, I'm used to it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=48.0s)]
*  Well, I hope your beeper doesn't go off. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=50.0s)]
*  The thing is, is that... [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=52.0s)]
*  Did you just say I should die? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=54.0s)]
*  Did you just say I should be killed? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=56.0s)]
*  No, I did not say that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=58.0s)]
*  Did you just say I should be killed? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=60.0s)]
*  Yes, that was far-right pundit Ryan Gadusky reacting to me saying I support Palestinians by basically inciting violence against me, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=62.0s)]
*  suggesting I might be blown up in the way that Hezbollah members and Lebanese civilians were blown up via their beepers by Israel [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=70.0s)]
*  in what the former CIA chief Leon Panetta called a clear terrorist attack. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=77.0s)]
*  That's what Gadusky casually suggested might happen to me. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=81.0s)]
*  He said, no, by me, JD Vance associate Ryan Gadusky, Trump supporter Ryan Gadusky. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=84.0s)]
*  Because in his head, when he hears Palestinian, he hears Hamas. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=90.0s)]
*  When he sees a Muslim in front of him, he sees Hamas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=94.0s)]
*  Now, he and his right-wing friends are saying, I called him. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=98.0s)]
*  I called all Republicans Nazis, which, of course, I didn't. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=101.0s)]
*  Although apparently white supremacist Richard Spencer claims Gadusky used to write for him. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=105.0s)]
*  What I did say was that if you, if people, if one, if you don't want to be called a Nazi, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=111.0s)]
*  don't say Nazi-like things, as was said at the Trump rally in New York on Sunday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=117.0s)]
*  Jews are cheap, black people like watermelons, Muslims are terrorists. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=122.0s)]
*  And this guy's response to that was to imply I'm a terrorist who might be killed by Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=127.0s)]
*  A line that wasn't a joke and that he almost certainly came pre-prepared with, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=133.0s)]
*  thinking he could get away with it on live national television. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=138.0s)]
*  That's how bold these MAGA Republicans have become with their racism. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=142.0s)]
*  That's the permission structure Trump and Vance have created [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=147.0s)]
*  with the help of some in our media who've just happily platformed it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=150.0s)]
*  But as shocked and stunned as I was, there was no way I was going to let him say that to me, unchallenged. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=154.0s)]
*  And I'm glad to see CNN has since banned him from their airwaves. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=160.0s)]
*  And I appreciate host Abby Phillip apologizing to the viewers and to me after I walked off set. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=164.0s)]
*  I do want to do a shout-out here, by the way, to my fellow panelist Ashley Allison, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=170.0s)]
*  a former Biden-Harris 2020 campaign staffer, who was with me on that panel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=174.0s)]
*  What you just said, I apologize, but I will tell you, I don't accept that apology. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=179.0s)]
*  And you didn't even say it to me. That was disgusting. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=183.0s)]
*  But I can be offended when you don't even say it to me. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=185.0s)]
*  I'm not Puerto Rican, but I was offended by what he said yesterday. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=188.0s)]
*  Where would we be as a country without black women holding the line against racism and bigotry [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=191.0s)]
*  and showing us what solidarity looks like? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=197.0s)]
*  If Harris wins next week, it'll be partly because of her fellow black women holding that line. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=200.0s)]
*  And if she loses, and to be clear, because of her refusal to budge even an inch on Gaza, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=205.0s)]
*  Harris morally deserves to lose. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=209.0s)]
*  We will get a Trump presidency, a white supremacist presidency, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=212.0s)]
*  an anti-black, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic presidency, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=216.0s)]
*  in which people like the bigot I had to deal with on CNN will be emboldened like never before. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=219.0s)]
*  They won't just be running their mouths on TV panels against public figures like me. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=224.0s)]
*  They'll be at your kid's school gate. They'll be at your grocery store. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=229.0s)]
*  They'll be in your subway car, proudly and shamelessly saying this stuff to you, too. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=232.0s)]
*  They'll also be in charge of US foreign policy, egging on Israel to do more beeper attacks, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=238.0s)]
*  even more acts of terror, egging on Trump and Vance to be more racist, more violent, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=243.0s)]
*  both at home and abroad. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=248.0s)]
*  A white liberal friend of mine, while sending me a very supportive text yesterday, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=250.0s)]
*  asked me in good faith, is it emotionally taxing to face this bigotry, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=254.0s)]
*  or is it par for the course at this point? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=259.0s)]
*  To which my answer is, sadly, we Muslims don't have thicker skins than everyone else. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=262.0s)]
*  Nor should we have to have thicker skins than everyone else. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=268.0s)]
*  We're human beings, so of course it's emotionally taxing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=272.0s)]
*  But that's the whole point. That's why they do it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=276.0s)]
*  Racism is about not just dehumanising you, but demoralising you and depressing you. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=279.0s)]
*  It's about beating you down and keeping you on the defensive, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=284.0s)]
*  forcing you to fight an uphill battle, and apparently even threatening you with a terrorist attack. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=287.0s)]
*  As the one and only Toni Morrison so wisely, so eloquently, so rightly said, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=293.0s)]
*  the function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=298.0s)]
*  It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining over and over again your reason for being. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=303.0s)]
*  Well, to be clear, less than a week out from the most consequential election of our lifetimes, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=309.0s)]
*  with genocide on the ballot, yes, but also fascism plus genocide on the ballot, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=315.0s)]
*  I'm in no mood to explain myself to the racists and bullies. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=321.0s)]
*  But I will continue to speak out. I will continue to do the work. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=325.0s)]
*  And so should you. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=330.0s)]
*  Thank you for watching, and thank you for being a subscriber to Zateo. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSq7vnw3gWI&t=332.0s)]
