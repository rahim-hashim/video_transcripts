# UN Aid Chief In THERAPY After Gaza Visit
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0)
*  You visited Gaza, I believe back in February. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=0.0s)]
*  How shocking was it to be there on the ground? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=3.4s)]
*  Well, you prepare yourself, you try to. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=6.4s)]
*  But the reality is that nothing can prepare you for what you see. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=8.8s)]
*  I've been to Darfur, I've been to Kupiansk on the Ukraine front lines. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=11.32s)]
*  I've driven up through Syria just after the fall of the Assad regime. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Nothing was as bad as going to Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=18.0s)]
*  Is Gaza undergoing a famine right now? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  And if so, isn't it a man-made famine? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=22.52s)]
*  So it's not that there isn't food there, it's just we're not allowed to get it in. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=24.88s)]
*  Bye. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=27.72s)]
*  Israel won't let us move that food through at the scale we need to. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  Israel says Hamas is looting the aid and diverting the aid. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=32.24s)]
*  Have you seen evidence of that? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  What we're seeing here is an atrocity. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=36.0s)]
*  We are seeing levels of starvation which are completely avoidable. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=37.92s)]
*  What do you make of Israel's relationship with the United Nations? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=41.16s)]
*  It's very hard to hear yourself be called anti-Semitic. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=43.32s)]
*  I will fight anti-Semitism with every bone in my body. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=46.76s)]
*  What would you say to people, especially activists on the ground, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=48.76s)]
*  who say the UN has failed the people of Gaza and failed the people of Sudan? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=51.0s)]
*  I think the world has failed the people of Gaza. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=55.04s)]
*  UNHCR [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=58.72s)]
*  The genocide continues in Gaza. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=64.4s)]
*  Unabated, Israel's bombs continue to drop on civilians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=66.92s)]
*  And aid just isn't getting through to starving and besieged Palestinians in the Strip. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=70.2s)]
*  The UN humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, a Brit, has been to Gaza. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=75.16s)]
*  And he was also at the UN Security Council last month, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=79.88s)]
*  urging member nations to stop this quote, 21st century atrocity. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=82.16s)]
*  And he joins me now, Tom Fletcher, thanks so much for coming on May the Unfiltered. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=86.80000000000001s)]
*  You visited Gaza, I believe back in February. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  What was that like? What did you see? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  How shocking was it to be there on the ground? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=96.2s)]
*  Well, you prepare yourself, you try to, for a visit like that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=99.2s)]
*  I talked to a lot of people who've been in, a lot of our staff. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=102.68s)]
*  But the reality is that nothing can prepare you for what you see. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  And I'd been in Neroz, one of those kibbutz that was attacked on October the 7th, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=108.48s)]
*  and I'd been sat with survivors, one in four people there were killed or taken hostage. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=111.76s)]
*  And then drove across the border from the north of Gaza, so into the area worst affected. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=116.4s)]
*  And you drive for miles and miles and it is just desolate. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=121.92s)]
*  It's rubble. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=126.84s)]
*  And I asked the colleague with me, you know, why the dog's fat? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=128.32s)]
*  And he said, because the dogs are pulling corpses from the rubble. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=134.24s)]
*  I asked my colleagues, you know, where their houses at where their homes were. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=138.16s)]
*  And they would say, we don't know, you have to use GPS to find the location of your old home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=141.6s)]
*  It's flattened. Because there are no landmarks. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=145.68s)]
*  You don't you can't tell what was a school, what was a mosque, what was a hospital. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  And you drive for hours and hours like that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=152.52s)]
*  I went to the hospitals that have been bombed out and attacked. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=154.36s)]
*  I visited that hospital where the doctor had written on the on the wall, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=157.36s)]
*  tell them that we did what we could. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=160.76s)]
*  And in a way, since then, that's been motivating the way I try to approach this crisis. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=162.32s)]
*  You said to the UN Security Council last month, I can tell you from having visited [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=167.88s)]
*  what's left of Gaza's medical system, that death on this scale has a sound and a smell [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=171.68s)]
*  that does not leave you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=177.28s)]
*  There's a memory of your trip to Gaza and you go all over the place. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  I know you've been to Ukraine. You're heading to the DRC. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  You've been to Afghanistan. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=185.12s)]
*  But does that memory of your trip to Gaza in particular, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=186.96s)]
*  does it still torment you and haunt you? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=190.84s)]
*  It's a pretty when I heard you say that, I watched you speak in the Security Council. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  A smell that does not leave you. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=198.12s)]
*  So, you know, I have one of those passports that security agents love to confiscate. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=200.48s)]
*  I've been to Darfur. I've been to Kupiansk on the Ukraine front lines. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=204.48s)]
*  I've driven up through Syria just after the fall of the Assad regime. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  I've just been in Kandahar, Kabul, Kunduz and Afghanistan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=211.16s)]
*  I was in Mandalay just after the earthquake. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=214.72s)]
*  Nothing was as bad as going to Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=217.32s)]
*  And it is that smell and that sound of death on this scale and trauma on this scale. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=220.2s)]
*  So often there is just silence and you're just walking through these utterly desolate landscapes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  with people who aren't talking and you're asking questions and trying to... [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=234.88s)]
*  Everyone there, including all of our staff, is traumatized. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=239.6s)]
*  And so, yes, you do carry that with you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=243.76s)]
*  I think about it every single day. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=245.88s)]
*  I've started therapy myself because I think that it's important that we find ways to deal with these experiences. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=249.68s)]
*  Because of your job in general or because of Gaza? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  Because of my job in general, but particularly because of experiences like going to Gaza and seeing death on that... [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=259.24s)]
*  You know, being with people who have lost everything, including all of their children, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=264.0s)]
*  sitting with a grandmother who basically watched her kid die in front of her from a sniper attack [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=268.0s)]
*  and bleed out on the road and nurses get shot as they came to help her. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=272.91999999999996s)]
*  So, look, my experience is nothing like being someone living in Gaza or living in Darfur [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=278.4s)]
*  or living in Afghanistan right now. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=284.6s)]
*  But it's a heavy responsibility because you feel the obligation to share that story because you can't get in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=286.6s)]
*  Not just you, Mehdi, but the international media are not allowed in to cover this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=292.76s)]
*  Palestinian journalists inside Gaza are being killed in large numbers. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=296.92s)]
*  And so we do feel this responsibility, this obligation to share these stories. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=300.4s)]
*  So you have destruction, you have rubble, you have bombs still falling as we speak. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=305.48s)]
*  And then, of course, you have the aid situation, you have the lack of food and water and medicines and the rest. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=310.64000000000004s)]
*  Is Gaza, you went there, this is what you do for a living, you cover humanitarian crises, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=316.8s)]
*  is Gaza undergoing a famine right now? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=321.48s)]
*  And if so, isn't it a man-made famine? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=323.68s)]
*  So we are seeing massive levels of starvation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=340.6s)]
*  Everyone in Gaza right now is hungry. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  Everyone needs feeding. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=345.72s)]
*  You know, my staff are malnourished as well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=347.12s)]
*  And just to pick up on one point here, it's not because of lack of food. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=349.96000000000004s)]
*  We have the food. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=354.44s)]
*  It is sat there on the border. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=355.56s)]
*  We have provisions to fill 9,600 trucks right now. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  That's baby food, food, medicine, shelter. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=360.40000000000003s)]
*  A lot of people really badly need shelter right now. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=363.40000000000003s)]
*  So it's not that there isn't food there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=366.0s)]
*  It's just we're not allowed to get it in. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=367.72s)]
*  It's just we're not allowed to get it in. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=369.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=370.68s)]
*  Israel won't let us move that food through at the scale we need to. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=371.68s)]
*  We're getting a dribble of food, a dribble of trucks across the border. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=375.36s)]
*  And on that note, on the dribble of food, what do you make of this US and Israeli-backed [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=379.48s)]
*  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, where we're seeing at their aid site, quote unquote, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=383.71999999999997s)]
*  we're seeing killings of Palestinians almost daily right now. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=388.28s)]
*  You called it last month a distraction and a fig leaf. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=391.44s)]
*  But isn't it much worse than that? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=394.15999999999997s)]
*  So these are militarised hubs, which is why we don't align with them. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=395.8s)]
*  It's why I've been critical of them, why the international community, Security Council [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=400.52s)]
*  members, NGOs and others have been very critical. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=404.68s)]
*  We have to deliver aid in a way which is impartial, neutral, independent. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=407.68s)]
*  And we don't believe that this does that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=413.24s)]
*  We believe this is delivering aid in a way that dehumanises Palestinians. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=414.92s)]
*  Just have a look at the photo. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=418.44s)]
*  But also that encourages displacement from people's areas. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=420.64s)]
*  But it is a distraction because we have a plan. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=425.24s)]
*  I've set it out in public again and again and again. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=427.32s)]
*  We can deliver aid at scale. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=429.92s)]
*  We can get food and support to everyone in Gaza. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=431.32s)]
*  We have enough provisions to support everyone for several months. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=434.36s)]
*  And we've done it before because I've seen us doing it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=438.56s)]
*  When I was there in February, halfway through the ceasefire, 42-day ceasefire, we were delivering [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=441.76s)]
*  600, 700 trucks of essential aid every day. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  And we were getting it to the communities, to the kitchens, the bakeries, the people [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=450.40000000000003s)]
*  who really needed it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=454.36s)]
*  So we know how to do this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=455.72s)]
*  We do it in the hardest places in the world. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=457.08000000000004s)]
*  And all I'm asking, and all the world is asking, frankly, is let us do our work. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=459.36s)]
*  Isn't using food, starvation as a weapon of war a war crime and a crime against humanity? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  And isn't that what Israel is doing in Gaza? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  So I'm not a lawyer. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=472.24s)]
*  And you'll appreciate why I have to weigh my words very carefully. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  As I did in the Security Council, I have to do it now with Humidity as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=477.0s)]
*  What we're seeing here is an atrocity. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=482.2s)]
*  We are seeing levels of starvation which are completely avoidable, given that we have the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  food there to go. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=489.28s)]
*  We are seeing the killing of civilians on an extraordinary scale. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  We're seeing horrific hostage taking as well, of course, by Hamas and the atrocities of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=497.2s)]
*  October the 7th. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=500.91999999999996s)]
*  This is an utterly grim, grim situation. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=504.08s)]
*  But it's for lawyers ultimately to decide what we call it. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=507.32s)]
*  This week, we saw Israel board a civilian-age ship, the Freedom Flotilla, the Madeline, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=509.72s)]
*  in international waters, detain 12 activists, including Greta Thunberg, who is also a Zateo [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=513.32s)]
*  contributor. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=518.2s)]
*  She's since been ejected from the country sent to France, which is not where she's from. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=519.2s)]
*  Eight people still remain in custody at the time of our conversation, including a French [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=523.6s)]
*  member of the European Parliament. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  Kind of message, do you think Israel has sent to the world by boarding this ship, blocking [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=529.08s)]
*  the life-saving aid on board? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=532.9s)]
*  What's the UN's message? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=535.88s)]
*  So there's got to be a right to protest, a right to peaceful protest. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=545.16s)]
*  Now, clearly, this isn't the best way to get aid through. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=548.24s)]
*  I can tell you that we can get 600, 700 trucks a day in of masses of life-saving aid. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=551.4s)]
*  They would argue that you're not getting them through, therefore civil society has to do [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=556.28s)]
*  whatever it takes. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=560.18s)]
*  I think what they were, most importantly for them, they were looking to draw attention, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=561.18s)]
*  to get the world's attention to this blockade of aid, and they succeeded in that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=564.9s)]
*  They've got us talking about it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=569.66s)]
*  They've got the media's attention. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=571.18s)]
*  And I think this is symptomatic of a wider acknowledgement, recognition by the world [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  that this situation is absolutely unacceptable now. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=580.0s)]
*  You're seeing more and more governments speaking out much more clearly in support of our efforts [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=582.4599999999999s)]
*  to get aid in. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=586.3399999999999s)]
*  But is there a role for civil society to also try and get aid in? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=587.3399999999999s)]
*  There's a definite role for civil society in calling for change. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=591.1s)]
*  It's a very, very complex security environment on the ground. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=594.86s)]
*  We know the risks we run. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=597.46s)]
*  We negotiate daily to even to do the small amount of convoys we're being allowed to do [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=599.5s)]
*  right now. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=603.9s)]
*  We face looting. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  We face insecurity. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  We face a population which is frankly desperate and starving. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=607.0400000000001s)]
*  So that's the most effective way to deliver aid right now. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=610.38s)]
*  Who's looting the aid? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=613.46s)]
*  So at the moment, we're losing aid as it gets to the points of distribution, desperate, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=614.9s)]
*  starving humans, civilians, parents are taking as much as they can for their kids as I would [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=619.94s)]
*  and as you would. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=627.2600000000001s)]
*  Israel says Hamas is looting the aid and diverting it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=628.2600000000001s)]
*  Have you seen evidence of that? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=630.34s)]
*  We're not seeing that at the moment. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=631.82s)]
*  Now, can I guarantee that not a single grain of rice gets anywhere near to the people with [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=633.0200000000001s)]
*  guns and power inside Gaza? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=637.6s)]
*  Of course we can't stop that happening. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=640.58s)]
*  But we have our distribution networks and we work with the local communities to make [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=642.82s)]
*  sure it gets to families and not to Hamas. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=646.02s)]
*  We face a problem at the moment, which is that a sack of wheat is selling on the black [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=650.16s)]
*  market for $400, $500. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=653.98s)]
*  And the amount we're getting in, we've only got, you know, I said 600, 700 trucks a day. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=656.5799999999999s)]
*  We got in during the ceasefire. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=661.06s)]
*  We haven't got that number in since May 19th when we started. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=662.06s)]
*  But when the Israelis say, hold on, we can't let the UN aid go in because Hamas just takes [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=665.54s)]
*  its stockpiles and sells it, you're saying that's not what happened in February. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=670.34s)]
*  So what we were getting in February, we were being looted by very, very specific gangs [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=673.94s)]
*  who are aligned with Israel. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=678.4200000000001s)]
*  And now we're learning from the Israeli Prime Minister. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=679.4200000000001s)]
*  There's a gang that operates in that, in no man's land. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=681.34s)]
*  And I've driven that road. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=684.1400000000001s)]
*  I've seen them, you know, trying to board the trucks as I was on the convoy going through. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=685.1400000000001s)]
*  And they were operating seemingly with impunity in that area and they were hitting our trucks [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=689.86s)]
*  very hard and then selling that aid on at extortionate prices. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=693.74s)]
*  We're not seeing that so much this time, but we are seeing that civilian looting from utterly [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=698.0600000000001s)]
*  desperate, starving people. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=703.4599999999999s)]
*  I've got to ask. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=704.4599999999999s)]
*  I know you said you're not a lawyer, but you said at the UN Security Council last month, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=705.4599999999999s)]
*  you said to the member nations, will you act decisively to prevent genocide? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=709.18s)]
*  That was your question to member states. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=713.86s)]
*  Do you agree with genocide scholars and UN special rapporteurs who say it is a genocide [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=715.74s)]
*  in Gaza right now? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=720.6999999999999s)]
*  As I say, it's not for me to make that decision. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=721.6999999999999s)]
*  But you raised the G-word at the Security Council. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=725.2199999999999s)]
*  But it's ultimately for the ICJ. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=728.14s)]
*  I'm effectively a witness to that process and that I'm reporting what I'm seeing. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=730.7399999999999s)]
*  But I'm also the USG for the UN. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=734.5s)]
*  And me using words is high risk. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=736.66s)]
*  But I was interested to see that you used the genocide word. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=741.3399999999999s)]
*  So my utter focus right now is on getting the world's attention to get as much aid in [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=743.4599999999999s)]
*  as we can and save as many lives as we can and being creative and solving problems to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=747.8199999999999s)]
*  do that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=751.8599999999999s)]
*  But let me answer your question. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=752.8599999999999s)]
*  What I was calling for was the world to ensure they had done everything to act to prevent [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=756.34s)]
*  genocide because we're waiting for the ICJ. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=760.98s)]
*  And my worry is that in situations like this, and I quoted others, Rwanda, Srebrenica, where [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=764.02s)]
*  later the world said, why didn't you act? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=769.82s)]
*  And we all said, well, we were waiting for a judgment from the courts. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=772.74s)]
*  And I'm saying, don't wait for that judgment. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=775.86s)]
*  Take the action now, in particular, to stop this level of starvation. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=778.0600000000001s)]
*  So I want to come back to whether the member states are taking action or not. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=781.7s)]
*  You mentioned you're trying to get people to act. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=785.58s)]
*  You want to spur them into action. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=788.14s)]
*  Your critics say that leads to people like you and others on the humanitarian side exaggerating [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=790.1s)]
*  how bad things are hyperbole, fear mongering. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=795.0600000000001s)]
*  You know all the accusations. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=797.74s)]
*  Now last month, you claim that 14,000 children could die over the course of the next two [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=799.26s)]
*  days if Israel continued to block aid, which became a headline around the world. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=803.94s)]
*  Pro-Palestine activists were sharing it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=807.7s)]
*  People were stunned. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=809.52s)]
*  I remember seeing that statistic thinking, oh my, what are we going to tolerate now? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=810.52s)]
*  That number was wrong. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=815.12s)]
*  Where did you get that finger from? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=816.84s)]
*  You walked it back, I know. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=818.02s)]
*  Where did you get the figure from? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=819.76s)]
*  And do you think it undermined the UN's credibility, especially at a time when the Israeli government [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=820.92s)]
*  is jumping on that incorrect statistic from you to say, see, the UN can't be trusted? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=825.64s)]
*  I think that's a really key point in all of this is that I have to pick my words really, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=833.08s)]
*  really carefully in order that we can be as trusted as we can by the public. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=837.4s)]
*  So what happened that day? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=841.76s)]
*  So that figure, I'll tell you what happened that day. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=842.8s)]
*  I'd just come from a call with our team on the ground, desperate to get aid in. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=845.2s)]
*  I'd asked them for an update. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=849.28s)]
*  The trucks on the border, we were talking about baby food. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=852.0s)]
*  And I was saying, in what world can we not get baby food through? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=855.56s)]
*  And I said, give me the numbers. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=859.28s)]
*  And they cited to me the report from the IPC. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=861.2s)]
*  The report's out there. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=865.24s)]
*  I encourage your viewers to read it, which talks about 71,000 kids at risk of starvation, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=866.24s)]
*  of which 14,100 are at risk of acute starvation. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=872.32s)]
*  Now, those kids haven't gone away. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=875.88s)]
*  That level of starvation. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=878.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're still a threat. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=879.2s)]
*  But it wasn't the next 24, 48 hours. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=880.2s)]
*  That was your mistake. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=882.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=883.0s)]
*  And it's no consolation to those kids that were arguing over the 24, 48 hours. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=884.0s)]
*  And that, by the way, I called them babies and they're 0 to 5-year-olds. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=886.9000000000001s)]
*  I think it was a timeline that people were jumping on. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=890.7600000000001s)]
*  The issue was the timeline. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=893.7600000000001s)]
*  And in my mind, I was thinking, we've been told we had about 48 hours to get aid in before [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=895.24s)]
*  it got closed down because of these other alternative mechanisms. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=899.3800000000001s)]
*  How did you realise you'd made a mistake? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=901.8399999999999s)]
*  I realised in the following days, particularly as there was a backlash and people quite rightly [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=903.8s)]
*  called on me to correct it, as I then did, obviously several times. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=908.5s)]
*  Not just a backlash. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=911.4799999999999s)]
*  The Israeli Foreign Minister accused you of a blood libel. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=912.4799999999999s)]
*  What is your response to the Israeli Foreign Ministry? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=915.56s)]
*  It's a tough thing to hear. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=917.4799999999999s)]
*  A very tough thing to hear. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=921.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm confident of what I'm doing in this job. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=923.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm confident that the mission is right, that we're saving as many lives as we can. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=925.92s)]
*  And I'm also learning that I have to be utterly clear in my language, which is why I have [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=931.88s)]
*  to be a bit more boring. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm afraid on some of these points where you'd love me to be more interesting [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=939.0799999999999s)]
*  because I've got to focus relentlessly on the life-saving part of this. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=944.36s)]
*  Well, you're going to love my next question because the Israeli government has killed [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=947.4s)]
*  a record number of UN employees in Gaza. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=951.8s)]
*  I think more UN personnel killed than in any other conflict since the creation of the [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=954.92s)]
*  United Nations. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=958.7199999999999s)]
*  It's banned the Secretary General from coming into Israel. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=959.7199999999999s)]
*  They said he's persona non grata. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=962.0s)]
*  First time that's happened for decades. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=963.36s)]
*  It's bombed UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, blocked UN aid, as we've discussed, from going into [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=965.92s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=970.88s)]
*  What do you make of Israel's commitment to the UN? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=971.88s)]
*  Why is it still allowed to be a UN member state when it's thumbing its nose at UN peacekeepers, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=974.64s)]
*  killing UN personnel, blocking the UN Secretary General? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=978.52s)]
*  You are a senior UN official. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=981.36s)]
*  What do you make about the Israel's... [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=982.36s)]
*  What do you make of Israel's relationship with the United Nations? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=983.8000000000001s)]
*  It's challenging right now. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=987.08s)]
*  I mean, I have a dialogue with Israel. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=988.08s)]
*  I spent two or three days there in Tel Aviv, spent time talking... [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=990.36s)]
*  You're not persona non grata. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=993.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=994.84s)]
*  I check my email every day. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, I check Fox News most mornings to see whether it's been announced there or not. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=998.44s)]
*  So that relationship is really difficult. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1004.36s)]
*  And it was difficult when I visited, but we were looking to solve problems. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1006.04s)]
*  We were looking at that stage to get trucks in and save lives during the ceasefire. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1008.8000000000001s)]
*  It's got even harder now because the restrictions, the impediments on our work are even worse. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1012.3s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1017.42s)]
*  Over 300 colleagues, it's an extraordinary number, have died in 18 months or so since [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1018.42s)]
*  this phase of the conflict. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1025.82s)]
*  And we have to meet their families. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1028.3799999999999s)]
*  I have to talk to the colleagues who will replace them and say that we've taken those [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1030.54s)]
*  deaths seriously, that we are working for accountability. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1036.62s)]
*  I have to be confident that we will get accountability, even in a situation where I honestly can't [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1040.58s)]
*  feel that much confidence. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1045.98s)]
*  Recently, we lost a guy. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1047.3799999999999s)]
*  They hit the safe house. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1050.0s)]
*  He went up on the roof. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1051.12s)]
*  It was hit again. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1053.3s)]
*  What do you tell the family double to have a colleague who has died in that situation? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1054.62s)]
*  And of course, Israel is very openly critical. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1059.6999999999998s)]
*  They use pretty tough language, pretty feisty language, which I'm not going to argue on [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1063.06s)]
*  that level. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1070.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, they say the UN and you are anti-Semitic and pro-Helps. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1071.6599999999999s)]
*  They say that very openly. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1074.54s)]
*  It's very hard to hear yourself be called anti-Semitic. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1076.2199999999998s)]
*  I will fight anti-Semitism with every bone in my body, every fibre of my DNA. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1081.62s)]
*  The key thing is, how did the conversation become suddenly about anti-Semitism in all [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1087.6599999999999s)]
*  of this? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1090.8999999999999s)]
*  Why shouldn't we be holding Israel to the same account as every other country? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1091.9799999999998s)]
*  How does that suddenly percolate into being some form of anti-Semitism? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1095.72s)]
*  So, yeah, look, I would say to the Israelis, come back to the UN Charter. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1100.88s)]
*  My friend and colleague, the Israeli ambassador in New York, shredded the UN Charter quite [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1108.56s)]
*  publicly. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1112.08s)]
*  I don't have one with me here, but I've got a UN badge on. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1113.88s)]
*  I will stand for the UN Charter. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1116.96s)]
*  We must stand for it. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1118.16s)]
*  You've mentioned accountability. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1119.16s)]
*  The International Criminal Court is trying to have some accountability done. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1121.32s)]
*  You want an advisor to UK Prime Minister David Cameron. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1125.52s)]
*  Last year, according to new reporting from Middle East Eye, Cameron, in his then role [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1129.04s)]
*  as Foreign Minister of the UK, Foreign Secretary, apparently threatened the ICC prosecutor if [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1132.4s)]
*  he dared bring charges against Israel, which of course he later did. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1136.84s)]
*  Now, I'm not going to ask you about that because I know you're going to give me a quote boring [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1140.08s)]
*  answer. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1143.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1144.4s)]
*  But I will ask a broader question, which is the ICC is part of the international system, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1145.4s)]
*  the UN system. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1147.92s)]
*  Do you think member states should be abiding by ICC warrants, decisions and not threatening [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1148.92s)]
*  the ICC? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1153.82s)]
*  Yes, unequivocally. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1154.98s)]
*  We've got to stand for the rule of law. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1156.78s)]
*  And one great worry in this moment when we're in a more transactional world, more [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1158.54s)]
*  nationalist, more introverted, more selfish actually world, less generous world, I'm [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1163.58s)]
*  conscious that over the coming years we have got to be defending this hill. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1169.34s)]
*  We've got to be defending international law and this international system, this scaffolding [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1173.62s)]
*  which has taken a beating, you would agree, which is taking an absolute beating. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1178.1799999999998s)]
*  And we're in the heat of that. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1181.8999999999999s)]
*  We're feeling scorched by it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1184.38s)]
*  But this scaffolding that we built after the Second World War is there because we'd seen [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1186.22s)]
*  the worst of inhumanity and we've recognised that the world needs those guidelines. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1190.6200000000001s)]
*  The UN is not perfect. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1196.7s)]
*  Far from it. And I work in it. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1198.3000000000002s)]
*  I've been in there six, seven months now. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1200.2600000000002s)]
*  I know that we can be much, much better. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1202.0600000000002s)]
*  But imagine a world without the UN now. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1204.74s)]
*  It is a much darker, grimmer world. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1206.7800000000002s)]
*  And we are out there trying to put those fires out. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1208.98s)]
*  We're underfunded, we're overstretched. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1211.38s)]
*  We're literally, as you said, under attack. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1212.98s)]
*  We're losing our people. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1215.0600000000002s)]
*  But no one's come up with a better idea for global coexistence yet. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1217.7s)]
*  So no one expects the Trump administration or the US in general to be that bigger supporter [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1220.66s)]
*  of what you are doing or UN aid agencies are doing. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1225.3000000000002s)]
*  But the Europeans have always claimed to be big supporters of the multilateral system, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1229.5s)]
*  the rule of law, the rules based order, international agencies. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1233.22s)]
*  And yet the UK, France, they've been very late to the party on this. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1236.7s)]
*  They've recently come out with stronger statements, as you know. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1240.38s)]

*  You were an ambassador in Lebanon. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1248.02s)]
*  You were a foreign policy adviser to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, both parties. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1249.26s)]
*  Why do you think the British government has been so late to take a stronger stance on this? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1254.6999999999998s)]
*  What is your message to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has now come out saying [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1258.62s)]
*  what we're seeing is abhorrent. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1263.1s)]
*  He's using language that we haven't heard before in relation to aid, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1264.82s)]
*  in relation to your particular field and what's happening in Gaza. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1268.4199999999998s)]
*  What's your message to the British government? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1271.8600000000001s)]
*  What should they be saying and doing right now to make your job easier [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1273.38s)]
*  and to help Gazans get food? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1275.98s)]
*  My message to the British government is, as it is to every government [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1277.66s)]
*  around the world, is back us to get the aid in and stand for international law [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1279.98s)]
*  and accountability and start in the position that they're not doing. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1283.38s)]
*  That's just rhetoric. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1286.66s)]
*  What should they be doing that they're not doing? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1287.78s)]
*  But the rhetoric does matter at the moment. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1289.34s)]
*  In a moment when so much is being challenged, the rhetoric itself [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1290.82s)]
*  gives reassurance to the world that we do take these principles and values seriously. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1294.22s)]
*  You'd be picking up the phone, using the pressure that you have [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1298.66s)]
*  as a government on on Israel itself, on other parties, on [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1301.06s)]
*  in the conversation with the US. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1306.34s)]

*  to do a trade deal. No one's talking about. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1311.6599999999999s)]
*  It's a boring point, but defense of the rules based international order. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1313.82s)]
*  These issues, which are particularly important for countries of the size, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1317.4199999999998s)]
*  heft of the UK, France, others in Europe that you've mentioned. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1321.3799999999999s)]
*  I've just come back from a week in Europe. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1325.3s)]
*  I had nothing but unequivocal support for those ideas. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1327.22s)]
*  And this sense that we have got to be more united and stronger, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1329.98s)]
*  more robust in pushing to get aid in and standing for principle. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1333.3400000000001s)]
*  We're in Washington, D.C. right now. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1336.98s)]
*  I'm not going to ask you if you're heading to the White House. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1338.46s)]
*  But do you have any plans to head for Mar-a-Lago yourself? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1339.8600000000001s)]
*  I haven't yet had the invitation to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1342.38s)]
*  If I get the invitation, I'll go tomorrow. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1344.1000000000001s)]
*  But right away, I think there's work to be done here with Mar-a-Lago, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1346.7s)]
*  with President Trump. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1350.3400000000001s)]
*  I think this is a whatever you think of President Trump. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1351.18s)]
*  This is someone who clearly does want peace. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1355.38s)]
*  He does care. He has he has an interest in peace. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1359.1000000000001s)]
*  And I reckon right now out there, there are at least three Nobel [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1362.22s)]
*  prizes up for grabs. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1365.3400000000001s)]
*  And I hope that President Trump will use this term to end some wars [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1367.3400000000001s)]
*  and save some lives. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1371.1000000000001s)]
*  I hope he's I hope he's watching Zateo, because I know for a fact [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1371.98s)]
*  that he definitely does want a Nobel Peace Prize. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1375.3000000000002s)]
*  And that's the only way we're going to get him to do the right thing. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1377.3000000000002s)]
*  If there's a prize for him at the end of it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1379.6200000000001s)]
*  I reckon there's more than one out there. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1381.02s)]
*  The Trump administration claims it's working on a ceasefire deal. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1383.26s)]
*  They claim they are close. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1386.14s)]
*  We've been hearing this for a while. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1387.22s)]
*  Do you think we're close to a ceasefire? What are you hearing? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1388.66s)]
*  So we're not involved in those talks. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1391.46s)]
*  What often happens is the talks conclude and then they say to us, right. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1393.54s)]
*  600, 700 trucks tomorrow. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1396.94s)]
*  So we're ready to go. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1398.8600000000001s)]
*  The minute we get the green light to get the aid in at the scale [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1400.14s)]
*  it needs to go in, we'll go. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1402.6200000000001s)]
*  That will bring the prices down. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1403.98s)]
*  It will reduce the looting and it will stop hundreds of thousands of people [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1406.1000000000001s)]
*  from suffering from starvation. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1410.6200000000001s)]
*  Now, there's a lot of brinkmanship in all of this. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1413.02s)]
*  George Mitchell, the great peacemaker, said peacemaking is 799 days of failure [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1416.42s)]
*  and one day of success. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1421.02s)]
*  I wish them well. If they if they can get this deal done, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1423.3s)]
*  I will be celebrating and we will get those convoys moving. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1426.26s)]
*  We all will. Let's pivot a little bit. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1428.98s)]
*  You've also been involved in humanitarian efforts in Sudan, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1431.66s)]
*  where another genocide is raging. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1434.54s)]
*  What is the situation like there on the ground right now, in your view? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1436.46s)]
*  Absolutely grim. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1439.74s)]
*  So I got into I wanted to go to Darfur in my first week to make a point. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1441.02s)]
*  I spent a week in Sudan and 30 million people in need of help. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1444.62s)]
*  That's more than half the population. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1449.54s)]
*  Horrendous sexual violence. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1451.3s)]
*  I spent a lot of time talking to the survivors of sexual violence. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1453.06s)]
*  We also lose a lot of humanitarian workers in Sudan. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1456.82s)]
*  We had a convoy hit just a few days ago on the way into al-Fasher. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1458.9399999999998s)]
*  This is a convoy where I'm involved personally in negotiating [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1462.4199999999998s)]
*  access through checkpoints and what we call deconfliction, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1465.58s)]
*  which means basically don't kill us, don't bomb our convoys. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1469.26s)]
*  Doesn't seem too much to ask, but here we are asking. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1471.78s)]
*  Utterly grim situation. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1476.6200000000001s)]
*  Massive underfunding. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1478.18s)]
*  Here is elsewhere, you know, 11 percent, 12 percent funded [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1479.78s)]
*  the appeals that we have. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1483.26s)]
*  So we've got to get more visibility. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1484.86s)]
*  Once again, we have the problem that you can't get in. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1486.42s)]
*  You know, we need the international media to be in there telling that story. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1489.22s)]
*  Lis Doucet came in from the BBC with me when I when I went [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1492.58s)]
*  and told that story very effectively. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1496.02s)]
*  But we've got to find a way to reconnect with people's sense of solidarity [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1498.22s)]
*  at the moment, sense of kind. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1503.26s)]
*  I don't think that's gone away, by the way, just because of a few [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1504.8600000000001s)]
*  election results. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1507.78s)]
*  But somehow we've become more distracted, more anxious. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1509.02s)]
*  There's a bit of click bait. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1512.22s)]
*  We were overwhelmed as well. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1514.7s)]
*  But just a non-stop daily barrage. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1515.8600000000001s)]
*  It feels overwhelming, doesn't it? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1519.18s)]
*  And so I can understand why people feel that sense. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1520.66s)]
*  The world is sort of in flux, that the ground beneath us is [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1522.9s)]
*  is less stable than it should be. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1526.46s)]
*  But somehow we've got to find a way to get back to that reflex of therefore [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1529.14s)]
*  thinking we could save a hundred million. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1531.78s)]
*  We could reach a hundred million people with life saving support in the coming year. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1534.9s)]
*  Now, that is surely a mission that no one can contest. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1539.1000000000001s)]
*  And we can do that, by the way, without breaking the bank. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1543.38s)]
*  This would cost us about one percent of what the world will spend next year [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1545.7s)]
*  on arms. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1549.5400000000002s)]
*  Before I come back to Sudan, you just reminded me of one point [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1550.5400000000002s)]
*  when you said we can say how much of the USAID cuts, the massive cuts here, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1552.8999999999999s)]
*  how much that affected your work? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1557.54s)]
*  Masses, masses. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1558.9399999999998s)]
*  And I was in Kunduz, Kabul, Kandahar, Afghanistan just recently and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1560.74s)]
*  sat with women who'd lost their children because they'd had to cycle three hours [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1564.78s)]
*  to give birth to the nearest clinic, because that clinic had just been shut. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1567.9799999999998s)]
*  There was a bit of a time lag after the announcement as projects were wound down. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1572.34s)]
*  But this is enormous. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1576.54s)]
*  Forty seven percent of our appeals were funded by the US. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1577.6999999999998s)]
*  And let's be clear, US generosity, the taxpayers' generosity [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1580.9s)]
*  here in the US has saved hundreds of millions of lives over decades. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1584.6200000000001s)]
*  They have led that work. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1588.3400000000001s)]
*  But these cuts are going to cost millions of lives, according to a study in the Lancet. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1590.3400000000001s)]
*  So in the coming year, over 300 million people need our support. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1593.6200000000001s)]
*  We prioritized already 190 million people that we could reach [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1597.54s)]
*  if we got 47 billion dollars. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1601.42s)]
*  Sorry about the numbers, but, you know, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1603.06s)]
*  we're going to have to prioritize even further. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1605.38s)]
*  I think we'll reach maybe half of that number. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1607.02s)]
*  And of course, it's not just US cuts. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1609.5s)]
*  There are cuts in Europe as well among many of those traditional donors. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1612.5800000000002s)]
*  So we have to find new sources of funding. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1616.74s)]
*  And I have to reconnect somehow with people's sense of generosity and kindness [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1620.1000000000001s)]
*  and with the public and the and the voter. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1624.5400000000002s)]
*  Just returning to Sudan, the International Court of Justice just dismissed [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1627.22s)]
*  Sudan's case, accusing the UAE of arming and funding rebel groups [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1630.5s)]
*  in their civil war, saying it lacked the authority to continue the proceedings. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1634.1000000000001s)]
*  What's your response to that decision? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1637.5800000000002s)]
*  But more broadly, to the UAE, another UN member state's [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1638.86s)]
*  alleged role in all of the horrific violence and the militias in Sudan. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1642.58s)]
*  What is your message to these outs? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1646.02s)]
*  Because Sudan is a country with a lot of outside power, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1647.58s)]
*  not just the UAE, a bunch of outside powers, but the UAE has been very prominent [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1649.1s)]
*  in support of the RSF militias. What's your message? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1652.06s)]
*  So I'm in touch with all those powers who have interests in in Sudan [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1654.9799999999998s)]
*  and but also have interest in a peace process. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1659.9399999999998s)]
*  And clearly, we've got this situation where we've got to stop the arms going in. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1662.1799999999998s)]
*  We've got to we've got to get diplomacy engaged again. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1667.3s)]
*  And I'm a recovering diplomat. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1670.38s)]
*  I believe that you talk to people who disagree with on the ground, however tough. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1671.98s)]
*  And you keep going, you keep going and you keep finding people [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1675.6200000000001s)]
*  letters to climb down and ways to come to some sort of agreement. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1678.06s)]
*  I think it will need a regional role in all of that. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1681.78s)]
*  The UN role will be really important in Sudan, as in places like Syria, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1684.9s)]
*  which are in transition. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1688.98s)]
*  You know, we've got to get better at ending wars and saving lives. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1690.38s)]
*  And we can do that. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1694.1s)]
*  And Sudan is one of those places that with the right attention [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1695.3799999999999s)]
*  and patience and creativity, we can do it. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1698.6599999999999s)]
*  Many people who defend Israel often say we shouldn't be focused on Gaza. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1702.5s)]
*  We should be focused on Sudan or Yemen. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1706.02s)]
*  Those are the real humanitarian crises. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1709.06s)]
*  Why don't you talk about them? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1711.1399999999999s)]
*  They say you've heard that, I'm sure. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1712.02s)]
*  As someone who is focused on both Gaza and Sudan, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1713.98s)]
*  what is your response to that line of argument? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1717.1s)]
*  We should focus on those crises as well. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1719.1799999999998s)]
*  That's why I went to Sudan first, because it's the in terms of numbers, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1721.54s)]
*  it's the biggest on my patch right now. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1725.26s)]
*  It's why I brief the Security Council on Yemen more than on any other crisis [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1727.22s)]
*  so far, because that is a massively neglected invisible crisis. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1731.78s)]
*  The difference with Gaza is the ferocity, the intensity of the killing right now [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1737.26s)]
*  and the frustration we feel to see all that aid sat on the pallets [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1742.78s)]
*  at the border and not reaching starving people, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1748.62s)]
*  you know, 100, 200 meters on the other side of the border. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1752.18s)]
*  What would you say to people, especially activists on the ground, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1754.8999999999999s)]
*  who say the UN has failed the people of Gaza and failed the people of Sudan? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1757.18s)]
*  I think the world has failed the people of Gaza and the people of Sudan. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1761.82s)]
*  We have to stand against this era of impunity and indifference. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1765.62s)]
*  And yes, the UN as the the body that brings together the world [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1771.1s)]
*  is part of that collective failure. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1774.5s)]
*  I tell you now, though, my staff on the ground, my teams on the ground [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1776.54s)]
*  who are running those convoys, who are taking, literally taking the bullets [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1779.54s)]
*  on behalf of the world, who are effectively driving this fire engine [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1782.78s)]
*  back towards the danger to help as many survivors as possible in Sudan, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1786.26s)]
*  in Gaza, in Ukraine, in Afghanistan, in Yemen, in DRC, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1790.18s)]
*  where I'll go in the coming weeks. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1794.3s)]
*  They're not failing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1795.94s)]
*  And ultimately, it's their courage and the communities we serve on the ground [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1797.3799999999999s)]
*  that drive us on and drive us to get better and better at what we do. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1801.82s)]
*  Tom Fletcher, we'll have to leave it there. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1805.74s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me on May the Unfiltered. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1807.3s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1808.74s)]
*  Many thanks. Thank you. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG3SuQhJPP0&t=1809.3s)]
