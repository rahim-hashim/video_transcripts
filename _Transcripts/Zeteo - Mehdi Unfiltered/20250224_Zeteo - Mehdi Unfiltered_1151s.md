Video Description: Donald Trump spent his first month as president wreaking havoc on key government agencies. Shadow president Elon Musk, whose ‘DOGE’ promises to cut trillions from the federal budget, shut down USAID, but Progressives say he should start with the Pentagon’s whopping $850 billion budget.

“If you’re going to say that you’re going to deal with government waste and you’re not going to be dealing with the Pentagon, you’re just one big hypocrite,” Ben Cohen, activist and co-founder of the ice cream brand Ben & Jerry’s, tells Mehdi Hasan in a wide-ranging conversation.

They’re joined by Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist who served in Trump’s first-term State Department. “I’m all for reforms,” he says of USAID, “but you would be naive not to recognize the miracle work they do each and every day around the world.”

Watch the full video to hear Cohen and Bartlett’s opinions on whether Trump’s Gaza plan amounts to ethnic cleansing. Cohen also reveals why parent company Unilever is trying to suppress Ben & Jerry’s stance on Palestine, and Mehdi presses Bartlett on why he served in Trump’s first administration.

# ‘One Big HYPOCRITE’: Ben & Jerry’s Founder Slams Elon Musk
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ)
*  Elon Musk is busy taking over the federal government [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=0.0s)]
*  with the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=2.54s)]
*  which isn't a real department, shutting down USAID, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=4.64s)]
*  taking over key systems at the Treasury, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=7.54s)]

*  whopping $850 billion budget, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=14.98s)]
*  but can we take anything Musk says seriously, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=17.22s)]
*  given he has his own government contract, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=19.56s)]
*  specifically with the Pentagon? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  One person who's been very vocal about the need for Doge [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=23.26s)]
*  to take an axe to the Pentagon budget [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=26.3s)]
*  is progressive activist and co-founder [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=28.12s)]
*  of the ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=30.16s)]
*  yes, Ben Cohen. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=32.300000000000004s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=33.7s)]
*  And I'm also joined here in the studio [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  by Republican strategist Matthew Bartlett, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=36.1s)]
*  who served in Donald Trump's first term state department, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=38.1s)]
*  and he's also been quite vocal about Elon Musk's takeover [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=41.08s)]
*  of USAID. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=43.980000000000004s)]
*  Gentlemen, thank you both for joining me [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  on May the Unfiltered. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=46.78s)]
*  Matthew, let me start with you. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=47.88s)]
*  Elon Musk and his Doge minions have gone after USAID, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  a critical agency behind global humanitarian efforts [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=52.78s)]
*  like preventing famines and preventing the spread of HIV. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=56.24s)]
*  Trump said USAID was run by a bunch of radical lunatics, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=59.24s)]
*  and Elon Musk called it a criminal organization. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=62.92s)]
*  You worked at the State Department under Trump. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=65.62s)]
*  From your experience, what does USAID do? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=68.46s)]
*  Is it a criminal enterprise? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=72.06s)]
*  Yeah, good to be here. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=73.82s)]
*  You know, you said this town is preparing for probably [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=75.1s)]
*  some DHS raids, but now we're getting Doge raids, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=78.66s)]
*  department to department, and yes, they came into USAID. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=81.66s)]
*  A lot of, you know, maybe legitimate questions [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=84.78s)]
*  about spending over the last four years, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=88.08s)]
*  but there's also a lot of misinformation out there. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=91.16s)]
*  This was all spun up. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  And instead of reforms, they went to abolishing, to ending, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=94.4s)]
*  to scraping off the letters of USAID, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  trying to extinguish the work USAID does around the world. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=100.14s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, what do they do? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=104.74000000000001s)]
*  They do clean water. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=106.44s)]
*  They do sanitation. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=107.54s)]
*  And they work hand in hand with PEPFAR, which is our nation's. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=108.84s)]
*  20 years, our HIV AIDS treatment and prevention program. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=112.56s)]
*  So I'm all for reforms, but you would be naive not [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=116.34s)]
*  to recognize the miracle work they do each and every day [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=119.98s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=123.04s)]
*  It used to be a bipartisan issue supporting USAID. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  In fact, Marco Rubio, the current Secretary of State, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=125.88000000000001s)]
*  just a couple years ago, was saying, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=128.08s)]
*  up the budget for USAID. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  I would argue it still is a bipartisan issue. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=130.68s)]
*  Again, there may be some legitimate questions [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=134.82s)]
*  to be asked, and I would think everyone, Republican [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=137.12s)]
*  or Democrat, wants to make sure these are [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=139.7s)]
*  taxpayer dollars. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=141.68s)]
*  We are not a global charity. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=143.38s)]
*  This is not the government's work. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=145.06s)]
*  This is advancing American interests, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=146.62s)]
*  so making sure they go as far and as fast as possible. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=148.42s)]
*  But again, this notion of Doge coming in with a sledgehammer, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=152.2s)]
*  a small handful of people that is really [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=157.14s)]
*  extinguishing some of the world's greatest work [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=159.54s)]
*  to advance American interests. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=161.98s)]
*  Ben Cohen, I want to talk about the Pentagon budget with you [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=163.44s)]
*  in a moment. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=165.84s)]
*  But before we get to that, just on USAID, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=166.98s)]
*  surely as a progressive, as someone on the left, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=169.12s)]
*  you were not happy to see Doge take an ax to USAID, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=171.44s)]
*  claim it was a criminal organization, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=174.94s)]
*  and funding to clean water and sanitation, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=177.04s)]
*  everything else that Matthew just listed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=179.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I live in Vermont, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  and we have chainsaws and we have loppers. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=184.88s)]
*  And you know, when you're dealing with a tree that's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  got some disease and some dead wood, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=194.0s)]
*  you prune off the bad branches. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  You don't fucking take a chainsaw [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=198.72s)]
*  and cut the whole thing down. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=201.76s)]
*  So yeah, USAID does some excellent things. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=205.66s)]
*  You know, when we talk about totally defunding AID, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  what we're talking about is taking food out of the mouths [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=215.98s)]
*  of people that are starving and essentially killing [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=219.82s)]
*  newborn babies by getting rid of HIV treatment for their moms. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=225.18s)]
*  It's horrible what's going on. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=233.92000000000002s)]
*  Just on HIV, Matthew, you mentioned [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=236.72s)]
*  PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=238.78s)]
*  which was set up by George W. Bush. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=242.02s)]
*  You worked to reauthorize it during your time [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=244.16s)]
*  at the State Department in 2018. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=246.0s)]
*  That was a move that was passed by lawmakers in both parties. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  Trump himself vowed to eradicate HIV in 2019 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=252.18s)]
*  in the State of the Union, and now he's gutting PEPFAR. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  You said a moment ago, it is still a bipartisan issue. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  Where is the Republican Party then? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=262.06s)]
*  Where are Republican members of Congress? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=263.6s)]
*  When will they find a spine to save a program they created [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=265.2s)]
*  and they used to brag about having [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=269.34s)]
*  saved 20, 25 million lives? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=270.8s)]
*  Boy, listen, that's a great question. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=272.84s)]
*  And let's be clear, these are interesting times. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=275.14s)]
*  Yes, Donald Trump reauthorized PEPFAR. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=278.12s)]
*  He called for an end of HIV AIDS. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=280.03999999999996s)]
*  Marco Rubio, a champion of the world's poorest people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=282.0s)]
*  When that foreign policy pause went in, foreign assistance [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=285.78s)]
*  pause went in, he issued a waiver. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=288.14s)]
*  But you have external, internal forces around that Doge team [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=290.52s)]
*  that has put a freeze on USAID, on CDC. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=295.12s)]
*  They work hand in hand. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=297.76s)]
*  So that makes PEPFAR almost inoperable, not able, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  even with a waiver, to continue its lifesaving support. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  We have so many years. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=306.64s)]
*  Project 2025, everyone loves to talk about. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=307.62s)]
*  Well, why don't you go ahead and read that? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=310.04s)]
*  Because that says PEPFAR is one of the greatest successes [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=311.62s)]
*  in terms of foreign assistance. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=314.58s)]
*  I believe it's page 263. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=316.18s)]
*  Go right ahead. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=319.16s)]
*  We should continue on, not extinguish this work. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=320.46s)]
*  You've had mics over the weekend. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=322.82s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson talked about it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=324.56s)]
*  So you're telling me we got all the bad stuff from Project [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=326.1s)]
*  2025 so far, but the one good thing that was saving PEPFAR, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=328.06s)]
*  that didn't make it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=330.8s)]
*  This is almost by accident. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=331.8s)]
*  This is almost bureaucracy, where [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=334.0s)]
*  people come in and say, pump the brakes, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=336.24s)]
*  and don't fully understand how the car works. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=338.28s)]
*  And when you rip the e-brake, you're [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=340.92s)]
*  going to have a lot of maximum. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=342.52s)]
*  But that's the Doge people that you're saying, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=343.92s)]
*  Musk and his kind of teenagers. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=345.36s)]
*  But there are Republican members of Congress [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=346.71999999999997s)]
*  who were supportive of PEPFAR. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=348.46s)]
*  And then overnight, they just flipped, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=350.15999999999997s)]
*  because Trump's flipped, they flipped. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  It's pretty sad to see. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  They have not flipped on PEPFAR. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  Let's be clear. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=355.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=356.7s)]
*  Let's be thankful. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=357.5s)]
*  The secretary did a great job. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=358.46s)]
*  But what has not happened is that we have not had. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=359.84s)]
*  They flipped on USAID as a whole. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  USAID, you are right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=364.09999999999997s)]
*  There is a mix at best. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=365.54s)]
*  Speaker Mike Johnson this weekend [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=367.98s)]
*  talked about USAID having reforms, not extinguishing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=369.42s)]
*  Mike Turner, former Intel chairman, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=373.66s)]
*  he said, it is not a corrupt organization. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=375.82s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=378.1s)]
*  Let me just say, Elon Musk said, it's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=379.0s)]
*  not an apple with a worm. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=380.6s)]
*  It's a ball of worms. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=382.36s)]
*  How galling is that? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=383.36s)]
*  Because you know what USAID does? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=384.74s)]
*  It helps eradicate gimme worm. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=386.26s)]
*  This is something in the developing world [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=388.1s)]
*  where you don't have access to clean water, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=389.70000000000005s)]
*  and kids get worms. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  So let's just remember, we should not [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  abolish, we should look to fulfill. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=394.34s)]
*  Ben, we all saw the news back in November [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=397.23999999999995s)]
*  that the Pentagon failed its annual audit [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  for the seventh year in a row. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=402.08s)]
*  Couldn't fully account for the $824 billion budget. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  So we don't know where nearly $1 trillion of taxpayer money [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=407.56s)]
*  is going in total. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=410.21999999999997s)]
*  If that happened at Ben and Jerry's, that you founded, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=411.71999999999997s)]
*  someone would have been fired, would they not? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  How has the Pentagon managed to get away [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  with so much waste and alleged fraud for so many years? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=418.26s)]
*  How has it been untouchable, untouchable, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=421.29999999999995s)]
*  under administrations of both parties? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=423.6s)]
*  You know, it's worse than they can't pass an audit. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=426.8s)]
*  It's that their books are so bad [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  that they can't even attempt an order. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=432.88s)]
*  There's no paper trail in order to audit. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=435.42s)]
*  There's a law that states that every federal department [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=441.46000000000004s)]
*  must be able to be audited, must do an audit. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=446.52000000000004s)]
*  The Pentagon is the only one who has not been able [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=449.5s)]
*  to be audited, and Congress every year grants them a waiver. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=452.46s)]
*  I'll tell you, you know, if the Pentagon [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=459.94s)]
*  were a publicly-held company, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=462.58s)]
*  the executives would be in jail today. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=465.52s)]
*  So your company or your enterprise [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=468.88s)]
*  has recently launched the Doge versus Blob campaign, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=471.88s)]
*  a meme contest to highlight the biggest spenders [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=475.15999999999997s)]
*  and wasters in the Pentagon. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=478.2s)]
*  Can you talk a bit more about the contest [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=480.2s)]
*  and what you've managed to find out so far? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  Sure. It's dogevsblob.com. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=484.8s)]
*  You can go there, and you too can create a meme [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=490.4s)]
*  that explains, in normal terms, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=494.5s)]
*  how much waste is coming out of the Pentagon. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=503.18s)]
*  And, you know, we hear about the tendency [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=506.34s)]
*  to use the $10,000 toilet seat, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=511.42s)]
*  the $5,000 soap dispenser, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=514.62s)]
*  but the thing to understand is that mentality [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=518.46s)]
*  is pervasive throughout the Pentagon. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=522.7s)]
*  And when we're buying fighter jets, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  50% of them don't work, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=532.1s)]
*  and you can make your voice heard [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=536.24s)]
*  by going to dogevsblob.com [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=539.5s)]
*  and making a meme out of these crazy things. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=542.54s)]
*  I mean, you know, the thing that gets me the most [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  is the overkill. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=551.58s)]
*  You know, it's not just that they're spending [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=552.78s)]
*  $10,000 on a toilet seat, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=555.38s)]
*  it's that they're buying like 1,000 of them [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  for an aircraft carrier that only has, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=562.26s)]
*  say, 500 people on board. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=566.82s)]
*  So if you look at that in terms of nuclear weapons, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=570.36s)]
*  you know, one of them did a big job in Hiroshima. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=573.74s)]
*  The US government currently has the explosive power [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=578.54s)]
*  in our nuclear arsenal of 50,000 Hiroshimas, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=582.38s)]
*  and we're planning on spending another $2 trillion [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=587.38s)]
*  on a whole new generation of nukes. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=592.72s)]
*  So Donald Trump has talked about wanting to spend more [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=594.9200000000001s)]
*  on the military, obviously. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=597.0600000000001s)]
*  Matthew, of all people, it seems Trump ally Steve Bannon [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=598.14s)]
*  agrees with Ben and with the left [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  when it comes to Pentagon spending. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=603.0799999999999s)]
*  In a recent interview with The Times, he said, quote, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=604.28s)]
*  the defense budget is an obscenity and must be cut. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=606.38s)]
*  What do you make of that comment from Bannon? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=609.4599999999999s)]
*  Do you think there's an actual appetite amongst [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=611.26s)]
*  Magaites to cut Pentagon spending? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=613.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, welcome to populism. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=616.06s)]
*  And the thing is, it tends to be quite popular. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=617.9599999999999s)]
*  Maybe on the left and on the right. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=620.8599999999999s)]
*  I am a Republican. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=622.0s)]
*  I am a conservative. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=623.6999999999999s)]
*  I served in the first Trump State... [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=624.6999999999999s)]
*  You're more traditional. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=626.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure about that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=627.04s)]
*  So where do you stand on the Pentagon spending debate? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=628.68s)]
*  I was going to say, I remember when this used to be a debate, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=630.54s)]
*  I said whether or not we should be going to a war in Iraq. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=632.54s)]
*  And I was vehemently against that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=634.62s)]
*  Now we're talking about whether or not [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=636.12s)]
*  we should look at the Pentagon. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=637.48s)]
*  I think that's a smart idea. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=638.72s)]
*  We just talked about USAID, the crumbs on our table. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=639.98s)]
*  And 1% of the national budget. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=643.32s)]
*  Yeah, and I want that very efficiently spent. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=645.2s)]
*  But you better be looking at the drivers of the debt, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=647.9s)]
*  including Pentagon spending. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=650.0s)]
*  And Elon Musk, we talked about the downside of coming in [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=652.0s)]
*  with a sledgehammer and the world's poorest people. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=655.88s)]
*  Now he's been talking about the F-35, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=659.1800000000001s)]
*  which Ben just talked about, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=661.62s)]
*  a highly controversial program on a fighter jet. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=663.02s)]
*  So could there be some potential upside here that unites? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm from New Hampshire, he's from Vermont, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=670.22s)]
*  but unites conservatives and progressives? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  So let me be the Debbie Downer in the conversation. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=674.96s)]
*  Ben, you were very keen on the Doge mission [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=677.36s)]
*  as relates to the Pentagon. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=681.14s)]
*  And yet, what would you say to people [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=682.9000000000001s)]
*  who say, Ben, you're being a little naive. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=684.74s)]
*  This is Elon Musk, he has $15 billion in contracts [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=687.48s)]
*  from that same Pentagon. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=690.88s)]
*  There ain't no way this guy's actually really [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  gonna trim the fat there because he benefits from it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=695.02s)]
*  Well, I think if the public makes it clear [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=699.26s)]
*  that they understand what's going on, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=702.4s)]
*  that they know that this is absurd expenditures, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=705.7s)]
*  that this is a tremendous waste of money. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=709.44s)]
*  I mean, the Pentagon accounts for 50% [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=711.52s)]
*  of the entire federal discretionary budget. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=714.86s)]
*  Things like USAID and things like the Department of Education [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=719.34s)]
*  are little itsy bitsy slices. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=725.44s)]
*  So if you're gonna say that you're gonna deal [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=727.7800000000001s)]
*  with government waste and you're not gonna be dealing [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=731.24s)]
*  with the Pentagon, you're just one big hypocrite. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=736.08s)]
*  Many would say that is what Elon Musk and Donald Trump are. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=739.52s)]
*  Just switching gears, Matthew, let's talk Middle East [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=741.9200000000001s)]
*  before we run out of time. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=744.22s)]
*  In a Fox interview that aired just a couple of days ago, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=745.5600000000001s)]
*  Trump said that Palestinians would not have the right [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=748.76s)]
*  to return to Gaza after he's done his real estate deal there. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=751.76s)]
*  He said the US would take, in fact, he said, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=755.2s)]
*  I will take ownership of Gaza. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=757.2s)]
*  That's not just illegal under international law, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=759.7800000000001s)]
*  that's mad, isn't it? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=762.24s)]
*  Short answer is yes. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=763.5400000000001s)]
*  Let's just take a step back here. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=766.14s)]
*  I served in the Trump State Department [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=768.04s)]
*  where we did the hard things, where we recognized, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=769.92s)]
*  had countries that were never recognized in Israel, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=772.5799999999999s)]
*  making peace, the Abraham Accords, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=775.28s)]
*  the world was a better place. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=777.16s)]
*  You saw what happened in the last four years, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=778.68s)]
*  falling apart. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=780.72s)]
*  Like it or not, Donald Trump has an authority voice. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=781.92s)]
*  It helped. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=785.4s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=786.22s)]
*  We also watched him get laughed at at the UN [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=787.36s)]
*  while you were in the State Department. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=789.04s)]
*  Literally, when he was laughing at him. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=790.36s)]
*  Let me be clear, I am laughing at the UN, much more so. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=791.54s)]
*  I'm happy to have the results, the outcomes, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=793.9399999999999s)]
*  of the last four years, which created a better world. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=796.1s)]
*  And now we're inheriting a mess. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=798.24s)]
*  I think what you can do, he does have some trust [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=800.34s)]
*  in the region, trust with allies, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=804.58s)]
*  but it's not just what you say. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=806.44s)]
*  But not now. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=807.58s)]
*  They will come out against him, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=808.48s)]
*  because his plan is so bunkers. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=809.48s)]
*  It is more than problematic. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=810.82s)]
*  It is highly controversial, alarming to our allies [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=812.88s)]
*  in the region. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=815.6600000000001s)]
*  Let's be very, very clear. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=816.58s)]
*  It's been a horrible time in the Middle East, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=818.32s)]
*  with Israel, with hostages, with Gaza. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=820.72s)]
*  With Palestinians. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=823.58s)]
*  For a lasting peace to ever be a notion in this world [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=824.78s)]
*  that Palestinians need to have sovereignty. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=828.46s)]
*  They need to have their homeland returned to them, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=830.46s)]
*  and to have something that has come out of this. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=832.96s)]
*  I have spoken to a lot of former Trump officials on this show, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=836.0s)]
*  and when I was at MSNBC, Sarah Matthews, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=838.9s)]
*  Olivia Troy, Anthony Scaramucci, many people who've worked. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=841.2s)]
*  And I always have to ask them, and I have to ask you [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=844.14s)]
*  the same question after them. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=845.84s)]
*  How did you work for someone who was that derelict [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=847.34s)]
*  and ignorant? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=850.6999999999999s)]
*  You worked at the State Department. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=851.62s)]
*  The guy is saying nonsensical things about annexing Greenland, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=853.06s)]
*  annexing Gaza. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=856.26s)]
*  What was it like for someone clearly who's not deranged [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=857.6s)]
*  to have worked for someone like that? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=860.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is not always right, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=861.46s)]
*  and he is not always wrong. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=863.34s)]
*  And I continue. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=865.1s)]
*  It's a very polite way of saying sometimes he's not. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=866.48s)]
*  That we have. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=868.64s)]
*  I remember past presidents going to war in Iraq. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=869.9399999999999s)]
*  That seemed nuts to me. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=874.08s)]
*  I saw the last four years, when I was in the Senate, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=875.38s)]
*  that seemed nuts to me. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=878.0799999999999s)]
*  I saw the last four years where the quote unquote adults [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  were in the room, and the world fell apart on their watch. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=882.18s)]
*  I found it highly problematic, equally as disgusting, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=885.5799999999999s)]
*  to see a lack of US leadership. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=888.7199999999999s)]
*  So yeah, he is a rare bird, and if the world's going to go crazy, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=890.6199999999999s)]
*  we're America. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=895.16s)]
*  We do crazy best. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=895.9599999999999s)]
*  I love these euphemisms. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  Rare bird, problematic. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=897.7199999999999s)]
*  And it produced far better. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=899.8s)]
*  The man wants to start a war with Denmark. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=901.06s)]
*  I'm sorry? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=903.06s)]
*  He wants to start a war with Denmark. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=904.0999999999999s)]
*  Let's remember, he has not started wars. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=906.54s)]
*  He speaks in verbose ways, odd ways. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=909.18s)]
*  He's put politics in the vernacular. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=912.22s)]
*  Not everything is right. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=914.28s)]
*  Not everything is wrong. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=915.58s)]
*  Again, the notion of Gaza, the Palestinians [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=916.86s)]
*  have to remain in their land. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=919.68s)]
*  So let me ask that question to Ben Cohen. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=921.46s)]
*  Ben, you are a longtime supporter [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=923.16s)]
*  of the Palestinian cause. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=924.56s)]
*  You and I have talked about the conflict before elsewhere. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=925.82s)]
*  Do you believe what Donald Trump is proposing [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=928.7s)]
*  is ethnic cleansing? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=930.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=933.16s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=933.8s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=934.6s)]
*  I think the policy that the Biden administration had [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=936.3s)]
*  in Gaza was horrific. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=941.0799999999999s)]
*  And Trump, the real estate developer, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=944.28s)]
*  is looking at this thing and saying, wow, the demo's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=948.38s)]
*  already all done. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=951.8199999999999s)]
*  I can just go in and build my resorts. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=953.16s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=956.42s)]
*  Last year, Ben, the Ben and Jerry's independent board, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  which I know you're not on, but you're still [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=963.3599999999999s)]
*  an employee of Ben and Jerry's, I believe, and the co-founder, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=965.18s)]
*  they sued the parent company Unilever, saying Unilever had [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=968.14s)]
*  tried to prevent Ben and Jerry's from advocating [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=971.48s)]
*  for a ceasefire in Gaza, advocating [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=973.52s)]
*  for Palestinian refugees, something Unilever denies. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=975.72s)]
*  I know you're no longer in control of the company that's [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=978.36s)]
*  named after you, but did Unilever, in your view, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=980.62s)]
*  try and silence Ben and Jerry's on the issue of Palestine? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=984.02s)]
*  Yes, they absolutely did. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=988.5s)]
*  It was a, it was a, they usurped the power [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=992.26s)]
*  of the independent board of directors, and they got sued. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=999.0999999999999s)]
*  And they should have been sued. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1005.4799999999999s)]
*  As someone who is a lover of chocolate therapy ice cream [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1007.88s)]
*  from Ben and Jerry's, I have to ask, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1010.4799999999999s)]
*  what is the future of the company then? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1011.92s)]
*  Is it going to split from Unilever, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1013.52s)]
*  separate to this lawsuit? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1014.92s)]
*  Well, you know, Unilever has announced [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1017.28s)]
*  that they want to sell their entire ice cream division, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1019.78s)]
*  and they weren't able to do that, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1023.3199999999999s)]
*  but they've decided now to spin it off [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1024.92s)]
*  into a separate publicly held company. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1027.42s)]
*  They have over 20 brands of ice cream around the world. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1030.7s)]
*  And you know, Jerry and I have been thinking that, well, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1034.1s)]
*  as long as Unilever is looking to get rid of it, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1038.1s)]
*  why don't we find some person who's socially aligned, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1040.44s)]
*  or some group of people, or some entity, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1044.94s)]
*  to buy just Ben and Jerry's? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1047.7s)]
*  That's what we would like to have happen, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1050.5s)]
*  and then we wouldn't have to deal with the problems [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1052.74s)]
*  with the independent board versus an owner [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1055.64s)]
*  that doesn't really share the values. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1058.3400000000001s)]
*  Intriguing. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1060.64s)]

*  Matthew Bartlett, before we finish, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1063.64s)]
*  I believe you resigned from the Trump State Department [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1065.74s)]
*  in January 2021 because of the January 6th insurrection. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1067.7800000000002s)]
*  What has been your response to seeing Donald Trump, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1071.8600000000001s)]
*  the rare bird, as you call him, pardoning rioters, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1074.38s)]
*  calling them patriots, political prisoners? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1077.3s)]
*  He said in his Fox interview a few days ago [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1079.2s)]
*  that they were the ones who assaulted the government. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1081.88s)]
*  Sorry, they were the ones who were assaulted by the government. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1084.32s)]
*  They didn't assault any first responders. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1086.32s)]
*  What's your reaction when you hear comments like that? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1088.22s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, listen, I did resign January 6th. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1090.02s)]
*  It was a very important day for me. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1093.06s)]
*  I saw the breakdown, not just at the Capitol, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1094.8600000000001s)]
*  all over society. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1097.66s)]
*  I don't think that behavior should be tolerated, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1098.8600000000001s)]
*  and if it's criminal, you should be prosecuted. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1100.66s)]
*  So when you pardon people like that, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1102.5s)]
*  again, being honest with you, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1104.8000000000002s)]
*  being intellectually honest with myself, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1106.5s)]
*  vehemently disagree with, highly problematic, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1108.24s)]
*  setting a standard that should not be set. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1111.14s)]
*  This is America. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1113.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, I think it's a travesty that that happened. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1115.0400000000002s)]
*  I have a lot of problems with both parties, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1117.48s)]
*  with both presidents' pardons actions, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1119.94s)]
*  but yeah, that was highly, highly problematic. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1122.42s)]
*  We will have to leave it there. Matthew Bartlett, Ben Cohen, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcA3kYqUZWQ&t=1126.38s)]
