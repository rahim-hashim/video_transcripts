# Project 2025: Mehdi Hasan Debunks Trump’s ‘Desperate’ Denial Of It
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [July 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc)
*  If you're following the U.S. presidential election right now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=0.0s)]
*  you'll see that people are focused on one story [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  and one story only at this moment, Biden's age, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=5.32s)]
*  his memory, his mental competence. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=8.16s)]
*  And those people include me, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=10.32s)]
*  because I think Biden's age and mental health is, sorry, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=12.32s)]
*  an undeniable political problem for him, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=15.08s)]
*  and he should probably stand aside [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  and let someone else run as the Democratic nominee. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=18.72s)]
*  Having said that, any conversation about the mental health [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=20.92s)]
*  of the president has to include the president's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=24.0s)]
*  Republican opponent, the uniquely incoherent [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=26.32s)]
*  and many would say deranged Donald Trump. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=29.16s)]
*  You think Biden is losing it? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  Biden is forgetting things? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=33.96s)]
*  Have you seen the ridiculous things Trump has been saying? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=35.56s)]
*  He didn't just wrongly say at a rally the other day [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  that his son, Don Jr., is married, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  even though Don Jr. isn't married, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=42.8s)]
*  but more importantly, more consequentially, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump shared this deluded claim on Truth Social the other week, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=46.88s)]
*  claiming that he knows nothing about the controversial [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=50.52s)]
*  Project 2025 and that he has nothing to do [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=52.96s)]
*  with the people behind it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=55.6s)]
*  Now, for those of you who don't know, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=57.12s)]
*  Project 2025 is a dangerous far-right policy agenda [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=58.68s)]
*  that calls for a major expansion of presidential powers [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=62.36s)]
*  and a total overhaul of our checks and balances. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=65.48s)]
*  The 920-page policy book at the heart of it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=68.08s)]
*  details plans for the president to enact mass deportation, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=71.32s)]
*  eliminate the Department of Education, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=74.88s)]
*  further restrict abortion rights, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=76.56s)]
*  replace federal workers with MAGA loyalists en masse, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=78.28s)]
*  and a whole host of other pretty fascistic goals [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=81.72s)]
*  that completely coincidentally line up pretty closely [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=84.68s)]
*  with the policy agenda that Trump himself has been touting. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=87.64s)]
*  Project 2025 was created by the Heritage Foundation, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=90.72s)]
*  a conservative think tank that actually partnered with Trump [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=93.56s)]
*  while he was in the White House. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=96.56s)]
*  But now, Trump suddenly can't seem to remember [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=98.04s)]
*  that close alliance. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=100.76s)]
*  New phone. Who dis? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=102.04s)]
*  Luckily, though, no matter how jumbled his memory might get, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=104.04s)]
*  the internet never forgets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=106.52s)]
*  Just take a look here at Trump in 2017 [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=108.44s)]
*  promoting his tax plan at... [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=111.16s)]
*  Wait for it. The Heritage Foundation. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=113.76s)]
*  And the dedicated scholars and staff [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=116.6s)]
*  at the Heritage Foundation, thank you very much. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=119.48s)]
*  Thank you. Great job. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=122.72s)]
*  Does that ring a bell, Donald? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=124.72s)]
*  No? Well, don't worry. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  I know your memory isn't what it used to be. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=128.12s)]
*  So let me be a little bit more specific today [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=130.16s)]
*  and remind you who those Project 2025 people are. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=132.36s)]
*  Let's start off with Kevin Roberts, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=135.32s)]
*  the president of the Heritage Foundation. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=136.84s)]
*  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=139.6s)]
*  Yes, the one you gushed over two years ago [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=145.2s)]
*  during your keynote address at the Heritage Foundation, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=147.76s)]
*  his organisation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=150.88s)]
*  I want to thank Kevin. He's going to be so incredible. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  I know that for a fact. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=154.79999999999998s)]
*  Aw, how kind. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  You'll be proud to know that incredible Kevin [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=158.56s)]
*  actually wrote the full word for Project 2025. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=161.24s)]
*  Now, to be fair, there are a lot of conservative organisations [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=165.64s)]
*  you can't remember them all, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  but surely you remember all the Project 2025 people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  who have literally worked for you, right? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  140 people in total, according to CNN. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=176.32s)]
*  People like Carolyn Leavitt, your campaign press secretary, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=179.2s)]
*  the one who caused quite the stir on CNN [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  before the debate on their network, the one you agreed to. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=184.83999999999997s)]
*  She herself is in a promotional video for Project 2025, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=188.04s)]
*  your campaign press secretary. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=192.16s)]
*  Then there's your loyal former White House senior adviser, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=194.16s)]
*  who fiercely dedicated himself to the shameless promotion [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=197.6s)]
*  of all of your lies. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=200.64s)]
*  And I'm prepared to go on any show, anywhere, any time, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=202.11999999999998s)]
*  and repeat it and say the President of the United States [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=205.48s)]
*  is correct 100%. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=207.55999999999997s)]
*  Yes, that's Stephen. Well, guess what? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  He's also in the same Project 2025 commercial [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  that Caroline is in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=216.32s)]
*  What a small world. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, of course, you two are just so in tune with each other [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=219.48s)]
*  that Stephen's actually been mimicking you by saying [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=222.32s)]
*  He has no involvement with Project 2025 either. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=224.76s)]
*  But unfortunately, you two really do seem to learn [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=228.27999999999997s)]
*  from each other when it comes to bad lying, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=230.44s)]
*  because not only is Miller's organisation, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  America First Legal, a part of the Project 2025 advisory board, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=234.72s)]
*  but Stephen also has the Project 2025 Mandate for Leadership book [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=239.72s)]
*  right next to him in that commercial. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh, and on the topic of bad lies, you remember Ben Carson, right? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=246.64s)]
*  Your housing and urban development secretary? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=250.76s)]
*  Because Chapter 15 of Project 2025 is authored by Carson himself. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  There's also Russ Vogt, who wrote Chapter 2 of Project 2025. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=258.24s)]
*  Not only is he currently in charge of the Republican Party's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=262.08s)]
*  Platform Committee, aka writing your current 2024 GOP platform, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=264.8s)]
*  but he was also your director of the Office of Management and Budget, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=270.84s)]
*  back in your White House days. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=274.12s)]
*  I would like to now invite Acting Director of OMB, Russ Vogt, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=276.28s)]
*  to say a few words about the exciting news, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=280.92s)]
*  and I want to thank Russ for doing an incredible job. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=283.68s)]
*  And Russ could be your next White House Chief of Staff, too, apparently. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=287.0s)]
*  But you don't know him? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=291.72s)]
*  Now, who else, Donald? Who else? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, you have Peter Navarro, your old deputy assistant [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=296.44s)]
*  in the White House, who went to prison for refusing to testify [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  in front of the January 6 Committee, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=301.64s)]
*  but still managed to write Chapter 26 of Project 2025. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=303.6s)]
*  Paul Danz, who was Chief of Staff at your Office of Personnel Management. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=307.44s)]
*  He's the director for Project 2025, the whole damn thing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=310.96s)]
*  Gene Hamilton, a top aide in your Department of Justice, wrote Chapter 17. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=314.32s)]
*  Mandy Gunasakara, your old Chief of Staff at the EPA, wrote Chapter 13. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=318.12s)]
*  John McEntee, one of your closest aides in the White House, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=322.28s)]
*  he was your body man, is a senior adviser to Project 2025. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=324.79999999999995s)]
*  I could keep going, the list goes on and on, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=328.67999999999995s)]
*  but I'm a little worried I might put you to sleep again, Donald. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=331.84s)]
*  Look, jokes and snark aside, how does someone just suddenly forget [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=335.48s)]
*  many of their own current and former employees and advisers? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=339.8s)]
*  Is it possible that Trump may need to take a cognitive test again? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=343.08000000000004s)]
*  Like you'll go person, woman, man, camera, TV. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  Look, as much as Trump talking about his cognitive tests amuses me, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  all this Project 2025 denial is actually not an example [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=359.24s)]
*  of Trump's dangerous delusions and derangement, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=363.0s)]
*  but rather his dangerous and desperate dishonesty. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=365.96s)]
*  Because when it comes to Project 2025, which proposes authoritarian [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=369.03999999999996s)]
*  and reactionary and ridiculous things that are hugely unpopular [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=373.32s)]
*  with most ordinary Americans, it seems clear to me that Trump's not [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  forgetting about his closeness to it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=380.68s)]
*  He's just plain lying. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z3WdDbwNmc&t=383.24s)]
