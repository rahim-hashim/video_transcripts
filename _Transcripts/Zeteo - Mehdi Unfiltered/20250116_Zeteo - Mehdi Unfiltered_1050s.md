# Say Goodbye To Junk Fees And Pesky Subscriptions. What The FTC’s Wins Mean For You.
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs)
*  She was 32 years old when she was appointed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=0.0s)]
*  the youngest ever chair of the Federal Trade Commission, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=2.04s)]
*  the FTC, by President Biden in the summer of 2021. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=4.24s)]
*  But Columbia law professor and antitrust crusader, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=8.16s)]
*  Lena Kahn, didn't hold back once she was appointed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=10.68s)]
*  over the past three and a half years. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=13.4s)]
*  She's taken on the likes of Google, Amazon, Meta, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=14.92s)]
*  and Microsoft and helped bolster [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=17.52s)]
*  the Biden administration's populist credentials [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=19.44s)]
*  with new rules on everything from getting rid of junk fees [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=22.16s)]
*  to making it easier to cancel your subscriptions. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=24.72s)]
*  She's won praise even from some big name Republicans [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=27.56s)]
*  in Congress in the process, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=30.36s)]
*  but she's also made a lot of enemies [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=32.68s)]
*  and boardrooms across corporate America. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=34.24s)]
*  And Donald Trump is now planning on replacing her [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=36.64s)]
*  as FTC chair. Surprise! [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=38.84s)]
*  So what does she make of what's coming down the line [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=41.8s)]
*  and how does she define her own legacy? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Joining me now for an exclusive interview [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  with Mehedi Unfiltered is the outgoing FTC chair, Lena Kahn. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Lena, thanks so much for joining me on the show. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=52.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=55.36s)]
*  Under your leadership, Lena, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=56.76s)]
*  the Federal Trade Commission has gotten rid of junk fees, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=58.08s)]
*  made it easy to cancel subscriptions, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=60.28s)]
*  worked to lower drug prices, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=62.16s)]
*  struck down a recent merger [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  that would have raised the price of groceries. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=65.68s)]
*  I mean, the list goes on and on. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=67.8s)]
*  You've done a lot in a short space of time, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=69.12s)]
*  but I just wonder, how do you see your accomplishments [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=71.64s)]
*  impacting on the everyday lives of ordinary Americans? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=74.32s)]
*  What do you think the highlight has been? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=77.32s)]
*  What would you like your legacy at the FTC to be? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=79.24s)]
*  At its core, the FTC's job is to promote fair, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=83.12s)]
*  honest, and competitive markets. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=86.84s)]
*  We've done that job faithfully and vigorously. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=89.0s)]
*  We've won big victories in court, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=92.48s)]
*  and we have materially made life better for the American people [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  from bringing down the cost of asthma inhalers [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  and other drugs to taking on junk fees [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  by major corporate landlords [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=104.68s)]
*  to blocking a major grocery merger [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=106.72s)]
*  that would have led to higher prices and worse jobs, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=108.72s)]
*  to making it much easier to cancel a subscription. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=111.72s)]
*  And I think if you step back, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=115.12s)]
*  the FTC has really demonstrated to the American people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=117.2s)]
*  what it looks like when a government agency [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=120.24s)]
*  is fully serving the people and fully in their corner, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=122.72s)]
*  even when it means taking on powerful vested interests [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=125.88s)]
*  and law-breaking corporations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=130.0s)]
*  As someone who's just founded a subscription business, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=132.4s)]
*  I'm sad about the subscription rule. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=134.44s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=135.8s)]
*  I know you've held open commission meetings. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=137.2s)]
*  You've travelled across the country to hear from Americans [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=141.08s)]
*  directly from all walks of life. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  What are you hearing from them? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=145.12s)]
*  What do you think the issues that matter to everyday Americans [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=146.56s)]
*  are that the FTC deals with? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=149.8s)]
*  Because we're often told that the average American [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  is actually small-c conservative on issues related to the economy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=153.28s)]
*  They're very free market, they're very low tax. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=156.68s)]
*  Is that what you hear? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=159.44s)]
*  So you're absolutely right that I made it a priority [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=162.08s)]
*  to make sure we were opening our doors [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=164.64000000000001s)]
*  and hearing from Americans all across the country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=167.0s)]
*  It's very easy in these types of jobs to become very insulated [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=170.48s)]
*  and just hear from a very small number of constituencies. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  I travelled to places like, you know, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=178.88s)]
*  Baraboo, Wisconsin, to Ames, Iowa, to Silicon Valley, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=181.44s)]
*  I mean, really just all across. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  And what I heard was a real concern [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  about lack of fairness in the marketplace. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=190.28s)]
*  I think all too often people feel like [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=193.6s)]
*  they're not getting a fair shake [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=195.32s)]
*  just in their day-to-day economic transactions. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=197.64s)]
*  And a lot of the work that the FTC has done [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=200.88s)]
*  has been about making sure that we are taking on [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=203.68s)]
*  some of those daily indignities, be it the junk fees, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=206.4s)]
*  be it the higher prices and worse jobs [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=210.0s)]
*  because of extreme consolidation. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=212.56s)]
*  You're absolutely right that questions of monopoly power [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=214.64s)]
*  and extreme concentration of economic power [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=217.88s)]
*  is not a partisan issue. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=221.0s)]
*  I mean, I think there is deep concerns on both sides of the aisle. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=222.88s)]
*  And I would get handwritten letters from people [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  who would say things like, I'm a lifelong Republican, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=229.16s)]
*  but the FTC's work to eliminate non-compete clauses [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=232.56s)]
*  is by far the best thing that the government [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  has ever done in my lifetime. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  So I think the work that the agency has been doing [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  has enormous public support, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  and we've seen that in countless ways. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=245.72s)]
*  I'm guessing you were better received in Ames, Iowa, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=248.44s)]
*  than in Silicon Valley. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=251.16s)]
*  What is it about antitrust that you think big corporations [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=252.67999999999998s)]
*  and tech corporations, for example, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=256.44s)]
*  the CEOs of those corporations who don't tend to be fans of yours, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=258.36s)]
*  what is it that they don't get in your view? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=262.04s)]
*  How does going to court, for example, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=264.8s)]
*  to stop grocery chain Kroger's from acquiring rival Albertsons, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=266.6s)]
*  which you successfully did in court just last month, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=270.48s)]
*  how does that help consumers and help workers in your view? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=273.2s)]
*  So the premise underlying our antitrust laws [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=278.52s)]
*  is that it's fair competition that is best for Americans [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=281.56s)]
*  rather than extreme monopolization or consolidation [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=286.12s)]
*  or centralization of markets. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=289.92s)]
*  Right? I mean, we've had an economy [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  that has been delivered enormous benefits to people [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=294.04s)]
*  when firms, even big firms, even incumbent firms, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=297.2s)]
*  are having to look over their shoulder and see, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=300.64s)]
*  am I about to get lapped? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=303.24s)]
*  And does that mean I need to go even faster? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=304.68s)]
*  I need to deliver even better prices. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  I need to deliver better quality. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=309.2s)]
*  I need to deliver better jobs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=310.8s)]
*  And it's true that monopolies and some incumbents [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=312.68s)]
*  would rather keep that competition out, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=315.92s)]
*  would rather shut those rivals out of the market. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  But the whole premise of our antitrust laws [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=321.2s)]
*  is that actually the best ideas should win [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=323.2s)]
*  and gatekeepers should not just be able [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=326.04s)]
*  to lock in their dominance. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=328.0s)]
*  And we've seen time and time again, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=329.88s)]
*  extreme consolidation means that people are having to drive [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  500 miles or 100 miles to go to the hospital [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  rather than five miles. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=338.40000000000003s)]
*  It means people are paying more for healthcare, for groceries. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=340.32s)]
*  And it can even lead to major disasters [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=344.28s)]
*  like extreme consolidation in airspace manufacturing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=347.11999999999995s)]
*  that leaves the US vulnerable. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  Back in October, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=353.4s)]
*  released a report on your leadership of the FTC. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=355.96s)]
*  And that report says, quote, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=358.76s)]
*  its singular purpose is to impose left-wing ideology [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  over American markets and companies, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=363.11999999999995s)]
*  disregarding American consumers [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=364.96s)]
*  and mirroring the European models [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  that the QAn FTC strives to imitate. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=368.84s)]
*  What did you make of that statement? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=372.08s)]
*  Well, look, I think our record speaks for itself. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=375.28s)]
*  I think all the ways that we are delivering enormous benefits [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  for the American people speaks for itself. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=380.47999999999996s)]
*  And I'm just enormously proud of the just win after win [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=383.52s)]
*  that we've been able to deliver for the American people, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=387.4s)]
*  be it in court, be it in advancing the law, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=389.84s)]
*  be it in money that we're saving for people, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=392.88s)]
*  be it in non-competes that have been dropped [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=394.88s)]
*  for thousands of workers. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=397.0s)]
*  And so it's just been an honor to get to be in this role [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=399.08s)]
*  and very proud of what we've been able to deliver. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  And the relatively short time that we've had. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=403.6s)]
*  But just sticking with the issue of partisanship, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=405.68s)]
*  because a lot of Republicans don't like you, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=407.40000000000003s)]
*  some do, but a lot don't. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=408.76000000000005s)]
*  You mentioned a moment ago [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=411.24s)]
*  that there's nothing intrinsically partisan [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  or progressive about antitrust laws, anti-monopoly laws. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  It shouldn't be. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=418.48s)]
*  It should be something that people [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  across the political divide support. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=420.16s)]
*  Obviously, antitrust is about making the free market work [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=422.52000000000004s)]
*  in a fairer way, as you explained. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=425.16s)]
*  Do you see yourself as a capitalist [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=426.88s)]
*  or as someone more on the left, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=429.16s)]
*  someone more of a social Democrat? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, look, capitalism, we have open, fair, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=434.6s)]
*  competitive markets. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  That's the system that we have. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  Those are the markets that our antitrust laws [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=440.84000000000003s)]
*  are supposed to protect. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  And so absolutely, I mean, I think competition [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=445.04s)]
*  is the lifeblood of our capitalist system. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=447.28000000000003s)]
*  And those are the laws that we at the FTC enforce. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=449.64000000000004s)]
*  So it's not just Republicans who have come after you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  Some liberals and centrists haven't been too happy [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=455.8s)]
*  with how you've run the FTC. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=458.12s)]
*  And Kush Kudori wrote in New York Magazine [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=459.72s)]
*  at the end of 2023, quote, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=462.0s)]
*  "'Things have not gone as planned [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=463.68s)]
*  for the movement of the once rising star [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  who has suffered a series of conspicuous setbacks [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=467.52s)]
*  at the helm of the FTC this year." [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=470.08s)]
*  2023. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=471.96s)]
*  He pointed out at the time to your lawsuits [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=472.88s)]
*  against Metta and Microsoft having, quote, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=474.64s)]
*  flopped in the court. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  You a moment ago mentioned the non-compete ruling [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=478.15999999999997s)]
*  that was welcomed by a lot of people, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=480.79999999999995s)]
*  but now has been, I believe, suspended by a judge. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=482.28s)]
*  What do you say to people who say, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=485.67999999999995s)]
*  well, you haven't as been as effective as you say? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=487.28s)]
*  Well, we at the FTC have had just historic wins. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=490.36s)]
*  I mean, it's really remarkable to look at the last few years [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=494.36s)]
*  and just see enormous ways [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=497.44s)]
*  that we've been able to shift the law. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=500.08s)]
*  We've litigated five murder trials in the last year alone, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=502.08s)]
*  which is a record. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=505.92s)]
*  We've already won four of those. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=507.48s)]
*  We're waiting for a fifth decision. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=509.2s)]
*  And these are not just small ball cases. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, these are cases that are going after [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=515.2s)]
*  some of the biggest mergers, the biggest deals in our economy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=518.44s)]
*  We're putting forward arguments that candidly enforcers [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=523.24s)]
*  in the past sometimes shied away from. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=526.2s)]
*  And we have resoundingly won. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=528.6800000000001s)]
*  I mean, we just issued these new merger guidelines a year ago. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=530.8800000000001s)]
*  They've already been cited as persuasive authority [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=534.44s)]
*  by over a dozen courts. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=536.96s)]
*  And I think if you hear some of the chatter on Wall Street [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=539.6400000000001s)]
*  and by deal makers, they've certainly noticed [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=542.72s)]
*  how effective the FTC has been. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=545.4s)]
*  You've gone off to Amazon and Metta, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=547.4s)]
*  and yet Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  right now, cozying up to Donald Trump, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=552.48s)]
*  the day we're speaking, Mark Zuckerberg has just put out a video [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  saying he's going to change all of Metta's content policies [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=556.92s)]
*  to align with Republican ways of seeing it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=559.72s)]
*  They've donated to his inauguration fund as well. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=562.16s)]
*  How do you think their behaviour right now since the election [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  will weigh on the FTC as we start a second Trump term? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=568.6s)]
*  Do you think these tech giants will be scrutinized [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=573.12s)]
*  to the same degree going forward? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=576.36s)]
*  Well, look, I can't predict [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=579.8s)]
*  what a future administration is going to do. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=580.96s)]
*  I do know that one of the original insights [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=583.32s)]
*  underlying the antitrust laws [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=585.76s)]
*  and the anti-monopoly tradition in America [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=587.56s)]
*  was a recognition that deep concentrations of economic power [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=590.12s)]
*  would be dangerous for the American people. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=594.44s)]
*  It would undermine their economic freedoms, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=596.84s)]
*  but it could also pose political dangers. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=599.12s)]
*  And I think too often, Americans realize [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=602.12s)]
*  that extreme concentration of economic power [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=604.88s)]
*  can buy you political power in ways that people view as, you know, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=607.8399999999999s)]
*  unseemly and not really how our system is supposed to work. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=612.52s)]
*  The FTC has been successful in its litigations [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=616.56s)]
*  against Facebook and Amazon. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=619.56s)]
*  Those are set to go to trial in the coming years. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=621.1999999999999s)]
*  And as I've noted, I think it's in those companies' interests [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=624.56s)]
*  to try to come and get some type of cheap settlement, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=627.12s)]
*  but I think it's in the interest of the American people [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=630.88s)]
*  for those cases to go to trial [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=632.96s)]
*  and for us to get those liability verdicts. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=634.76s)]
*  So you're not going to be the chair of the FTC going forward. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=637.12s)]
*  Donald Trump is president from January the 20th. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=640.52s)]
*  He's picked your fellow commissioner, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=643.12s)]
*  current commissioner Andrew Ferguson, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=645.04s)]
*  a conservative to be the new chair [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=647.24s)]
*  of the Federal Trade Commission. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=648.92s)]
*  Ferguson was appointed in April of last year. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=650.64s)]
*  He's dissented against some of your most popular policies, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=653.12s)]
*  the ones you've been mentioning in this interview, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=656.36s)]
*  like banning non-compete, cracking down on junk fees. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=657.76s)]
*  He said that he's going to fight wokeness [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=661.0s)]
*  and fight back against the trans agenda. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=663.28s)]
*  Do you worry that a lot of your good work, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=665.72s)]
*  the popular work you cited in this conversation of ours, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=667.44s)]
*  that's going to be undone by your Republican successor? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=670.0s)]
*  Sounds like it will be. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=672.28s)]
*  Well, look, I can't speak to what his plans are, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=674.6800000000001s)]
*  and, you know, folks will have to ask him directly. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=676.84s)]
*  I do think that a lot of the wins that we've achieved [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=680.88s)]
*  for the American people will be durable. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=683.12s)]
*  Many of the rules that we finalized [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=685.88s)]
*  have already gotten into place, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=687.64s)]
*  including a rule that banishes fake reviews. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=689.4s)]
*  Our click to cancel rule is set to go into effect [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=692.8s)]
*  January 14th, and companies will have until mid-May [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=696.0s)]
*  to come into full compliance. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=699.16s)]
*  And the litigated wins that we've already gotten [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=701.4s)]
*  are not going away, and they make clear that [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=703.52s)]
*  if in the future enforcers wanna retreat [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=706.08s)]
*  and wanna really go soft on taking on corporate lawbreakers, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=710.12s)]
*  that's not because of anything that's happening [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=714.36s)]
*  in the courts or the law. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=716.76s)]
*  It's actually gonna be in direct contravention [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=718.12s)]
*  to what the law mandates. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=720.6s)]
*  So, you know, these will be decisions [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=722.12s)]
*  that future enforcers will have to make. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=724.4s)]
*  But clearly he's gonna take it in a different direction. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=726.08s)]
*  That's undeniable. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=728.52s)]
*  Well, look, of course, every chair comes in [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=731.12s)]
*  with their own policies and their own priorities. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=732.76s)]
*  I do think one thing that's especially striking [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=736.16s)]
*  about the antitrust and the anti-monopoly work is, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=738.64s)]
*  as you've noted, there is deep bipartisan concern [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=741.76s)]
*  about extreme concentration of private power [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=745.4s)]
*  and what it means for a handful of companies [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  to get to pick and choose, for example, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=751.0s)]
*  who is getting seen and heard in the digital sphere. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=753.1600000000001s)]
*  I think there's a lot of concern about, you know, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=757.0s)]
*  people's healthcare, and so these concerns [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  are not going away. So on that note, Lena, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=761.6s)]
*  on that note about partisanship, here's what I don't get. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=762.9200000000001s)]
*  Vice President-elect JD Vance called you [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=766.2s)]
*  one of the few people in the Biden administration [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=768.2s)]
*  who I think is doing a pretty good job. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=770.48s)]
*  Former GOP congressman Matt Gaetz, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=772.5200000000001s)]
*  who Trump originally wanted as his attorney general, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=774.24s)]
*  said, I hope her work continues in the Trump administration. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=776.6800000000001s)]
*  And you yourself welcomed their praise for your work, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=780.84s)]
*  and yet not only are they getting rid of you, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=783.5200000000001s)]
*  the guy they're replacing doesn't share any of your views, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=786.24s)]
*  the views that seem to endear you [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=790.0400000000001s)]
*  to the likes of Matt Gaetz and JD Vance. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=792.08s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=794.6400000000001s)]
*  Why aren't Trump and Vance keeping you on then, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=795.5600000000001s)]
*  if they agree with you? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=798.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, look, it's, you know, very traditional [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=801.12s)]
*  for a new president, especially of a different party [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=803.96s)]
*  to come in and select their own political appointees. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  And you've probably noticed that there is a big debate [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=810.8800000000001s)]
*  happening in the Republican Party [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=813.0s)]
*  about how to think about corporate power, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=817.2800000000001s)]
*  whether we really want an approach [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=820.08s)]
*  that's coddling monopolies [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=821.8000000000001s)]
*  and encouraging extreme consolidation of corporate power, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=823.9200000000001s)]
*  or instead, whether we want strong cops on the beat [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=828.64s)]
*  that are taking corporate lawbreakers to court, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=831.4s)]
*  holding them accountable [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=835.04s)]
*  and protecting the American people from monopoly power. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=836.16s)]
*  So that's a debate that's happening right now in real time. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=838.8399999999999s)]
*  The Vances and Gaetzes seem to be losing it [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=842.1999999999999s)]
*  because Andrew Ferguson has taken over from you. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=844.0s)]
*  But it's not just the Republicans [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=846.12s)]
*  who decided to kind of distance themselves from you. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=847.56s)]
*  It feels like you were abandoned by your own side too. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=850.4s)]
*  I mean, I saw you doing events with AOC [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=852.68s)]
*  during the presidential campaign in New York, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=855.12s)]
*  but you were nowhere to be seen [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=857.44s)]
*  when it came to the Harris campaign. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=859.44s)]
*  And the vice president had as her major media proxy [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=860.84s)]
*  on economic issues, billionaire Mark Cuban, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=863.96s)]
*  who went out and said he wouldn't keep you on as FTC chair [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=866.76s)]
*  if he was president. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=869.88s)]
*  And he said, the bigger picture is she's hurting [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=870.88s)]
*  more than she's helping. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=873.72s)]
*  Do you feel like the Harris campaign undermined you? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=875.24s)]
*  My job is a law enforcer. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=879.64s)]
*  You know, there are laws that prohibit people [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  in my type of position to even be campaigning [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=884.16s)]
*  or be appearing in political campaigns. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=886.88s)]
*  So I've been focused on enforcing the law [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=888.88s)]
*  without fear or favor. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=891.2s)]
*  Sure, so when we get invited to do constituent events, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=893.24s)]
*  to meet with the constituents of members of Congress, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=896.28s)]
*  you know, that's always something that we do. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=899.4s)]
*  But our job is not to kind of, you know, help campaigns. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=901.04s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you know, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=907.04s)]
*  my job is to listen to the American people [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=908.4s)]
*  and to enforce the law without fear or favor. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=910.8s)]
*  We've been doing that, including from listening [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=914.72s)]
*  to Americans across the country. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=916.64s)]
*  Congress has charged the FTC with enforcing the law [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=918.92s)]
*  in the, you know, without fear or favor, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=922.16s)]
*  and that's what we've been doing. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=924.68s)]
*  Just for the record, did the Harris campaign, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=926.48s)]
*  did the vice president reach out to you at all [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=928.92s)]
*  during the campaign to bolster your work [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=930.88s)]
*  or use any of your achievements that you've told me about [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  today in their campaigning? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=936.0s)]
*  Well, look, in my capacity as FTC chair, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=938.8s)]
*  of course we've met with the vice president [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=941.08s)]
*  and have shared with her, you know, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=943.12s)]
*  parts of our work that she has helped lead on. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=944.5999999999999s)]
*  But we, as enforcers, as law enforcers, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=947.76s)]
*  we're not involved in campaigning [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=951.1199999999999s)]
*  because that would violate the law. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  One last question. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=954.8s)]
*  You can continue to serve the FTC as a commissioner [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=955.68s)]
*  until I believe the Senate confirms new appointees, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=958.68s)]
*  which could take months, of course. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=961.1199999999999s)]
*  I believe there aren't any laws requiring you to resign [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=963.0s)]
*  when the Trump administration takes over. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=965.5999999999999s)]
*  Are you considering staying on at the FTC as a commissioner, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=967.8399999999999s)]
*  if not the chair, after January the 20th? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=970.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, look, my focus right now [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=974.88s)]
*  is on the time that I have left as chair. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=976.16s)]
*  We have eight more business days, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=978.1999999999999s)]
*  and we're going to use those days to keep protecting the public [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=979.76s)]
*  from illegal business practices. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=982.76s)]
*  As you've noted, the president-elect [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=985.0799999999999s)]
*  has not only designated a new chair, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=986.5999999999999s)]
*  but announced his intention to nominate my replacement. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=988.5999999999999s)]
*  And so my time at the commission will be winding down. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=991.68s)]
*  And right now, we're just focused on the next eight days [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=994.7199999999999s)]
*  and getting as much out as we can. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=997.4799999999999s)]
*  But January 21st, is Lina Khan on the FTC or not on the FTC? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=999.16s)]
*  It's only 13 days away. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1002.3599999999999s)]
*  Look, right now, we're just thinking through, you know, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1003.8399999999999s)]
*  until the morning of the 20th, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  and my time at the FTC will be coming to an end. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1007.64s)]
*  That's a great political answer, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1010.68s)]
*  which makes me now add a last question on and say, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1011.88s)]
*  do you have ambitions of running for political office [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  at some point, elected office? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1016.0s)]
*  You know, it's been an honor to be at the FTC [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1018.9599999999999s)]
*  and enforce the law without fear or favor [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1021.9599999999999s)]
*  and, you know, just thinking about the rest of my time here. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1024.56s)]
*  It's a very good politician answer. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1028.52s)]
*  Lina Khan, thank you so much for your time. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1029.9199999999998s)]
*  Appreciate you taking my questions. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clvu1UaSzEs&t=1032.08s)]
