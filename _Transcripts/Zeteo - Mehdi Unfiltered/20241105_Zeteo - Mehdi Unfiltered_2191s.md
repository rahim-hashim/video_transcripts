# Piers Morgan refuses to call war in Gaza a genocide
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M)
*  Do you condemn Benjamin Netanyahu's terrorism against the children of Gaza? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=0.0s)]
*  I wouldn't categorize it as you do as terrorism, although I do think that they've committed some [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=4.16s)]
*  acts which I do think are acts of terrorists. You're not going to get me to say that what Israel's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=9.76s)]
*  been doing is terrorism because I believe they are defending people. Why not, that's what I'm wondering. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  You said 40 babies killed, some of them being dead, that's fine, none of them were beheaded. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=18.72s)]
*  Right, okay. And you said it as fact. Okay, but why are you defending Hamas? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=21.76s)]
*  That's your response. So when I say to you, for example, is Trump a racist? Yes or no? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=25.44s)]
*  I don't think he is. So why does he say racist stuff? I don't think he's a racist. I've known him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=28.48s)]
*  Why does he say racist stuff? Why does he say racist stuff, Piers? I don't know. This is my [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=32.96s)]
*  favorite quote. To those who warned this was what was going to happen with Trump, you've been proven [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=37.68s)]
*  right. It's a sobering moment. Yeah, I was right and you were wrong, but I don't see any humility [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=41.84s)]
*  from you today when it comes to Trump. No, no. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=46.56s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=48.32s)]
*  Hello. Many of you have seen me appear on Piers Morgan's show, Piers Uncensored this year, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=56.32s)]
*  have watched me have some pretty lively debates on that show with him as a guest. Well, today [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=61.68s)]
*  I'm delighted to say that the tables have turned. Piers Morgan is joining me here as a guest on my [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=65.6s)]
*  show, Mayor the Unfiltered here in New York City. Piers, welcome to the show. Well, to be honest, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  you've dominated the interviews we do on my show. So much people think that was on your show. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=74.88s)]
*  Well, let's see. Let's see if you can return the favor today. There is much to discuss. I want to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  talk about the two big issues that you've covered on your show this year. That's made your show huge [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  around the world. And it's two issues I talk about often when I come on your show, but I want to hear [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=87.92s)]
*  your views. So this is a great opportunity for us and for our audience. There is a question you have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  repeatedly asked all your Palestinian and pro-Palestinian guests. And you've had a lot of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=96.88s)]
*  them, to be fair. People appraised you for that. But there's one question you ask almost all of them, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=101.04s)]
*  to the point where it's become a bit of a joke, a bit of a meme. So let me start by asking you [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  a version of that question. Do you condemn Benjamin Netanyahu's terrorism against the children of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=110.64s)]
*  Gaza? Well, I wouldn't categorize it as you do as terrorism, although I do think that they've [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  committed some acts which I do think are acts of terrorists. For example, the aggressive violent [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=122.48s)]
*  expansion on the settlements on the West Bank, I think you could inarguably say, well, that's a [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=129.04s)]
*  form of terrorism. My hesitation in using that categorization for what Israel has done in Gaza [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=133.6s)]
*  is that, as I've said to Palestinian guests, I'm not sure how else people expected or how else the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=140.16s)]
*  Israeli government should have responded to the terror attack of October the 7th, given the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=147.68s)]
*  monumental scale of what happened that day. It seemed to me Hamas knew exactly what Israel would [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=152.48s)]
*  do, didn't care about its civilians, was hiding amongst them, had a tunnel system and thought, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=157.04s)]
*  bring it on, let's have this out. So I've always felt that Israel not only had a right to defend [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=163.6s)]
*  itself, it had a moral duty to defend its people. By killing Palestinian kids? Well, listen, my brother [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=168.64s)]
*  served tools of Iraq and Afghanistan and the British army, as did my brother-in-law. There were [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=174.88s)]
*  military all through my family. They've all taken part in conflicts where civilians killing children [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=180.16s)]
*  have been killed. I think the particular problem in Gaza is that half the population are under 18, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=184.16s)]
*  of two million, and that clearly a disgusting amount of children have been killed in this conflict. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  So my answer to your question, I wouldn't categorize it as terrorism to respond to a terror [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=196.32s)]
*  attack by going to kill the terrorists. However, has it got completely unacceptable the level of [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=202.88s)]
*  civilian death that's been going on in Gaza, particularly children? I say yes, and this has to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=208.96s)]
*  stop. What is the acceptable level of death? Well, I don't know, that's why I've always said from the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=214.24s)]
*  start, what is proportionate? What do people expect people to do? I mean, for example, when America [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=217.44s)]
*  after 9-11 went into Iraq, I, as you know, I waged a campaign at the Daily Mirror newspaper against it. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=222.4s)]
*  I thought it was an illegal... But you haven't waged a campaign against this? Well, because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=229.12s)]
*  the point about Iraq was they didn't perpetrate 9-11. There's nothing to do with it. So it's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=232.8s)]
*  about the goal, not the conduct of the war. I'm asking you about the conduct. I don't want to have [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=238.0s)]
*  an argument about the goals. I understand. I'm saying if you kill, for example, you saw the video, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=241.2s)]
*  because I know you're on social media as much as I am, a video that Washington Post verified of a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=244.72s)]
*  little kid, 13 years old, is attacked by a drone, minding his own business. He's not Hamas, there's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=248.56s)]
*  no Hamas hiding behind him. He's attacked. As he's bleeding out and people come to help him, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=252.88s)]
*  they attack again. That's a double tap. It's what Al-Qaeda and ISIS do, double tap strike. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=257.52s)]
*  How is that not an act of terror? Well, because... Two kids are killed deliberately. I've seen a lot [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=262.0s)]
*  of videos. Some of them aren't... But that one specifically, is it an act of terror in your view? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=266.48s)]
*  It is in your eyes. No, I'm asking you. Well, no, I haven't seen the one you're talking about. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=270.40000000000003s)]
*  What I would say about it is that I want to see all of these things properly investigated [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=274.8s)]
*  and to establish whether it'd be war crimes committed. And if they have been, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  absolutely hold the people who perpetrated it into account. So you think Yahya Sinwar is a terrorist, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=282.88s)]
*  right? Yeah. And there was an arrest warrant request for Yahya Sinwar from the International [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=286.72s)]
*  Criminal Court, Chief Prosecutor Kareem Khan, British lawyer. He's also put out an arrest [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=291.52s)]
*  warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu. He's accused Netanyahu, well, he's asked for one. The court is [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=296.0s)]
*  being lobbied not to do it. He's put out an arrest... He's asked for an arrest warrant and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  the indictments he's put out include... This is what he's accused Netanyahu of. Starvation, murder, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  willful killing, extermination. How is Netanyahu not a terrorist, Piers? Well, it may end up being [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  that he is convicted of war crimes that suggest he's a terrorist. But Sinwar hasn't been... Wasn't [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=314.32s)]
*  convicted of war crimes. Sinwar... Sinwar... I'm just being consistent. The ICC Chief Prosecutor put out [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=318.24s)]
*  warrant requests for both. Let me be consistent back to you. Here's the difference. Hamas made [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=322.32s)]
*  no secret of what they did on October the 7th. Sinwar directed and ordered that attack. No one [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=326.24s)]
*  speaks of it. Nor has Israel. Yeah, but what the difference is that Hamas said, here are the GoPro [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=330.48s)]
*  cameras. We are going to show the world what we're doing here. So is Israel. I just mentioned a video [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=335.6s)]
*  where a kid is killed on camera. In fact, Israeli soldiers have put out TikToks of their war crimes, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=340.16s)]
*  Piers. You're not going to get me to say that what Israel's been doing is terrorism because [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=344.16s)]
*  I believe they are defending... Why not, though, is what I'm wondering. It seems to be just a stubborn [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=347.68s)]
*  resistance to the fact. Because any country in the world that had October the 7th perpetrated [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=351.12s)]
*  against them would do what Israel has done. No, they wouldn't. Yes, they would. They would have killed [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  kids on this level. No, if you had literally a country on your border... Well, it's not a country [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=358.16s)]
*  on your border, it's occupied territory. I think you've conceded yourself in previous... I have [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=362.72s)]
*  actually said to you, I believe it is occupied territory. Okay, so it's not a country on your [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=365.92s)]
*  border. Let's call it... What do you want to call it? Occupied territory. Well, let's call it [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=369.04s)]
*  Gaza. Okay. On one single day, in 13 different entry points, 3,000 people came through and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=372.4s)]
*  committed as much mayhem and murder as they could possibly commit in a deliberate attempt to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=380.79999999999995s)]
*  destabilize and take down Israel, which is the intention of their original charter. If that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=386.64s)]
*  happened on any border, shared border in the world, there is no country in the world that would not [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  have responded with military force in the way that Israel has done. Hey, I don't agree with that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=400.0s)]
*  Let me say you're right. Every country would have done that. It doesn't make it not terrorist. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=404.48s)]
*  Then what you're saying is any country that then goes after terrorists to perpetrate that kind of [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=407.84s)]
*  attack automatically themselves become terrorists. No. I dispute that kind of... [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=412.88s)]
*  No, I'm saying that's a straw man. I'm saying you can defend... Or give an example where they're not terrorists. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=418.48s)]
*  I just gave you an example. They could have responded to Hamas without attacking a kid, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=421.52s)]
*  killing the kid, and when people come to rescue, attacking them as well. I can be here all day. We [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=425.44s)]
*  don't have the time. I could go through. They didn't need to attack an apartment building. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=429.6s)]
*  When American forces... We're not doing one about them. We're not doing one about them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  They went after ISIS, but they killed a lot of innocent children. Yes. I think those were acts of war crimes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=435.92s)]
*  I think war crimes are acts of terrorism. So if you go after any terror group in the world... [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=440.16s)]
*  No, I'm saying if you... Hold on, Piers. The definition of terrorism according to every dictionary [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=444.72s)]
*  is the use of political violence against civilians for political goals. That is what Netanyahu is [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  doing. He said it openly. Israelis have said it on your show. Well, he's responding to a terrorist [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=453.52000000000004s)]
*  attack. By doing more terrorism. He's killed 33 times as many people as Netanyahu. Let me be clear. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=457.52s)]
*  That Sinwar's a terrorist and not Netanyahu. Netanyahu should absolutely no longer be Prime [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  Minister of Israel. Should he be at the ICC? Probably, yeah. So if the warrant comes down, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=466.88s)]
*  you support the UK arresting him if he comes to the UK? I absolutely think that his alleged war [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=471.28s)]
*  crimes, and I use that because they've not been substantiated, his alleged war crimes should [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=476.24s)]
*  absolutely be investigated. This doesn't make any sense. But you and I are going to agree with you. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no. I agree with you that they haven't been substantiated, but I'm being consistent. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=483.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm saying everyone, Hamas, Israel, should be substantiated in investigation. You're saying [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=487.2s)]
*  one side's terrorists based on GoPro, but the other side's not terrorists even though we've [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=491.36s)]
*  watched them kill thousands of people on camera. Literally, I've seen it. I saw them gun down an [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=495.28s)]
*  old lady holding a white flag. Hamas have made no secret that what they did was terrorism. Nor of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=499.2s)]
*  Israel. Have you listened to Israeli soldiers? You should watch our documentary. It's called [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=504.08s)]
*  Israel's Real Extremism. I will watch it. It shows Israeli soldiers talking proudly about what they've [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=506.88s)]
*  done in Gaza. It's not just the T word, Piers, that you've been reluctant to use in relation to [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=510.71999999999997s)]
*  Israel, but also the G word. Genocide. It's not genocide. Why are you, so let's talk about that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=514.32s)]
*  Why are you perfectly happy to call what Russia is doing in Ukraine a genocide, but not what [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=518.72s)]
*  Israel's doing in Gaza when there are fewer civilians, far fewer kids killed in Ukraine [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=523.7600000000001s)]
*  than in Gaza, arguably way less genocide or rhetoric from the Russian government than we [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  hear from the Israeli government? Why are you so uncensored on Russia but not on Israel? What are [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=531.7600000000001s)]
*  you afraid of? I actually thought when you first jumped me with that, it was a good point. I hadn't [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  realised I'd use the word genocide in relation to what was going on in Russia. I did go away [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=540.4s)]
*  and think about that quite carefully. You've got to be careful about the word genocide. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=544.8s)]
*  The word genocide is where you deliberately exterminate a group of people based on ethnicity. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=549.76s)]
*  The reality about, let's take Gaza first of all, if Israel actually wanted to get rid of everyone [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=557.04s)]
*  in Gaza, they have the military power to do that. They have nuclear weapons. They could just nuke [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=562.4s)]
*  Gaza. Some of them, I suspect, would quite like to do. They've got some massively right-wing [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=566.56s)]
*  headbangers in that government, Ben Gavir, Smodrich and others, who I suspect wouldn't [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=571.68s)]
*  hesitate to wage a form of genocide. I accept that completely. The reality is that there are [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=575.5999999999999s)]
*  two million people in Gaza of which, depending on which estimate you want to believe, but the [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=580.88s)]
*  official records from the Hamas-run health authority, there are about 45,000 people who have [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=585.5999999999999s)]
*  died of which it is estimated that around 15,000 to 20,000 are Hamas. Estimated by Israel. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=591.36s)]
*  Okay, but there are different figures put out. It's in that ballpark, okay? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=598.64s)]
*  No. You can say that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=602.64s)]
*  Here's my point. It's not two million people. That's not the definition of genocide. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=605.04s)]
*  Well, isn't it? No. The genocide convention doesn't say you have to kill everyone. By the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=609.76s)]
*  way, you said this to Bassem Youssef, our good friend last week on the show. I want to read you [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=613.52s)]
*  exactly what you said. Israel hasn't nuked Gaza, quote, they could have done. They haven't done [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=617.76s)]
*  that. If you're really genocidal, why wouldn't you do that? But Russia has the ability to nuke [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine too. Russia has the biggest stockpile of nuclear warheads in the world. So why hasn't [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=626.88s)]
*  Russia been doing a genocide? No, I don't think they are. And I shouldn't have said that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  Wow. So in order to defend Israel, you're withdrawing your allegation against Russia. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=634.56s)]
*  Because you made me think about it. I didn't remember that I'd use that word in relation to [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=638.4s)]
*  what it- But it's not just Russia. You've said it about many people. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=642.64s)]
*  Well, OK. So you said Bashar al-Assad in 2012, one year into the civil war in Syria, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=645.68s)]
*  when the death toll was much lower than Gaza. You said it was a genocide. You said the Rohingya in [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=650.16s)]
*  Berlin- Well, that's interesting. I mean, you said Rohingya in the answer. I'm finished my question, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=654.64s)]
*  then you answer. You said the Rohingya in 2017, far less death toll in Burma, is a genocide. So I look [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=658.8s)]
*  at Piers Morgan, I say, here's this uncensored person, very bold, outspoken, opinionated man. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=665.3599999999999s)]
*  He says Syria is a genocide. Burma is a genocide. Ukraine is a genocide. Israel? No, it's not a [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=670.08s)]
*  genocide. And now today, actually, I'm going to withdraw the charge of genocide in Ukraine. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=676.64s)]
*  That's how much I don't want to accuse Israel of genocide. No, it's not that. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=680.48s)]
*  That feels like you're afraid. No, the other examples I would give, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=683.2s)]
*  I would say absolutely there was genocidal intent. You did make me think about what was [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=686.0s)]
*  happening in Russia and Ukraine. And the reality is, as people know in that area, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=690.88s)]
*  it is complicated because all the people in the Donbass, for example, speak Russian. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=696.0s)]
*  And some of them, a percentage of them, identify as Russian. And we'd quite like to go back to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=699.76s)]
*  being Russian. So I think to use the word genocide about what Russia is doing there [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=703.76s)]
*  is the wrong term. And I shouldn't have used it. So you're withdrawing it on Syria and Burma as [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=708.0s)]
*  well? No, because I think they are definitely a genocidal intent. They're genocidal intent. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=712.16s)]
*  What you want people to believe is that what Israel is doing, without any reference to October [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=716.72s)]
*  the 7th, they want to basically kill Palestinians. But Shahrar would say exactly what Netanyahu says. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=721.52s)]
*  He says, I'm fighting terrorists. They're hiding amongst civilians in Homs. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=725.76s)]
*  Let me ask you. Let me throw it back at you. No, no, no. To quote you, this is my show. I've got [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=728.48s)]
*  limited time. I'm asking you questions. Bashar al-Assad would say exactly what Netanyahu says. He [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=733.2s)]
*  says, I'm fighting terrorists. I don't believe him and you don't believe him. We don't like Bashar [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=737.84s)]
*  al-Assad. We agree on Assad. But he would say exactly what Netanyahu says. I'm fighting terrorists [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=740.4s)]
*  who are hiding amongst civilians in Homs and I'm bombing them. I'm fighting a war of self-defense. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=744.64s)]
*  You say genocidal. I say, yeah, maybe genocidal. Israel says amelek. They say total annihilation. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=748.88s)]
*  They say we're going to destroy Gaza. We're going to level it, etc. You say not genocidal. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=754.88s)]
*  I don't get it. I don't think it is genocidal. No. Even though the facts say otherwise. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=759.36s)]
*  Historians like Omar Barton and Amos Goldberg, Arya Nair, some of the experts on Holocaust say [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=764.32s)]
*  it is a genocide. But a lot of experts say it's not a genocide. That's actually some of the leading [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=769.84s)]
*  Holocaust experts lining up in one direction. You've got your experts. I've seen many other [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=773.36s)]
*  experts who say it's not genocide. So you can, you know, look. I just find it fascinating that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=777.84s)]
*  you'll call every other conflict, which has fewer deaths than Gaza, genocide. But for some reason, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=782.32s)]
*  we've got fewer deaths in Syria. There were in February 2012. I checked. You said it was a [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=787.12s)]
*  genocide in February 2012. See, I do my homework. I checked. Seven and a half thousand people in [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=791.2800000000001s)]
*  Syria being killed at that point. You said genocide. Forty five thousand people in Gaza. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=795.44s)]
*  You say not genocide. Well, it comes down to what you think the intent is of the people perpetrating. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=798.88s)]
*  You don't think they're trying to erase northern Gaza right now? I think what they're doing is- [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=802.6400000000001s)]
*  Are you seeing what's happening in northern Gaza? Here's what I think they're doing. I think Israel [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=805.84s)]
*  genuinely believe what they're trying to do is eliminate Hamas, who they perceive to be a terrorist. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=808.96s)]
*  I think you're speaking on behalf of Israelis who aren't saying it. They're making it very clear. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=813.12s)]
*  It's not just about Hamas. They're seizing territory in Gaza. They're planning to, some of them are [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=816.5600000000001s)]
*  planning to resettle in Gaza. And right now, northern Gaza, according to the UN humanitarian [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=820.88s)]
*  chief, everyone is at risk of dying, Piers. Everyone. That's the words of the UN humanitarian chief. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=824.64s)]
*  Don't misunderstand me. I think what's happening in Gaza is horrific. You just won't say genocide? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=828.96s)]
*  No. You asked me if it's genocide. I don't think it is. And you asked me if it's terrorism. I don't [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=833.12s)]
*  think it is. Do I think it's got unacceptable, the level of civilian death? Absolutely. But you do- [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=837.2s)]
*  Hang on, hang on, hang on. Do you think Netanyahu probably could end up in the ICC? Do I think that [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=841.9200000000001s)]
*  they have no plan for the end of this? Absolutely. Do I think Netanyahu and the headbangers in his [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=844.4000000000001s)]
*  cabinet should go? Absolutely. Do I think Hamas should have any authority going forward? No. So [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=849.2800000000001s)]
*  there are lots of ways that we can try and- I know, but ultimately history will judge where [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=854.48s)]
*  you were on this and they'll say you were right on Iraq and you didn't really come on board on- [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=858.08s)]
*  And I don't think they'll find that you were right about calling it terrorism or genocide. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=861.36s)]
*  Okay. We'll see. I hope you're right. Obviously, I don't want it to be a genocide, but it looks [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=865.84s)]
*  like one, sounds like one, walks like one. Just on last, I do want to talk about Donald Trump with [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=869.36s)]
*  you, but just on this topic, October 7th was bad enough. I think we can both agree. The kidnapping [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=873.2s)]
*  and killing of civilians, war crimes, without anyone having to exaggerate how bad it was. And [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  yet given the way a genocidal Israeli government, in my view, not yours, has used atrocity propaganda [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  to try and justify the mass killing of Palestinians, especially Palestinian children, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=888.88s)]
*  and that October the 7th, some would argue, even got as a Palestinian American child killed in [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=892.88s)]
*  Illinois. There's that argument that that guy was infuriated by talk of beheaded babies, etc. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=896.4s)]
*  Do you regret, Piers, a year later, having used your very big platforms, YouTube, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=901.28s)]
*  Twitter, to spread that atrocity propaganda, to repeat the Israeli line uncritically, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=905.52s)]
*  saying, and I quote, 40 babies being killed, some of them being beheaded? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=910.32s)]
*  Well, I never said as people to try to claim that 40 babies got beheaded, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=914.4s)]
*  we do know that some babies were killed. We do know a baby was kidnapped. What I find fascinating [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=918.72s)]
*  about this, when people started going on their Hamas defense journey. That's not a Hamas defense, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=924.48s)]
*  we're journalists, we believe in facts. I know you did, but I also had Bassem Youssef on last week [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=929.6s)]
*  saying there was no sexual abuse of- Bassem Youssef can speak for himself. I'm asking you about 40 [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  babies being killed, some of them being beheaded. Do you regret saying that as a journalist? You [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=937.5200000000001s)]
*  correct things when you're wrong. As you know, I've already said this on my show. So had you done [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=940.8000000000001s)]
*  your research in the capable way you say you do, you would know that I've already said, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=944.96s)]
*  yeah, it turned out that 40 babies were not killed. That's weird because I've just checked [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=948.32s)]
*  this morning and all your tweets are still up saying that 40 babies were killed. So if you've [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=952.48s)]
*  corrected it- I've said it on my show. But your tweet, how many million followers do you have? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=955.84s)]
*  I know you love talking about your followers. How many do you have? Yeah, how many? I think it's [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=959.76s)]
*  8.8 million. So 8.8 million, we can still see multiple examples. But they can watch my show. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=963.44s)]
*  Which show? My Piers Morgan Uncensored. But multiple shows. So you say you got it wrong [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=969.52s)]
*  and you apologize for getting it wrong. Have you apologized? Let me be clear. I'm just trying to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=973.84s)]
*  get to the facts here. Let me answer. There was a report that said 40 babies are being beheaded. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=977.6s)]
*  People believed it in the moment. It turned out not to be true. I never actually said [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=983.76s)]
*  40 babies are being beheaded, contrary to the avalanche of people who on a daily- [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=988.64s)]
*  You passed it off as fact, Piers. No, I didn't. October 10th, talking to Joan Collins, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=993.2800000000001s)]
*  this new revelation of 40 babies being killed, some of them being beheaded. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=998.72s)]
*  How can any human being do that to a baby? There's nothing in there that expresses any doubt. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1002.96s)]
*  I didn't say 40 babies got beheaded. You said 40 babies killed, some of them being beheaded. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1006.64s)]
*  None of them were beheaded. And you said it as fact. But why are you defending Hamas? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1010.64s)]
*  That's your response. I'm not defending Hamas. I just started with Hamas did war crimes on October [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1016.08s)]
*  the 7th. Horrific. And they should all go to prison. Were any babies killed? Yes. Children were killed. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1020.08s)]
*  Were any kidnapped? But I'm wondering why you pushed an Israeli propaganda line. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1024.64s)]
*  Were any kidnapped? Yes. Horrific. And I've condemned it, Piers. Were any people beheaded? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1027.76s)]
*  I've condemned it. I believe a Thai worker and maybe a soldier were according to our video. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1031.52s)]
*  Okay. So babies were killed, babies were kidnapped, people were beheaded. Right? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1036.72s)]
*  And your position is you want to sit here and split hairs about how many- [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1041.28s)]
*  Well, people died as a result of this, Piers. A kid was killed in Illinois by a guy who believed [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1045.6s)]
*  this stuff. Oh, a lot of people died. 1,200 people got killed in one day. But you and I are not [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  responsible for that, right? You and I are not responsible. And nearly 7,000 got wounded. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1051.52s)]
*  You and I are not responsible for that. But you want to sit here and try and defend Hamas. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1055.04s)]
*  Where did I defend Hamas? You are. When? You're trying to downplay- [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1058.5600000000002s)]
*  I literally started by saying, don't we both agree the kidnapping and killing of civilians [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1061.2s)]
*  are war crimes? Right. So how do I defend Hamas? That's a lie. You're just lying. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1066.3200000000002s)]
*  Are you suggesting that I- I'm suggesting that as a journalist, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1069.76s)]
*  you push something that was false, you should have corrected it and apologised. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1072.5600000000002s)]
*  Right. What did I do to push it was false? Let me read a line. The new revelation of 40 [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1075.52s)]
*  babies being killed, some of them being beheaded. 40 babies were not killed, no babies were beheaded. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1079.68s)]
*  I never said 40 babies were beheaded. But you said murdered. 40 babies were murdered. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1083.04s)]
*  It now turns out that not many babies were murdered. No. In the fog of war, it turned out- [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1087.2s)]
*  And I just asked my question, was you saying that? That was my question. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1092.24s)]
*  Instead you said you were defending Hamas. Come on, cliche. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1095.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. So Hamas didn't kill quite as many babies- [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1097.76s)]
*  The Israeli government exaggerated what happened to justify their actual beheading of children in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  Gaza. Actually, I think that when 7, 8,000, 8,200 people were either killed or wounded, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1104.8799999999999s)]
*  it was very difficult for them to establish the truth for quite a few weeks. We now have a much [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1110.8s)]
*  clearer idea of what happened. Do you believe the US and UK media are biased in favour of Israel? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1115.52s)]
*  Parts of them, yeah. Why? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1120.96s)]
*  Why do I believe it? No, why are they biased in favour of Israel? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1123.28s)]
*  I don't know. I have to ask them. I'm not- [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1125.76s)]
*  You've worked at it for decades. I've worked everywhere. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1127.52s)]
*  I've asked them. News of the world. I'm asking you. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1129.6s)]
*  You are one of the most famous people in the British media. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1131.04s)]
*  What do you want me to say? Why is the British media biased in favour of Israel? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1133.6s)]
*  What do you think I am? I didn't ask that question. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1136.56s)]
*  What, do you think I am? I think you are, yes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1138.4s)]
*  Why would I have so many Palestinian guests on? You tell me. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1140.4s)]
*  If I genuinely am biased and don't want to have their say being given- [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1142.88s)]
*  You have this very black and white view of the world, Piers. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1146.48s)]
*  Why would I have you on? You could be biased towards Israel. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1148.24s)]
*  You're one of the most partisan guests I've ever had on my show. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1150.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any- Piers, am I pro-Palestinian? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1151.92s)]
*  Huh? Am I pro-Palestinian? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1154.0s)]
*  Of course. Why do I have you on then? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1155.0400000000002s)]
*  Huh? This is a ridiculous argument. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1156.3200000000002s)]
*  Just because you have guests on from the other side doesn't mean- [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1158.24s)]
*  Actually, it does. No, it doesn't, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1160.48s)]
*  because then I'm not pro-Palestinian according to your logic. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1161.7600000000002s)]
*  No, no, of course you're pro-Palestinian. All right, all right. Am I pro-Trump? Am I pro-Trump? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1163.92s)]
*  I've got you on today. If you're trying to categorise me as- [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1168.64s)]
*  It's a very strange argument. If you're trying to categorise me as [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1170.3200000000002s)]
*  pro-Israeli over Palestinian, I dispute that categorisation. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1172.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm sure you will dispute it, but I didn't actually ask about you, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1175.1200000000001s)]
*  but we went down that road. The British and American media bias- [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1177.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, I can't ask them. In favour of Israel. I'm just wondering what [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1180.0s)]
*  you think it is. You can't ask other media. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1181.68s)]
*  Do you think it's fear? Possibly. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1182.88s)]
*  Do you think it's racism? What do you think it is? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1184.16s)]
*  I don't know. Ask them. I'm asking you. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1186.0s)]
*  How do I know? You're not them. You are them. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1188.16s)]
*  I don't know what their motivation is. All right, let's talk about the other- [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1189.76s)]
*  You're so uncensored until you get to Israel. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1194.0s)]
*  I don't know the answer. What do you want me to say? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1196.72s)]
*  Let's talk about the other big story right now that you have strong [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1198.8s)]
*  views on. The US election next week. You think Trump will win, I know. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1201.12s)]
*  I do. You're a big supporter of his, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1205.12s)]
*  a friend of Donald Trump's. Here's what I don't understand. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1206.32s)]
*  Hang on. You say this a lot. Don't categorise me thinking he's going to [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1209.28s)]
*  win with my supposing- No, no, no. I'm categorising your support [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1212.8799999999999s)]
*  based on what you say. I've never told anyone to vote for Trump. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1215.36s)]
*  But you always defend him. We just came from a recording of your show. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1217.6s)]
*  We spent one hour defending him. I don't know. You were unrelentingly [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  attacking him as usual, using phrases like his rally here was akin to the Nazis. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1224.88s)]
*  And I think that's ridiculous. I didn't hear you say anything- [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1230.88s)]
*  That doesn't mean I support him. It means I think that when people like you say, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1233.92s)]
*  who's the new- If I had my phone, which I don't, I would just open it and show you [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1237.5200000000002s)]
*  all your New York Post columns, which are all anti-Harrison pro-Trump. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1241.0400000000002s)]
*  But anyways- I think she's useless. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1243.5200000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you this. How could it be okay for Trump to be allowed to be president again [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1244.88s)]
*  when Trump is clearly mad, he's nuts, he's deranged, he's mentally unstable, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1250.6399999999999s)]
*  he's attacked American democracy? You don't disagree with any of that, do you? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1255.6s)]
*  I've said many of those things about him in the past. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1259.2s)]
*  Yeah. So then how can you say that he should be president again? [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1261.76s)]
*  Because I think in politics, people like Trump have had periods in their career [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1264.56s)]
*  where they've been doing ridiculous things, which I've heavily criticised before. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1272.08s)]
*  But they've also done other things which in the totality of how you judge them [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1275.9199999999998s)]
*  have made them electable. Trump is going to win in my estimation, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1279.6000000000001s)]
*  because for all your shrieking about how despicable he is, what a narcissist- [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1283.1200000000001s)]
*  You said he was despicable. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1287.1200000000001s)]
*  I've said many bad things about him. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1288.24s)]
*  Exactly. So why are you picking on me? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1289.28s)]
*  But I've also said, unlike you, I've said positive things about him as well. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1290.0800000000002s)]
*  But that just makes you look silly, not me. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1293.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1294.72s)]
*  Because it makes me look balanced. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1294.88s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1296.72s)]
*  It makes me look balanced. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1297.6000000000001s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1298.64s)]
*  It does. It makes you unbalanced. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1299.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, let's, for our viewers who might not be- they might just see your pro-Trump stuff. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1301.04s)]
*  Let's just say some of the stuff you've said. I went back and read your daily mail column [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1303.68s)]
*  the day after January 6th. You went way beyond anything I've said about Trump. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1306.64s)]
*  Well, you said he's morphed into a monster. There's no way back for him. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1310.3200000000002s)]
*  Deranged figurehead. Lost his mind. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1313.44s)]
*  I'm done with Donald Trump. That part clearly wasn't true. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1315.8400000000001s)]
*  Such a person should not be president of the United States for a second long. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1318.5600000000002s)]
*  And that person must be. Why are you suddenly now back? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1320.96s)]
*  I was also done- [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1322.8000000000002s)]
*  He's actually worse today than he was on 7th of January. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't agree with that. But I was also done with the manager of Arsenal. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1325.2800000000002s)]
*  And then I turned around and after time he won me around again. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1328.64s)]
*  So it's all a game? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1331.68s)]
*  It's not a game, but I think- [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1332.8000000000002s)]
*  You said very strongly he's deranged. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1334.24s)]
*  And by the way- [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1336.72s)]
*  A monster. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1337.2s)]
*  And by the way- [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1338.0s)]
*  We should use the 25th amendment. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1338.48s)]
*  Had you watched my interview with Donald Trump- [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1340.0s)]
*  I have. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1342.0s)]
*  When I launched Piers Morgan on Sensen, you will know that somebody sent him all of this, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1342.24s)]
*  Nigel Farage, before the interview and he read it all for himself. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1345.76s)]
*  And we had a good old ding-dong about it, right? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1348.8s)]
*  That doesn't make it any less weird that you're sitting here saying- [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1351.6s)]
*  I think what happened on January 6th was terrible. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1354.0s)]
*  So why does he get to be president? Why does that not disqualify him from the job? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1356.08s)]
*  You said it on January 7th. You said it disqualified him. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1359.68s)]
*  I agree. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1361.68s)]
*  So what changed? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1362.16s)]
*  I changed my mind. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1362.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1363.6s)]
*  Is it because he's closer to power now? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1364.16s)]
*  No, it's because I think- [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1365.92s)]
*  Some people would say Piers Morgan's changed his mind just because Trump's about to win. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1366.88s)]
*  No, I changed my mind about lots of things and lots of people. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1369.92s)]
*  Genocide, Trump- [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1372.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm quite- as you may have gathered, I'm quite an emotive person. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  I've actually tried- [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1376.96s)]
*  I feel like it's more that there are certain issues you won't touch. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1377.76s)]
*  Israel, Trump. You're very keff. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1381.6000000000001s)]
*  But I've been very critical of Trump. Has he just read? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1383.3600000000001s)]
*  Not now though. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1385.3600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1386.64s)]
*  I just don't understand how you can say- [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1387.52s)]
*  It depends what he does and says. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1388.72s)]
*  Well, nothing's changed since January 7th. He's the same guy who did an insurrection. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1389.92s)]
*  He'll probably do an insurrection again. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1393.2s)]
*  You hate him and everything he's done. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1395.04s)]
*  You hate him. You hate him. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1396.24s)]
*  You said Trump's gone mad. I'm done with Donald Trump. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1397.44s)]
*  This is what you said on January 11th. This is my favourite quote of yours. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1401.04s)]
*  I don't know what you think the God truth is because I've- [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1402.72s)]
*  I've talked about this a lot. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1404.4s)]
*  The God truth is that you're not consistent. But listen to me. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1405.28s)]
*  Why? I changed my mind. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1407.04s)]
*  This is my favourite quote. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1408.0800000000002s)]
*  To those who warned this was what was going to happen with Trump, you've been proven right. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1409.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a sobering moment. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1413.28s)]
*  Yeah, I was right and you were wrong. But I don't see any humility from you today when it comes to Trump. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1414.24s)]
*  No. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1418.96s)]
*  Even though you were wrong in 2020. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1419.28s)]
*  Because even when Trump does good things, you never acknowledge it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1420.56s)]
*  What did he do good since 2021? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1423.44s)]
*  What about killing the leader of ISIS? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1425.2s)]
*  He didn't do ISIS since 2021. We're talking about- you said you were done with him on 2021. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1426.56s)]
*  What's he done good to win you back? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1430.32s)]
*  Well, it's not about winning me back. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1432.0s)]
*  Yes, he did. You said I'm done with Donald Trump. I'm wondering why you're not- [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1433.28s)]
*  It's not about winning me back. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1436.24s)]
*  It is, Spears. This interview's about you. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1437.76s)]
*  My view of Trump has evolved a lot. It's going up and goes down. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1439.36s)]
*  Why? That's why I'm asking why. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1441.76s)]
*  Because I know him personally. I like him personally. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1442.8s)]
*  Some of the things he does, I think, are very effective. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1446.1599999999999s)]
*  Some of the things he does, I think, are completely wrong. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1448.1599999999999s)]
*  Give this guy a win, benefit of the doubt. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1451.3600000000001s)]
*  I've always been quite an emotive columnist. I will call things in the moment. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1453.2s)]
*  And then after time, things change. Everyone thought Trump was done. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1457.0400000000002s)]
*  It turned out he made a miraculous comeback. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1460.8000000000002s)]
*  I actually quite like comeback stories. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1463.3600000000001s)]
*  Your categorisation, he's worse than other than he was. I don't agree with that. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1465.2s)]
*  I think most people would look at him and say he's more mentally unstable. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1468.0s)]
*  Most people don't know. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1470.5600000000002s)]
*  Hold on. You called him mentally unstable. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1471.0400000000002s)]
*  Most people agree with you. He wouldn't make the original election. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1472.24s)]
*  Let's do facts, Spears. You called him mentally unstable in January 2021. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1474.88s)]
*  Point to me. What he's done since then makes him more mentally stable. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1478.88s)]
*  I think anyone who looks at him would say he's definitely less stable than he was in 2021. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1482.24s)]
*  I think that in that period after losing, he did go a bit nuts. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1485.6000000000001s)]
*  And he's not nuts anymore? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1488.88s)]
*  I don't think he is. I watched him last night at the rally. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1490.0s)]
*  I didn't think he was nuts. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1492.4s)]
*  We're sitting here in New York. If you went on the subway outside, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1493.1200000000001s)]
*  if you went on the London Underground back home and some old guy came and sat next to you, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1495.7600000000002s)]
*  ranting and raving about being the chosen one, the King of Israel, a stable genius, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1499.2s)]
*  ranting and raving about shark attacks and Hannibal Lecter and Arnold Palmer's penis [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1502.88s)]
*  for 15 long minutes, the water pressure in his toilet and showers, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1506.88s)]
*  you would get up and you would move to another seat. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1509.6000000000001s)]
*  You would not say that man should have nuclear codes. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1511.68s)]
*  If you sat next to me on the subway ranting away like you normally do, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1515.44s)]
*  I think you were nuts too. But I still talked to you. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1518.3200000000002s)]
*  But you wouldn't give me the nuclear codes? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1520.0s)]
*  No, I wouldn't. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1522.0s)]
*  No, but you'd give it to Trump even though he talks about it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1522.5600000000002s)]
*  You spent half an hour in July badgering me over the Democrats supposedly calling [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1525.44s)]
*  Trump Hitler, even though it was JD Vance who said that. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1529.2800000000002s)]
*  How do you feel about the recent revelations from General John Kelly, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1531.1200000000001s)]
*  Trump's chief of staff, Marine General, a Republican, not a Democrat? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  Who said Trump praised Hitler, said he'd like to have had Hitler's generals. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1536.8s)]
*  His former top general, Mark Milley, said he's a fascist to the core. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1540.8s)]
*  Doesn't that bother you? You are the grandson of a British World War II hero. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1543.6s)]
*  You have Trump praising Hitler, quoting from Mein Kampf. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1547.04s)]
*  That doesn't bother you. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1549.84s)]
*  Look, he's not the new Hitler. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1551.12s)]
*  That's not what I asked. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1552.6399999999999s)]
*  Hang on, he's not running a branch of Nazis. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1553.52s)]
*  That's not straw man. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1555.84s)]
*  General's entitled to their view, but they're not always right. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1556.56s)]
*  I mean- [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1559.04s)]
*  So they're lying, are they? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1559.36s)]
*  I don't think Trump's a fascist. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1560.24s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1561.6s)]
*  Are they lying? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1561.84s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1562.3999999999999s)]
*  Are they lying? When he says he thinks Hitler, are they lying? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1562.96s)]
*  I think they're wrong. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1564.96s)]
*  No, no, no, look at the invasion. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1566.16s)]
*  You make a great point. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1567.52s)]
*  I wasn't in the room. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1568.16s)]
*  I wasn't in the room. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1569.04s)]
*  So General John Kelly's lying. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1570.48s)]
*  Hang on. Other people who were in the room dispute that that's what Trump said. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1571.68s)]
*  So multiple people over the years have talked about Trump's quotes. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1575.76s)]
*  They're all lying. All the officials. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1579.04s)]
*  I- [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1580.4s)]
*  We've all turned on him. Hold on, I just want to go through the list. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1580.64s)]
*  Mark Milley, Mark Esper, John Kelly, Jim Mattis. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1582.56s)]
*  They're all lying. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1586.48s)]
*  I don't know, nor do you. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1587.28s)]
*  I think Occam's razor says if everyone who worked with him, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1589.28s)]
*  almost everyone who said we can't endorse him again, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1592.0s)]
*  then we should take their word. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1594.32s)]
*  The bottom line is- [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1595.68s)]
*  The people who know him better, the bottom line is- [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  The bottom line is, do I think he's a- [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, they probably don't know him better than me, actually. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1599.28s)]
*  But they worked with him, they do. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1600.88s)]
*  Do I think Donald Trump is a fascist? No, I don't. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1602.0s)]
*  Do I think he's a neo-Nazi, running a bunch of neo-Nazis? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1604.64s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1607.6000000000001s)]
*  So when he says- [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1608.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think- [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1609.28s)]
*  It's not just me. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1609.68s)]
*  I think that view is nuts. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1610.72s)]
*  Really? So Robert Paxton, America's preeminent- [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1612.3200000000002s)]
*  I think you're nuts for thinking he's a new Nazi. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1614.0800000000002s)]
*  Robert Paxton is America's preeminent scholar of fascism, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1615.76s)]
*  historian at Columbia University Emeritus. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1618.8s)]
*  He said, I don't think Trump's a fascist for four years. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1620.48s)]
*  People exaggerating stuff. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1622.48s)]
*  Now he says, yeah, actually, he is a fascist. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1623.76s)]
*  And you know why? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1625.68s)]
*  Because you love to talk in the air, Piers. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1626.64s)]
*  Facts. This is what he's saying and doing. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1628.88s)]
*  He says, I'll terminate the constitution. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1630.72s)]
*  I'll be a dictator. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1632.72s)]
*  Why didn't he in the first four years? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1633.44s)]
*  Because you had Jim Mattis and John Kelly who won't be there. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1635.44s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1637.2800000000002s)]
*  He said, I'll terminate the constitution. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1637.68s)]
*  And he didn't have Supreme Court immunity, which he has now. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1638.88s)]
*  He says, you won't have to vote for me if you vote in four years. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1640.96s)]
*  I'll put the National Guard, he said to Maria Bartiromo the other day, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1643.92s)]
*  against the enemy within, against Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1646.0800000000002s)]
*  You're not supportive of that, right? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1648.88s)]
*  You don't support the National Guard being- [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1649.92s)]
*  Not as that's who he was talking about. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1651.2s)]
*  He said the enemy within. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1652.48s)]
*  But if he was talking about using the military to break up rioting, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1653.28s)]
*  I think most Americans would say, well, yeah, he's got a point. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1656.8s)]
*  It's funny because he's the one who did the rioting last time [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1658.8s)]
*  when you said you were done with him. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1660.8s)]
*  But what is your, out of interest, the Black Lives Matter rioting? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1661.6000000000001s)]
*  What was your view of that? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1664.56s)]
*  The vast majority of black minorities were peaceful. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  What about the rioting? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1667.52s)]
*  The rioting, they were arrested. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1668.96s)]
*  In fact, they were prosecuted in many ways, much worse than the January Vicks folks. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1670.0s)]
*  Out of interest, what is the difference about using, say, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1672.88s)]
*  police or military for breaking up rioting? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1675.92s)]
*  Huge difference. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1678.88s)]
*  You don't think- [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1679.44s)]
*  We've used- [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1680.0s)]
*  You don't think an American president using the military against- [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1680.32s)]
*  We have used military in the UK. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1682.3999999999999s)]
*  He wanted to use military against peaceful protesters. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1683.6s)]
*  We've used military to break up rioting. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1685.52s)]
*  Do you support shooting protesters in the legs? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1686.6399999999999s)]
*  That's what Mark Esper- [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1689.04s)]
*  That's what Donald Trump asked Mark Esper. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1690.0s)]
*  My question for you is- [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1691.52s)]
*  Hold on, Piers. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1692.32s)]
*  Now you don't get to ask me questions about- [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1693.2s)]
*  I just came from your show. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1694.56s)]
*  What is the big problem between- [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1695.52s)]
*  You're going to answer my question. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1696.56s)]
*  What is the problem between using armed police and military to break up rioting? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1697.6s)]
*  Out of interest, I'm curious. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1701.2s)]
*  I'm going to answer your question with the question I asked and I'll say it again. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1702.32s)]
*  When Donald Trump says to Mark Esper, shoot them in the legs, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1705.36s)]
*  do you support that behaviour? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1707.36s)]
*  Could you say he's not a fascist? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1708.8s)]
*  When he's saying shoot them in the legs- [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1710.08s)]
*  I don't think anyone should be shot in the legs unless they're terrorists. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1711.4399999999998s)]
*  Trump said that to Mark Esper. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1714.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1715.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, Esper's lying, right? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1716.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1717.12s)]
*  What a great journalist you are. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1718.72s)]
*  When it comes to Trump, all your faculties disappear. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1719.6s)]
*  Say something nice about Trump. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1720.96s)]
*  You first. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1722.8799999999999s)]
*  Go on. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1723.36s)]
*  What do you want to say nice about Trump? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1724.0s)]
*  Say something positive about Trump. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1725.12s)]
*  One thing he's ever done was good. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1726.24s)]
*  Why would I say that? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1727.4399999999998s)]
*  Because you can't. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  I can say it. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1728.96s)]
*  You can't. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1729.52s)]
*  I have said it. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1729.9199999999998s)]
*  You can't. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1730.72s)]
*  But I'm not going to play this game where a fascist- [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1730.96s)]
*  I need to contextualise the fascism. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  Hitler made the trains run on time. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1734.56s)]
*  You literally in my show earlier, you said what happened at the Madison Square Garden [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1736.48s)]
*  last night, which I was there for the six hours, first rally I've attended, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1740.8000000000002s)]
*  you said it was literally like a Nazi-style rally. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1743.76s)]
*  Do you not think- [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1747.3600000000001s)]
*  When you say something like that, I've got a lot of respect for you. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  I think you're a great broadcaster. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1750.16s)]
*  I think you're such horseshit. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1751.44s)]
*  So I have a lot of- [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1752.88s)]
*  Where's your disingenuous? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1754.96s)]
*  You know it is. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1756.16s)]
*  No. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1756.96s)]
*  You know you do. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1757.3600000000001s)]
*  That's why you're not neo-Nazi. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1758.24s)]
*  So, Pierce, Pierce. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1759.76s)]
*  You know the Nazis murdered 12 million people. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1760.4s)]
*  Nice try. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1763.28s)]
*  You know that he's not Adolf Hitler, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1763.68s)]
*  but you're quite happy with his Nazi bullshit. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1765.28s)]
*  Nice try. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1767.84s)]
*  And when Karl-Hein-Harris loses, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1768.32s)]
*  it will be because the left have over-demonised him. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1770.08s)]
*  So, as they always do. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1772.72s)]
*  By the way, it wasn't me who called him a monster, that was you. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1774.16s)]
*  So you demonised him. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1776.8799999999999s)]
*  He behaved in a monstrous manner. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1777.76s)]
*  And now you're fine with him. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1779.04s)]
*  He didn't apologise, didn't regret, hasn't changed his behaviour, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1780.56s)]
*  but Pierce is fine with him now. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1782.72s)]
*  I changed my view occasionally. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1783.76s)]
*  Why? Based on what, though? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1784.8s)]
*  You should try it. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1785.92s)]
*  The viewers are waiting. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1786.48s)]
*  Based on what? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1787.36s)]
*  What did Trump do to win you back? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1788.0s)]
*  I think Trump- [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1789.52s)]
*  What less fascist thing did he do? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1789.92s)]
*  I think Trump, in his quite brutal style, can be very effective. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1791.36s)]
*  That's not an answer to my question. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1796.6399999999999s)]
*  What did he do since January 2021 for Pierce to wake up and say, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1797.76s)]
*  he should be president again? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1800.4799999999998s)]
*  Stop shouting. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1801.6799999999998s)]
*  Let me give you an example. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  I think, for example, one of the more disingenuous things [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1804.0s)]
*  that people have attacked Trump about [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  was him saying that he wanted to get rid of NATO. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1808.4799999999998s)]
*  In fact, if you read exactly what he said about NATO, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1810.9599999999998s)]
*  what Trump wanted to do was to make countries pay their due. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1813.4399999999998s)]
*  Great. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1816.6399999999999s)]
*  To what- [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1816.9599999999998s)]
*  Hang on, hang on. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1817.36s)]
*  Well, no, no. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1818.1599999999999s)]
*  This is my show and I didn't ask about NATO. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1818.7199999999998s)]
*  I don't care about NATO. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1820.32s)]
*  You asked me to say one good thing- [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1821.2s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1823.04s)]
*  You asked me. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1823.52s)]
*  I just said it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1824.0s)]
*  Well, I'm just going to finish the point. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1824.48s)]
*  I definitely didn't ask you to come say nice things about Trump. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1825.92s)]
*  Not about NATO. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1828.48s)]
*  Not about NATO. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1829.2s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1829.76s)]
*  Time to start. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1830.16s)]
*  Him getting NATO countries to pay their due- [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1831.28s)]
*  Great. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1833.92s)]
*  Is a very successful and effective campaign by Trump. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1834.24s)]
*  You know he's going to roll over to Putin. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1836.56s)]
*  By the way, we don't have time to get into it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1837.76s)]
*  I find it astonishing. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1839.04s)]
*  He's not going to roll over to Putin. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1839.68s)]
*  Someone as anti-Putin as you is totally fine with Trump's- [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1840.64s)]
*  He will not roll over to Putin. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1842.96s)]
*  Why don't you say what he does? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1844.0s)]
*  You said you went to the rally yesterday. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1845.1200000000001s)]
*  They said Puerto Rico is a garbage island. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1846.8s)]
*  Black people- [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1849.76s)]
*  The media made a stupid dumb joke. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1850.24s)]
*  Trump's childhood friend said, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1852.0800000000002s)]
*  Kamala is the antichrist and the devil. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1853.8400000000001s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1856.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1856.72s)]
*  Immigrants being brought in as a democratic plan to replace American voters. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1858.16s)]
*  This is a kind of neo-Nazi great replacement word. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1861.76s)]
*  Immigrants are invading and occupying the UK. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1864.24s)]
*  Invasion is what Nick Griffin, for the British people watching, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1866.4s)]
*  you and I know who Nick Griffin is, far right neo-Nazi language of invasion. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1868.72s)]
*  That's what Trump used. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1872.32s)]
*  So when I make these allegations, I have evidence and facts to back them up. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1873.04s)]
*  You avoid the facts. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1877.44s)]
*  So when I say to you, for example, is Trump a racist? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1878.4s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1880.16s)]
*  I don't think he is. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  So why does he say racist stuff? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1882.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't think he's a racist. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1884.16s)]
*  I've known him- [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1885.6000000000001s)]
*  Why does he say racist stuff? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1886.48s)]
*  Why does he say racist stuff, Piers? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1887.8400000000001s)]
*  Many, I don't know. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1889.52s)]
*  But he does say racist stuff. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1890.72s)]
*  Can we agree on that? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1891.68s)]
*  No, it's a simple question. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1892.96s)]
*  This is a genuine form of- [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1893.76s)]
*  All right, all right, let's go through it then. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1894.96s)]
*  In fact, he said four women of color in Congress, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1896.0800000000002s)]
*  they should go back to where they came from. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1898.8000000000002s)]
*  Is that racist? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1899.92s)]
*  I'm not going to do this with you. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1901.1200000000001s)]
*  Why? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1902.24s)]
*  Because I don't- [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1902.96s)]
*  I give you evidence. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1903.52s)]
*  If I- [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1904.72s)]
*  I didn't ask if he's a racist. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1905.04s)]
*  I've known Trump to be racist. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1905.8400000000001s)]
*  You asked me if he's a racist. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1906.72s)]
*  You just literally just asked me. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1907.8400000000001s)]
*  And you've dodged it, so now I'm asking specific questions. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1908.8s)]
*  I'm not going to go over everything he's ever said. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1910.4s)]
*  Piers, you're not sitting in America, but from the UK. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1911.68s)]
*  I'm allowed to follow up questions. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1913.76s)]
*  He's so racist that more black Latina people are going to vote [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1914.48s)]
*  for now than ever before. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1917.44s)]
*  It's not! [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1918.72s)]
*  It's not dealing with evidence. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1919.52s)]
*  They don't think he's racist. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1920.56s)]
*  That's not how racism is defined by being involved. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1920.96s)]
*  I don't think he's racist. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1922.32s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1923.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so I'm rephrasing the question. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1924.08s)]
*  It's called a follow-up. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1925.52s)]
*  You know this. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1926.16s)]
*  You've been on an interview longer than me. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1926.64s)]
*  When he told four women of colour to go back to where they came from, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1928.1599999999999s)]
*  was that racist in your view? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1930.72s)]
*  I can't remember the quote. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1931.9199999999998s)]
*  He told Ilhan Omar, AOC, Ayanna Pressley to go back on Twitter. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1933.4399999999998s)]
*  It was very famous. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1937.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1937.76s)]
*  It was a huge- [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1938.08s)]
*  If that's what he said, then that would seem to me to be racially insensitive. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1938.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1942.24s)]
*  But not racist. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1942.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think he's a racist. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1943.9199999999998s)]
*  That's not what I asked. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1945.12s)]
*  Well, you did ask me that. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1946.32s)]
*  But now I'm asking, is it racist to tell four women of colour to go back to their countries? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1947.1999999999998s)]
*  Look- [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1950.08s)]
*  It's a very simple question. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1951.1999999999998s)]
*  You don't want to answer it because you know it's racist, Piers. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1952.32s)]
*  No, I think he has said racially insensitive comments. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  That's a cop-out. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1956.6399999999999s)]
*  But I don't think he's a racist. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1957.44s)]
*  Unsensitive Piers Morgan can't say the R word. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1958.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't think he's a racist. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1960.88s)]
*  Last question on this. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1961.92s)]
*  Do you hold the Democrats and Kamala Harris to a double standard? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1963.28s)]
*  If she had stood up at a rally and spoke about a woman's tennis player's vagina, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1966.0s)]
*  for 15 minutes, you'd have been all over it, attacking her, mocking her. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1969.76s)]
*  You weren't genuinely upset about that. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1973.2s)]
*  That's not what I asked. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1975.52s)]
*  The Arnold Farmer comment was funny. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1976.3200000000002s)]
*  I asked about you. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1977.8400000000001s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1978.8s)]
*  And would Kamala Harris have gotten away with it? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1979.52s)]
*  You know my trouble? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1981.04s)]
*  Would Kamala Harris- [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1981.68s)]
*  You don't- [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1982.48s)]
*  You know my trouble? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1982.72s)]
*  Piers, you need to answer the questions. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1983.28s)]
*  You know my trouble with people on the left? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1984.16s)]
*  You can- [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1985.68s)]
*  You can filibuster all you want. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1986.5600000000002s)]
*  I'll just ask the question at the end. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1987.6000000000001s)]
*  I still categorise myself as a liberal, by the way. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1988.24s)]
*  The problem with you lefties is you actually refuse to have a sense of humour. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  You've got one. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1995.92s)]
*  Would you- [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1996.8000000000002s)]
*  I reckon when you quietly watch him say things like the Arnold Farmer thing, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1997.2s)]
*  when you're on your own, you watch it and laugh. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=1999.92s)]
*  But what you can't be seen doing out there- [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2002.48s)]
*  That's not what I asked though. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2003.92s)]
*  It's actually laugh. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2004.72s)]
*  But I didn't ask if it's funny. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2005.44s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2006.24s)]
*  I didn't ask if it's funny. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2006.88s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2007.76s)]
*  Would you have let Kamala Harris make comments about a female tennis player's vagina for 15- [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2008.4s)]
*  You just said she should withdraw from the race. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2012.4s)]
*  Biden's got dementia. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2014.24s)]
*  I actually- [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2016.0800000000002s)]
*  You give a pass. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2016.32s)]
*  No, I would have thought a lot more of it. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2016.96s)]
*  I would have thought, my god, the woman's got a sense of humour. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2018.48s)]
*  You once asked Donald Trump when he was president to give you a job. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2021.2s)]
*  Bizarrely to make you his chief of staff. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2024.0800000000002s)]
*  He has since pretty humiliatingly attacked you as fake news. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2026.0800000000002s)]
*  His spokesman called you a failed television host. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2028.88s)]
*  If he wins next week, will you be asking him for a job again? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2031.2s)]
*  No. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2033.68s)]
*  I've got a very good job, thank you. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2034.32s)]
*  Okay, so no more jobs with Trump. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2035.68s)]
*  GQ Magazine just did a big profile piece on New and On. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2038.72s)]
*  How successful you've been on YouTube. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  You've done a lot of high-profile media jobs. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2043.76s)]
*  Editor of the Mirror, editor of New the World, host on CNN, host on Good Morning Britain. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2045.44s)]
*  Haven't all ended well for you? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2048.88s)]
*  How does hosting peers- [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2050.48s)]
*  Actually, they have all ended well for me. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2051.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2053.76s)]
*  In other words, I ended up doing something better after. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2054.24s)]
*  That's true. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2056.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2056.72s)]
*  I'm in the same boat. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2057.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2058.32s)]
*  How does hosting peers uncensored right now on YouTube [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2058.96s)]
*  compare to all those previous jobs in the US and the UK? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2061.6s)]
*  Well, what I like about it is, I actually like having almost a ringmaster role. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2064.8s)]
*  Because I think there's so much polarization now going on. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2070.48s)]
*  Both left and right. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2073.12s)]
*  There are very few places to go where you can have genuinely good spirited debate. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2074.56s)]
*  We just had one, actually, earlier with you. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2078.64s)]
*  And Sarah Palin and Dave Smith and Destiny. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2081.44s)]
*  I really enjoyed it. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2083.12s)]
*  I like that. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2084.56s)]
*  I think it's different to anything I've done before. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2085.2799999999997s)]
*  I like being at the center of people who are very smart. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2087.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's my criteria. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2090.64s)]
*  You've got to be smart. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2091.52s)]
*  Come on and debate stuff. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2092.24s)]
*  Sarah Palin? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2093.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2094.64s)]
*  In her way, she's smart. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2094.96s)]
*  She's not your idea of intelligent, perhaps. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2096.48s)]
*  But the reason she got to be vice president was she's not- [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2098.88s)]
*  She wasn't vice president at Peer She Lost. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2100.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, sorry. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2102.48s)]
*  I take your point. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2103.76s)]
*  Cabinet. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2104.4s)]
*  Running mate. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2104.72s)]
*  Running mate. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2105.36s)]
*  I think that I like being at the fulcrum of having people with very strong views on both sides. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2106.32s)]
*  And doing exactly what you've been doing with me quite adeptly as you're a very good interviewer. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2112.88s)]
*  But going after people on both sides and trying to, if we can, reach points of some agreement. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2117.2s)]
*  Because actually, that's what used to happen in democratic societies. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2122.88s)]
*  And we've lost that. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2125.92s)]
*  I really do think one of the great tragedies of modern day is that people can't have- [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2126.72s)]
*  You and I, we have regular, pretty full on debates, don't we? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2131.2s)]
*  And we go after each other. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2135.2799999999997s)]
*  But at the end of it, we shake hands, we smile, we move on. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2136.4s)]
*  I think it's good. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2138.96s)]
*  And I think that, like I said, the interesting thing for me, on that first time you came on, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2139.68s)]
*  and you took me on about the apparent double standard. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2144.64s)]
*  And I got your point about Russia and Ukraine and Israel-Gaza. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2147.2799999999997s)]
*  It made me go away and think. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2151.04s)]
*  And I'm not afraid to then say, I thought about that. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2152.32s)]
*  And actually, you were right. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2154.56s)]
*  There's a double standard there. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2156.0s)]
*  So what do I really think? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2157.04s)]
*  I think that is part of democracy. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2158.48s)]
*  I think that's part of actually evolving as a human being. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2160.48s)]
*  And not being afraid to change your mind when people present you with a fact which should change your mind. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2164.08s)]
*  And that closure of minds to that kind of thing, I think, is ruinous for society. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2169.04s)]
*  You're an Arsenal fan. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2173.68s)]
*  I'm a Liverpool fan. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2174.72s)]
*  Should we call this a score draw? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2175.44s)]
*  2-2. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2176.88s)]
*  Fine. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2177.84s)]
*  Thank you for coming on May the Uncensored. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2178.72s)]
*  It was good fun. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2180.4s)]
*  You just said May the Uncensored. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2182.48s)]
*  Oh, shit! [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzkw3fzqR6M&t=2183.92s)]
