Video Description: Every week, it seems like Trump signs new executive orders to tighten his chokehold on Americans’ rights and freedoms – except for his billionaire friends, of course. But the fight doesn’t end when Trump signs the piece of paper. Rather, it’s just the beginning as ordinary people and grassroots organizations take Trump’s draconian policies to court. One of those organizations pushing back against Trump is the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, better known as FIRE, which is centered around defending and promoting free speech for all Americans. Executive Vice President of FIRE, Nico Perrino, tells Mehdi that despite defending free speech for Republicans and Democrats alike, “most people are free speech hypocrites.”

As the Trump administration doubles down on deporting college students without due process, Perrino argues, “That’s completely contrary to all American traditions, and even targeting visa holders and lawful permanent residents with Green Cards for their protected speech is totally contrary to the American principles.” Despite criticizing the left for free speech restrictions in the past, Perrino concedes to Mehdi that “what we're seeing right now in scope, scale, and severity [from the right] is worse.”

# The Right is “Rationalizing the Abuses” to Free Speech: First Amendment Watchdog on MAGA
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo)
*  This is a confusing time to live in the United States. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=0.0s)]
*  The line between what is legal and illegal is being blurred daily. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=3.0s)]
*  The line between justice and injustice seems to have been wiped out. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=6.36s)]
*  And the law, any law, seems to be open to whichever interpretation the Trump administration [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=9.68s)]
*  deems fit. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=13.88s)]
*  Every week we hear stories like that of Rumeysa Ozturk, an innocent Turkish student with a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=15.22s)]
*  Fulbright scholarship who was taken by ICE and flown far away to a detention center where [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=19.0s)]
*  the chances of getting her deported are higher. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  Her crime? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=26.0s)]
*  Publishing an op-ed in the university's paper. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=27.2s)]
*  No much for free speech. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=29.72s)]
*  Every week it seems we find Trump signing new executive orders that tighten his chokehold [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=31.72s)]
*  on people's rights. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=35.0s)]
*  Except those of billionaires, of course. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=36.0s)]
*  One organization that proudly pushed back against what they described in the past as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=38.32s)]
*  left-wing efforts to restrict speech and at the time were praised by conservatives and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=41.82s)]
*  is now pushing back against Trump and MAGA is FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=46.92s)]
*  in Education, whose mission centers around defending and promoting free speech. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And its executive vice president, Nico Perino, joins me now. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=55.88s)]
*  Nico, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=58.8s)]
*  Glad to be here, Matty. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=60.08s)]
*  So, your organization does a lot of free speech work, obviously, the kind of clues in the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=61.08s)]
*  name. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=66.24s)]
*  Have you ever been this busy? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=67.47999999999999s)]
*  Have you ever faced challenges, the kind of which we're seeing right now, to the First [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  Amendment? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=71.84s)]
*  Yeah, I was talking with our legal director last week and he said in his career he's never [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=72.84s)]
*  seen this scope, this scale and this severity of what we've seen in, what is it, less than [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  three months at this point. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  I could go down the list. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=82.24s)]
*  We're deporting visa holders, lawful permanent residents who are doing nothing more than speaking [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=83.6s)]
*  their minds. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=88.04s)]
*  We are going after colleges and universities, revoking their federal funding, conditioning [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=89.2s)]
*  future federal funding on implementing speech codes, violating academic freedom, reforming [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=93.32000000000001s)]
*  student disciplinary processes, going after disfavored law firms that represent clients [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=97.80000000000001s)]
*  that the administration doesn't like. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=102.4s)]
*  The Associated Press apparently can't adopt its own editorial standards lest it get booted [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  out of the White House press pool. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=108.64000000000001s)]
*  We have a U.S. attorney here in the District of Columbia that thinks he is Trump's personal [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=110.68s)]
*  attorney going after critics. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=115.4s)]
*  And then you have Trump himself who's filing lawsuits against journalists and media organizations, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=117.2s)]
*  essentially extorting them for tens of millions of dollars. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=121.92s)]
*  And you have an FCC that is helping him in this enterprise. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=125.76s)]
*  So this is, what, three months now? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=129.44s)]
*  I venture to guess where it's going to go in the next four years, but we're doing our [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=131.96s)]
*  best. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=134.84s)]
*  And we didn't even get started on Elon Musk saying to jail CBS journalists, put them in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=135.84s)]
*  prison because he doesn't like their editing skills. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=139.24s)]
*  And last week he said that they were going after people who proffered lies and propaganda [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=141.5s)]
*  about Tesla. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=145.52s)]
*  Apparently you're not allowed to lie about Tesla. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  That's against the Constitution. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  Apparently, yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  You're also very generous about AAP. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=149.88000000000002s)]
*  It's not even an editorial guidelines. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=151.88000000000002s)]
*  It's just stating what the entire world thinks that it's the Gulf of Mexico. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  Your organization is one of the few that has been pretty consistent on the issue of free [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  speech on this particular constitutional right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=160.12s)]
*  You have defended free speech in the face of infringement by Republicans and Democrats [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=163.5s)]
*  alike. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  I think it's fair to say. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  Of course, when you did it while Biden was president, a lot more conservatives took your [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  side. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  But now that they're doing the infringing, have you seen many of your allies turn into [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=175.0s)]
*  foes? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=179.72s)]
*  One of the things that I've learned that's always a truism in free speech work is that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=181.0s)]
*  most people are free speech hypocrites. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=185.04s)]
*  John Stewart had this great line that he said, when the only time you stand on principle [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=186.96s)]
*  is when your side stands to benefit from it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=191.52s)]
*  It's not a principle. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=195.0s)]
*  It's a hobby. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=196.0s)]
*  We have a lot of free speech hobbyists at the moment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=197.0s)]
*  We've lost donors. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=199.1s)]
*  We've lost friends. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=200.24s)]
*  We have to acknowledge that we're willing to drive this bus into a wall, if that's what [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=202.34s)]
*  it means to stay principled. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=205.1s)]
*  But even though I acknowledge that free speech hypocrisy exists, I've been disappointed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  I've been disappointed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=213.22s)]
*  And you just have to accept that you have no permanent friends and no permanent enemies. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=214.22s)]
*  Make friends where you can and make enemies where you have to, I guess. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  So I have to ask this question. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=222.86s)]
*  You say free speech hypocrisy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=224.38s)]
*  Do you believe conservatives were ever pro-free speech? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=226.22s)]
*  Because we can be disappointed, as you say, to use your word, about the heel turn on the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=230.7s)]
*  issue of the First Amendment, on the issue of cancel culture. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=234.86s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=237.14s)]
*  They were obsessed with that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=238.14s)]
*  I remember the Charlie Hebdo affair where Muslims were told, you need to understand [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=239.14s)]
*  that being offensive is a Western value. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=242.98s)]
*  All of that stuff. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=245.34s)]
*  Were they ever pro-free speech? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=248.46s)]
*  Or even at the time when Biden was in office and you had all these supporters and donors, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=249.98s)]
*  were someone like you recognizing, well, they could switch tomorrow? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=253.54s)]
*  We always recognize that they could switch tomorrow. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=256.98s)]
*  And I don't want to paint with too broad a brush. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=258.86s)]
*  I think there are some principled conservatives out there. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  But I have been disappointed not just with not aligning with us, not coming to our defense [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=264.06s)]
*  when we're going after these free speech infringements, but more just staying silent or rationalizing [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=269.4s)]
*  the abuses. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=275.82s)]
*  So for our friends, it's rationalization. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=277.06s)]
*  For our enemies, it's repudiation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=280.34s)]
*  It's been largely disappointing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=282.70000000000005s)]
*  But we know that anytime the shoe is on the other foot, that free speech defenders tend [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=285.90000000000003s)]
*  to stay quiet. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=293.18s)]
*  Liking this video? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=294.74s)]
*  Then don't just watch. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=295.74s)]
*  Hit like, share and subscribe. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=296.90000000000003s)]

*  So what about the criticism of not specifically your organizations, but people like yourself [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=310.86s)]
*  who were very vocal during the Biden era? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=315.78s)]
*  I don't know if you saw John McWhorter, the academic New York Times columnist, just in [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=318.14s)]
*  an interview recently with the Free Press where he talked about both sides. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=322.38s)]
*  And a lot of people on the left, liberals, have been very critical of that framing. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=326.26s)]
*  And they would argue that perhaps groups like yours laid the groundwork for this by making [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  such a big issue about campus protests against Milo Yiannopoulos or some of the cancel culture [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=334.78s)]
*  excesses, microaggression excesses. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  I think we all recognize have happened on college campus at some point or another. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=344.17999999999995s)]
*  But in hindsight, they all look a little minimal, inconsequential when you now have a government [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=348.02s)]
*  basically going after the First Amendment, going after the Free Press, going after law [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=354.46s)]
*  firms, as you so eloquently listed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=358.09999999999997s)]
*  State repression is much worse than some oversensitive college kids. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=361.06s)]
*  We can all agree, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=365.26s)]
*  Well, in some cases, you have colleges that are the state, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=366.42s)]
*  These are public colleges and universities. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=369.66s)]
*  So we need to take that into account. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=371.46s)]
*  Private universities are not bound by the First Amendment. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=373.18s)]
*  Often they promise free speech and academic freedom rights, which in some states they're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=375.46s)]
*  contractually bound to respect. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=378.66s)]
*  But you take my broader point. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=380.78s)]
*  But I take your broader point, yes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=382.62s)]
*  So we can have a debate as to whether this infringement is worse or that infringement [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=383.86s)]
*  is worse. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=388.32s)]
*  I think it conceded that what we're seeing right now in scope, scale, and severity is [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=389.32s)]
*  worse. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=392.76s)]
*  But we're a free speech organization. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=393.76s)]
*  Where we see free speech violations, we need to call them out, regardless of whether they [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=395.92s)]
*  are more severe in this instance than in another instance. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=400.88s)]
*  And I think what you have seen in the past decade are conservatives who were concerned [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=404.74s)]
*  about what they had seen as censorship of their side. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=409.12s)]
*  And they had made an institution out of this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=413.36s)]
*  But it wasn't the censorship that was the problem. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=415.8s)]
*  It was the censorship of their side. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=417.48s)]
*  They're happy to censor once they're in power. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=419.32s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=421.36s)]
*  And then so the question becomes, do you ignore these violations because you tend to have [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=422.44s)]
*  more allies in one particular instance or in one particular period because you're worried [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=427.08s)]
*  of the backlash that might come down the line? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=431.74s)]
*  Or do you take the infringements as they come and hope that over time your consistency will [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=434.96s)]
*  be recognized by all sides? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=439.38s)]
*  No, I recognize your consistency. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=441.08s)]
*  But I am saying that we need some kind of hierarchy, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=442.56s)]
*  So if we look at, for example, college campuses, what liberals and woke folks were accused [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=444.96000000000004s)]
*  of doing, the censorship that you say. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=450.0s)]
*  OK, for example, I remember Charles Murray spoke at some college and people shouted and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  screamed. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  Michigan and he was at Middlebury. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=458.52000000000004s)]
*  And there were protests against conservative speakers, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=459.52000000000004s)]
*  And that was seen, I'm sure, by your organization as not a good thing. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=462.12s)]
*  No, no. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=464.92s)]
*  We don't. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=465.92s)]
*  Well, in the Middlebury case, you had student protesters that were attacking him and his [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=466.92s)]
*  interlocker. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=470.72s)]
*  No one supports physical, mob censorship. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=471.72s)]
*  So in terms of actual people disrupting events and standing outside and saying we shouldn't [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=473.56s)]
*  have this person at university and we don't like that, I'm assuming it was bad from FIRE's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=478.08s)]
*  perspective. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=482.24s)]
*  But then when you compare that to what is happening now on college campuses where students [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=483.46s)]
*  are literally being disappeared, Pinochet style, it's apples and oranges, we can agree. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=487.16s)]
*  When you look at any censorship case in comparison to another censorship case, there's always [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=492.4s)]
*  going to be relative severity. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=498.56s)]
*  But yes, anytime you use the power of the state, and we have said this repeatedly, even [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=500.6s)]
*  in during the cancel culture debate, anytime you use the power of the state to go after [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=504.36s)]
*  political dissenters, ideological opponents, that's always going to be worse. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=508.64000000000004s)]
*  And right now what you see is the full weight and power of the state coming down on dissenters. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=513.0s)]
*  The Trump administration is doing that by using a very controversial, some would say [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=518.38s)]
*  unconstitutional clause of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act to carry out these deportations [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=522.2s)]
*  or detentions and attempted deportations based on the Secretary of State, who right now [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=528.02s)]
*  is Marco Rubio, just deciding that someone, a foreign student, an H1B visa holder, a [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=532.42s)]
*  green card holder, permanent resident, poses a threat, could seriously, adversely affect [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=539.42s)]
*  the foreign policy of the United States merely by their presence and by their speech. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=545.8199999999999s)]
*  Now Congress passed a limit on that law in the early 90s which said you could only do [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=550.86s)]
*  that if a particular foreigner's mere presence in the United States would somehow violate [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=555.0s)]
*  a treaty or if it could result in imminent harm to the lives or property of Americans [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=558.68s)]
*  abroad. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=563.36s)]
*  When you look at Mahmoud Khalil or some of these other examples, the Turkish student [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=564.36s)]
*  at Tufts who I mentioned in the introduction, do any of those cases fit that description? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=569.3199999999999s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=573.52s)]
*  Yeah, you have the Tufts student who writes an op-ed and apparently this is so adverse [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=574.52s)]
*  to American foreign policy that its consequences are so great that you have the Secretary of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=578.56s)]
*  State booting the student out of the country. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  And I should also note a lot of this is done with very minimal due process. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=585.1600000000001s)]
*  You don't actually know what these people are charged with. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=588.64s)]
*  If you look at the Notice to Appear document, which is the document in these immigration [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=590.5400000000001s)]
*  proceedings, all it lists is the Secretary of State's authority to deport these folks. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=593.84s)]
*  Well, Jamie Vance told Fox recently, the Vice President, that these people don't have due [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  process. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=601.52s)]
*  If you're not a citizen you don't get due process apparently. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=602.52s)]
*  That's completely contrary to all American traditions and even targeting visa holders [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=603.9200000000001s)]
*  in lawful permanent residence with green cards for their protected speech is totally contrary [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=608.22s)]
*  to the American principles. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=613.08s)]
*  I mean the Declaration of Independence says that governments are instituted among men [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  to protect their rights. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=618.96s)]
*  These rights are not given by government. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=620.6s)]
*  So to the extent these people are here in the United States, subject to United States [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=622.24s)]
*  jurisdiction, we recognize that they have the God-given right to freedom of speech. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=626.12s)]
*  They can't be violated just because they're not a United States citizen. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=630.84s)]
*  That's completely contrary to American founding documents. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=634.28s)]
*  But here we have an administration that thinks, no, they not only don't have free speech rights, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=637.1600000000001s)]
*  they don't have due process rights either. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=641.32s)]
*  And this argument that, oh well, they don't need due process, they're terrorists, they're [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=643.5200000000001s)]
*  gang members, et cetera. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=647.5200000000001s)]
*  A lot of people have made this point, I just want to get your take on this, that if you [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=648.96s)]
*  don't offer even the worst people, even the worst terrorist gang member allegedly their [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=652.12s)]
*  rights, then how does that protect American citizens? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=658.24s)]
*  Because surely if ICE can just decide that someone's a gang member, as they've done [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=661.8000000000001s)]
*  with for example Mr. Abrego Garcia who was sent to El Salvador even though he had protected [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=666.2s)]
*  status from Maryland, if they can just say, well, you're a terrorist, you're a gang member, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=669.8s)]
*  off you go, then what's to stop them from pointing an American citizen and doing that? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=674.76s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=678.7199999999999s)]
*  And this is why due process is so important. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=679.7199999999999s)]
*  The government needs to show its work. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=681.4799999999999s)]
*  The defense needs the opportunity to present evidence that they aren't what the government [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=684.12s)]
*  says they are. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=687.8399999999999s)]
*  Even if you accept that the Secretary of State should have this authority, this unilateral [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=688.9599999999999s)]
*  authority to deport someone, and I question that. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=693.5799999999999s)]
*  I question whether that authority is constitutional. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=697.16s)]
*  Indeed, the only time it has come before a court was in the late 90s and early 2000s [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=699.36s)]
*  when it went before Trump's sister. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=705.68s)]
*  And she thought that it was… [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=708.24s)]
*  Yes, Mary Ann Trump-Berry late. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=709.24s)]
*  Yeah, Mary Ann Trump-Berry. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=710.76s)]
*  And she thought it was unconstitutional exercise of executive power. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=712.26s)]
*  It was later overturned on procedural grounds, not those merits. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=716.7199999999999s)]
*  But even if you accept that authority, you still need to have due process to be able [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=720.48s)]
*  to adjudicate what it means to be seriously adverse to American foreign policy interests. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=725.84s)]
*  And we're not having any of that at the moment. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=730.4000000000001s)]
*  We mentioned the media early, the AP and some of the crackdowns from Trump and Musk and co. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=733.24s)]
*  The media is clearly on the receiving end of a lot of pressure from the administration. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=737.84s)]
*  But how complicit do you think our media is in this assault by Trump on our values? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=742.2800000000001s)]
*  Because you've seen media organizations rolling over in many cases, the ABC settlement of [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=747.8000000000001s)]
*  they could have won. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=753.12s)]
*  CBS might settle another ridiculous lawsuit from Trump. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=754.12s)]
*  You've seen other media organizations not really solidly standing with the AP kind of [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=757.68s)]
*  doing very kind of minimal gestures of support. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=761.96s)]
*  How worried are you that the media is just going to roll over in the face of all of this? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=766.36s)]
*  You've got Jeff Bezos, of course, owner of the Washington Post, big Trump supporter now. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=769.16s)]
*  We need a free press, an independent free press. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=773.76s)]
*  Yes, yes we do. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=775.72s)]
*  I am worried not only that they will roll over, but they already have. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=776.92s)]
*  And behavior that gets rewarded gets repeated. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=780.8s)]
*  And so when you have Trump filing baseless lawsuits, not just against traditional media [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=783.3599999999999s)]
*  organizations, but also the Metas and the Xs of the world, and then he comes into office [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  and they immediately settle for tens of millions of dollars, this is just protection money. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=792.68s)]
*  This is just protection money that they're paying. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=797.68s)]
*  And you're going to see more organizations start to cave, particularly where they want [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=799.92s)]
*  to have a merger or an acquisition in the case of CBS, for example. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=804.5999999999999s)]
*  And you have the FCC that needs to grant them permission. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=809.28s)]
*  Which is led by Trump or Brendan Carr? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=812.72s)]
*  Led by Brendan Carr, who talk about free speech hypocrisy for the last decade has been talking [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=815.0799999999999s)]
*  about how we need to rein in the FCC, how he's the First Amendment champion on that [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=819.8s)]
*  board. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=823.68s)]
*  He was just at a meeting last week with the DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=824.68s)]
*  What did he wear on his lapel? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=828.6s)]
*  It wasn't an American flag pin as politicians often wear. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=829.6s)]
*  It was a gold Trump lapel emblem of his face. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=833.1999999999999s)]
*  Now, that's about as Soviet, that's about as Maoist as it gets. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=837.3199999999999s)]
*  It's become a cult of personality in a certain respect. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=841.92s)]
*  And you have interim US attorney Ed Martin, here in the District of Columbia, saying [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=844.4399999999999s)]
*  that he's Trump's personal attorney. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=849.52s)]
*  So the fact that- [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=851.88s)]
*  And going on Twitter and saying, hey, send me stuff that you don't like and I'll look [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=852.88s)]
*  into people. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=855.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=856.64s)]
*  And people are doing it. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=857.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=858.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=859.64s)]
*  Looking into people's tweets. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=860.64s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember when the Right had a breakdown over the Biden administration [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=861.64s)]
*  saying, hey, don't put COVID misinformation on Facebook. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=863.72s)]
*  And now apparently the district attorney in DC can look into people's tweets at a critical [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=866.36s)]
*  of Trump. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  I remember when civil libertarians were concerned about the see something, say something mantra [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=872.8000000000001s)]
*  that the executive branch pushed out. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=877.7600000000001s)]
*  I remember when they went after colleges and universities for their bias reporting programs, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  where if you see bias on campus reported to the administration, we'll bring them in for [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=884.88s)]
*  a conversation and potentially punishment. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=888.2800000000001s)]
*  Now you have the interim US attorney in the District of Columbia doing the same exact [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=890.32s)]
*  thing with the full force of federal government behind them. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=895.28s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  It is scary. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=898.6800000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=899.6800000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk has often claimed to be a free speech absolutist. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=901.28s)]
*  Have we seen any evidence of his free speech absolutism since this administration came [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=904.36s)]
*  to office with his money and support? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=909.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=910.76s)]
*  And we didn't see any evidence of it even after he took over X. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=911.76s)]
*  We were fairly optimistic that when he took over X, maybe some of the censorship that [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=914.84s)]
*  we'd seen, some of the ham-fisted censorship that we'd seen on X would be better. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=918.36s)]
*  But we wrote very quickly, I think maybe two or three months after that on our website, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=922.12s)]
*  that he was a false prophet, that he wasn't the free speech prophet or savior that he [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=926.12s)]
*  thought he was. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=929.96s)]
*  So I've been immensely disappointed with that. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=930.96s)]
*  And he's alienated some of his allies early on, the Matt Taibes of the world, for example. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=932.6s)]
*  And Matt told me when I interviewed him, he said, the problem is power. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=939.5600000000001s)]
*  When you have power, the allure of censorship is so strong that most people can't resist [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=944.12s)]
*  it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=949.72s)]
*  With Elon Musk, that's what you're seeing with Donald Trump. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=951.12s)]
*  Donald Trump came into office on a wave of, he's here to protect free speech. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=953.76s)]
*  I question that. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=958.2s)]
*  I saw some of the things that happened under his first administration. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=959.6s)]
*  He threatened journalists while he was running for president. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=962.6800000000001s)]
*  It was insane to think that this guy was going to protect free speech. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=964.64s)]
*  He talked about using lawsuits against journalists, knowing that he wouldn't win defamation lawsuits, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=966.96s)]
*  but he wanted to make their lives miserable. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=972.1600000000001s)]
*  He's on the record saying that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  That's no way that someone with power should act in the United States of America. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=975.0s)]
*  Last question, Nico. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=978.56s)]
*  How much of the damage done to individual and group rights and freedoms here in the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=979.56s)]
*  US, even in this first three months? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=984.0s)]
*  We know it's going to be a long four years. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=986.72s)]
*  How much of it is reversible? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=988.1999999999999s)]
*  How much of this can be protected? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=989.72s)]
*  How much of it may be gone forever? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=990.96s)]
*  It depends whether the courts hold up. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=993.92s)]
*  So with the law firms that have been targeted for taking on controversial or dissenting [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=996.56s)]
*  clients and causes, you have seen some of those law firms cave. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1001.68s)]
*  Scadden, for example, saying that they will spend $100 million on causes that the Trump [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1006.3199999999999s)]
*  administration supports. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1011.0s)]
*  Paul Weiss, for example, caving. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1012.12s)]
*  But you had Perkins Cooey, for example, that stood firm, created a whole splash page on [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  his website about how he was fighting back. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1018.4399999999999s)]
*  And then you did just have an amicus brief filed by 500 different law firms. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1020.0799999999999s)]
*  There is security in numbers. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1024.56s)]
*  And so the more that people come together, the more that they protect themselves, the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1027.2s)]
*  more they stand up to these abuses, the more optimistic I become. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1031.44s)]
*  But if you cave, like a lot of these media institutions have done, I think it's only [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1035.76s)]
*  going to get worse. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1039.4s)]
*  If only the media organizations and the universities were to do what some of these law firms are [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1040.4s)]
*  slowly doing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1043.6s)]
*  Niko Pruna, thank you so much for your time. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1044.6s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1046.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_lQqixiKJo&t=1047.12s)]
