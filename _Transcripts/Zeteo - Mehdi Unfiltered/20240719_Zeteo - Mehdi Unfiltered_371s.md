# Why The Media's Coverage Around Trump's RNC Speech Was So Awful
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk)
*  On Thursday afternoon, six hours before Donald Trump walked on stage at the RNC in Milwaukee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=0.0s)]
*  to accept the GOP presidential nomination for a third time and give his big speech, a Politico [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=5.16s)]
*  reporter tweeted out a new piece she had just co-authored. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  And this was the tweet, quote, there appears to be a new softness to Donald Trump with [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=14.72s)]
*  people who've talked to him, describing him with words like existential, serene, emotional [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=19.56s)]
*  and even spiritual. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=24.94s)]
*  The piece itself was headlined, a changed Trump? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=27.0s)]
*  That tweet and that piece capped off a week of post-assassination attempt, hot takes from [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=32.32s)]
*  politicians, pundits, headline writers, claiming Donald Trump was a changed man and would be [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=38.36s)]
*  delivering his message to the RNC in a new tone, a new unifying tone. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=43.64s)]
*  Now I'm old enough to remember all the times in 2016 and 2017 and 2018 and 2020 when we [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  were told by journalists in America that Trump had a new tone. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=56.6s)]
*  He was a new man. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=59.86s)]
*  And those journalists made fools of themselves every single time. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=61.56s)]
*  As they did on Thursday night as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=66.26s)]
*  Because six hours after that Politico tweet, Donald Trump gave his big speech at the RNC [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=68.58s)]
*  and sure he spent the first 10, 15 minutes of his ridiculously long 90-minute speech, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=73.32s)]
*  the longest convention acceptance speech for more than 50 years, speaking quietly, seriously, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=78.64s)]
*  somberly, sticking closely to the teleprompter script and talking about how he was almost [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=84.88s)]
*  assassinated last weekend, but God intervened. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=89.44s)]
*  But then, then the Trump we all know, the ranting, raving, racist, verbally abusive, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=93.44s)]
*  narcissistic Trump, that that Trump came out to play. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=99.92s)]
*  And there was no new tone, no pitch for unity. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=104.16s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=107.2s)]
*  Roll the tape. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=109.2s)]
*  Every week they get another subpoena from the Democrats, crazy Nancy Pelosi, the whole [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=110.8s)]
*  thing just boom, boom, boom. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=116.64s)]
*  They've got to stop that because they're destroying our country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=123.6s)]
*  I call it an invasion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=127.16s)]
*  We gave our military almost $800 billion. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=129.16s)]
*  I said, I'm going to take a little of that money because this is an invasion. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=132.48s)]
*  And the next day I was called by everybody. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=136.32s)]
*  I couldn't take all the calls. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=138.68s)]
*  Sir, sir, what's the problem? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=139.96s)]
*  I said, you won't take your killers back that you sent in caravans into America. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  You won't take them back. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=147.36s)]
*  The late, great Hannibal Lecter. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=148.44s)]
*  He'd love to have you for dinner. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=153.08s)]
*  That's insane as salams. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  They're emptying out their insane as salams. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=160.36s)]
*  And terrorists are coming in at numbers that we've never seen before. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=163.32s)]
*  Bad things are going to happen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=166.60000000000002s)]
*  The Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=168.2s)]
*  of our country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  I don't even mention it, frankly, because of what happened with the China virus. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=175.07999999999998s)]
*  If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States, think of it, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=181.0s)]
*  the 10 worst added them up. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=187.16s)]
*  They will not have done the damage that Biden has done. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=189.12s)]
*  The election result. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  We're never going to let that happen again. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  They use COVID to cheat. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=196.4s)]
*  You're never going to let it happen again. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=197.72s)]
*  Crazy Nancy Pelosi, China virus, Hannibal Lecter. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=201.8s)]
*  They use COVID to cheat in the election. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=204.82s)]
*  That's the new tone. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=207.32s)]
*  Then there were the lies. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=208.32s)]
*  Trump, as ever, lied and lied and lied about the rate of inflation, about his handling [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=210.08s)]
*  of COVID, about the world being at peace when he left office, about the economy being the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=214.08s)]
*  greatest economy in human history on his watch. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=218.28s)]
*  Look, Donald J. Trump will never change. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=221.68s)]
*  But you know who else will never change? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=225.18s)]
*  Our media. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=227.58s)]
*  Our political reporters, our cable news pundits who continue to embarrass themselves while [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  actively and repeatedly misleading their viewers and their listeners and their readers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  The media has regressed back to its 2016 state, excited at the prospect of another Trump presidency, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  giving him and his acolytes pass after pass, grading him on a curve, treating him and his [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=246.38s)]
*  far right MAGA movement as a normal political party, rather than as the deranged and dishonest [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=250.94s)]
*  authoritarians and neo-fascists that they clearly are. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=256.62s)]
*  But you can't say that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=260.26s)]
*  Oh no, you can't say that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=261.26s)]
*  I went on Piers Morgan's show earlier this week and he did the both sides game on the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=263.58s)]
*  issue of political violence and incitement. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=267.78s)]
*  He wanted his viewers to think that liberals and progressives have been as violent and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=269.9s)]
*  as divisive as conservatives, as Republicans, which is of course false. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=273.56s)]
*  He was mad that people like me have condemned Trump for sounding like Adolf Hitler and for [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=279.26s)]
*  praising Nazis. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=283.5s)]
*  Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, called his opponent Hitler Gestapo two months ago. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=285.38s)]
*  This is fantastic. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=288.53999999999996s)]
*  You deflect on every single question I've asked you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  Because you are so one-sided, Piers, so I have to give some balance to this show. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=291.3s)]
*  I'm just asking, do you think people should stop calling him Hitler? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=294.34s)]
*  Because obviously it's a ridiculous... [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=296.82s)]
*  And I've already said to you, when he stops... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=298.3s)]
*  I promise, Piers, let's do a deal. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=299.9s)]
*  I promise if Trump stops quoting and acting like Hitler and quoting Hitler and praising [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  Hitler and praising Nazis, I promise never to mention Hitler again. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=306.02s)]
*  So, once again, you actually don't want to stop calling him Hitler, even though you know [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=309.38s)]
*  he's wrong. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=313.94s)]
*  No, once again, you don't want to engage with the rhetoric. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=314.94s)]
*  This is like your new Hamas gotcha question. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=317.46s)]
*  The substance of this, Piers, is that Trump has praised Nazis at Charlottesville, hosted [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=319.38s)]
*  a Nazi for dinner at his house and quotes from Mein Kampf. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=323.42s)]
*  You're telling me, the great free-spin champion, I should not be allowed to point that out [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=326.42s)]
*  because someone like you will say, I'm calling him Hitler. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=329.14s)]
*  No, I'm pointing out facts, Piers. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=331.06s)]
*  If you don't like facts, what's the line your friend Ben Shapiro says? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=332.53999999999996s)]
*  Facts don't care about your feelings. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=335.58s)]
*  They don't care about feelings at all. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=336.58s)]
*  What's so ironic is that last night Trump, while exaggerating the rate of inflation in [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=338.3s)]
*  America right now under Joe Biden, invoked the hyperinflation of the Weimar era. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=342.22s)]
*  That was his analogy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=348.3s)]
*  Biden's America, now Weimar Germany then. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=349.90000000000003s)]
*  What an interesting historical analogy to pick, to say out loud, because we all know [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=354.38s)]
*  what, we all know who came after Weimar Germany. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=359.1s)]
*  Yeah, Adolf Hitler. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR-KlKyxhXk&t=364.22s)]
