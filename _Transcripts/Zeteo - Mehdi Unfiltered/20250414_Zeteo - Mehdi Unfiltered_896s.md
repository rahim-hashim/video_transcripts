Video Description: Billionaire and shadow president Elon Musk tried to flip an election earlier this month, spending $25 million on the race, even handing out $1 million checks to voters — to no avail. Democrats had a rare win when Wisconsin voters elected judge Susan Crawford.

On ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’, Wisconsin Congressman Mark Pocan joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss that victory, as well as Musk’s increasingly alarming role in US politics.

“At the end of the day, this was people saying, ‘I don't like what's going on right now with the Trump-Musk agenda. And my only way to express that is to get out and vote in this April, normally sleepy, election.’"

Watch the full interview to hear Mehdi press Pocan on the state of the Democratic Party and if Chuck Schumer should resign, what Pocan makes of Donald Trump’s stock market crash, and if AIPAC is creating a disconnect between Democrats and their voters.

# Can Democrats Stop Elon Musk from ‘Decimating the Government’?
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU)
*  It's been almost three months since President Donald Trump began his second term in office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=0.0s)]
*  Almost three months of agency shutdowns, mass deportations, and blatant fascism. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=5.32s)]
*  And yet Democrats have yet to demonstrate a comprehensive plan for fighting back against [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=10.48s)]
*  Trump even as the stock market is crashing on his watch. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=14.88s)]
*  Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer continues to face a major internal backlash [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=19.2s)]
*  over his decision a couple of weeks ago to side with Trump and his spending bill, with [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=23.22s)]
*  several House Democrats going as far as to call for him to resign. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=27.92s)]
*  And with Democrats having a bad map for the 2026 Senate race, no popular leaders running [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  the show right now, and a record low approval rating at 27%, it's clear that something needs [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=36.56s)]
*  to change if the Democrats are going to get themselves out of the hole that they've dug [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  themselves into. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=45.64s)]
*  There is one bright spot on the horizon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=47.06s)]
*  They just won a major Supreme Court race in Wisconsin and pushed back against Elon Musk's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=48.64s)]
*  money. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=54.0s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss all of this and more is Wisconsin Congressman Mark Pocan. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=55.08s)]
*  Congressman Pocan, thank you for joining me on the show. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=59.68s)]
*  I've got to ask before we go any further, I do want to talk a lot about the politics [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=61.96s)]
*  of this moment, but just on the economics of it, we're beginning this week with more [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=65.64s)]
*  bloodletting in the markets. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=71.88s)]
*  This is a Republican president who apparently cares about stock markets and prices. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  What do you make of what's going on? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=77.72s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump has no clue what he's doing, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=79.44s)]
*  He spent the weekend golfing when he should have been dealing with an economic crisis [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=82.88s)]
*  that he created through just having across the board tariffs without really a plan or [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=86.84s)]
*  rhyme or reason. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, there's a lot of reason to be nervous going back into Washington. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  And I think you're even maybe going to have a Republican to express some nervousness as [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=98.32s)]
*  well because this is a, I won't use the word on TV, but a show. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=103.96s)]
*  So there is this moment where Trump is starting to look vulnerable, weak, dare we say, especially [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=110.44s)]
*  on the economy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=116.44s)]
*  Just a few weeks ago, you had this spending bill that went through where Chuck Schumer [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=117.96s)]
*  and a bunch of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=123.36s)]
*  They said to keep government open, but a lot of Democratic House members, including yourself, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=126.44s)]
*  were very upset that they joined with the Republicans. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=130.92s)]
*  Is the Democratic Party up for this moment? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=134.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=138.24s)]
*  This is a very dark moment in American history. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=140.04000000000002s)]
*  Is your party up for it? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think part of the thing and, you know, we don't have a leader, that one person that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=143.4s)]
*  can speak for the party. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=151.8s)]
*  You have it when you had a president. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=152.96s)]
*  We were spoiled with that for four years or a vice president. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=154.28s)]
*  But right now, you know, is it Hakeem Jeffries? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  Is it Chuck Schumer? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  Is it a governor? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=162.28s)]
*  Is it Cory Booker? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=163.56s)]
*  Is it Bernie Sanders or AOC? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=165.4s)]
*  Is it any of us who are going around the country doing town halls in Republican districts? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=168.44s)]
*  Or is it kind of all of us? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=172.64s)]
*  And, you know, there is, it is a bit difficult to have that one person speaking for the Democratic [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=174.84s)]
*  Party. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=180.48s)]
*  And because of that, I think it looks sloppier than it should. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=181.48s)]
*  All I know is that moment in the Senate, people want us to fight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=184.8s)]
*  People are pissed. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=188.68s)]
*  They're concerned. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=189.68s)]
*  They're nervous. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=190.68s)]
*  I am pissed and I am concerned and I am nervous. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=191.68s)]
*  And they want to know that we share the exact same feelings they have. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=194.04s)]
*  They want us to fight. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=197.88s)]
*  And if we're not doing that, we're really not rising to the moment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=199.2s)]
*  So it you know, part of our problem is we just don't have a singular point person. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=202.88s)]
*  And because of it, you know, it can look more chaotic than I actually think it is. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=207.92s)]
*  I mean, the singular point person in the Senate is Chuck Schumer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=212.64s)]
*  Do you think he's the right person to be leading the Democrats in the Senate right now? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=216.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's for the Senate to figure out. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=219.07999999999998s)]
*  I was really glad that Cory Booker did what he did last week. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=220.92s)]
*  And I hope other senators realize that any of us should just go ahead and do things. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I didn't wait and ask for permission to go into neighboring Republican districts [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=228.24s)]
*  and new town halls. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=231.76s)]
*  And yet because of it, now I've got 20 or 30 members doing the exact same thing, which [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=233.12s)]
*  is where we should do take the fight right to them where they're unwilling to talk to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=237.36s)]
*  their constituents. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=241.16s)]
*  I just think it's on all of us to do this right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=242.16s)]
*  So again, I thought Cory Booker did something that was really needed to show that there [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=246.08s)]
*  was a fight in the Senate. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=250.44s)]
*  And I think, you know, watching Bernie Sanders go around the country, watching all the members [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=251.8s)]
*  go into other districts. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=256.12s)]
*  This is what we need to do. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=257.68s)]
*  On that note, you have Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joining Senator Bernie Sanders [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=258.68s)]
*  for this Fight the Oligarchy Tour, where the two of them have been drawing massive crowds, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=262.8s)]
*  crowds even bigger than the ones in Senator Sanders' presidential campaign rallies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=268.16s)]
*  People are now speculating whether AOC is being primed to become the new Bernie, someone [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=272.6s)]
*  who can connect with the working class, can lead rallies, has energy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  Is that someone you think the party should be rallying around, an AOC type figure? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=282.3s)]

*  Yeah, well, I think a lot of people who are out speaking out are doing that right now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=303.0s)]
*  AOC is a great communicator, I think actually one of the best within the party. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=307.0s)]
*  And I'm glad she's doing what she's doing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=311.0s)]
*  But you know, every member that goes into a swing Republican district is doing the work [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=313.44s)]
*  we need to right now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=319.12s)]
*  I mean, those big rallies get the national attention. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=320.32s)]
*  But honestly, going into a district where someone won, if you won by less than 10 points [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=322.68s)]
*  after Wisconsin's election on Tuesday, you got to decide one of two things. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=327.28s)]
*  Either one, you're going to start figuring out a way to listen to your constituents instead [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=331.44s)]
*  of hiding in your basement, not doing town halls. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=334.88s)]
*  Or two, you're going to get a discount card at Costco so you can buy Depends by the Carton. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=337.04s)]
*  Because it's one or two options you got. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=342.22s)]
*  And you know, I think just any push that we do right now that exposes the Republican hypocrisy [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=344.3s)]
*  for not standing up to Donald Trump and Elon Musk is what's necessary. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=350.62s)]
*  And those big rallies help in getting some press. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  But I think the ones, you know, when I go to a community of 4500 people like Viroqua, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=358.3s)]
*  Wisconsin and the third congressional district, and three to 400 people show up out of that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=362.78000000000003s)]
*  town, that's sending a message, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=366.82000000000005s)]
*  That's saying that they're upset their member of Congress isn't listening to them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=369.58s)]
*  And that's what the Wisconsin election was. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  People aren't listening to them. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=375.3s)]
*  So they came out in record numbers, almost at mid-level congressional election numbers [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=376.62s)]
*  for a nonpartisan April primary. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=382.18s)]
*  That's saying something. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=384.78s)]
*  The people are leading. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=385.78s)]
*  Now we just need the leaders to follow. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=386.78s)]
*  And you mentioned the Wisconsin race. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=389.06s)]
*  It's your state. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=390.7s)]
*  Let's talk about some good news there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=391.7s)]
*  Elon Musk spent over $20 million in your state in that Wisconsin Supreme Court, state Supreme [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=393.18s)]
*  Court race. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=398.21999999999997s)]
*  And the conservative candidate lost by double digits. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=400.26s)]
*  What happened in Wisconsin, Congressman? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=402.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=404.7s)]
*  So I mean, I think the bigger message than even the win, which was a big win by 10 points [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=405.7s)]
*  in a purple state, was the turnout. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  You know, the fact that we were saying if we could just get to the turnout when we first [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=412.74s)]
*  took the court two years ago and Janet Prosewicz won, how much better we would do because we [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=417.18s)]
*  knew the numbers were good. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=421.62s)]
*  We surpassed those numbers. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=422.62s)]
*  And I think that surprised a lot of us with people just wanting to be heard. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  And this was their vehicle. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=429.86s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk, you know, he's the perfect villain. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=430.86s)]
*  If he would just walk around with a pinky in his mouth the whole time, you know, he's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=432.7s)]
*  got the Dr. Evil thing going down really well. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=436.38s)]
*  People don't like him and didn't like him trying to buy an election and outsider coming [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=439.38s)]
*  into Wisconsin like that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=444.03999999999996s)]
*  Then he was giving away the million dollar checks and all the rest. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=445.46s)]
*  That certainly didn't help. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=448.9s)]
*  But at the end of the day, this was people saying, I don't like what's going on right [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=450.5s)]
*  now with the Trump-Musk agenda. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=454.64s)]
*  And my only way to express that is to get out and vote on this April normally sleepy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=456.74s)]
*  election and vote for, you know, a Supreme Court race and a state superintendent of schools [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=462.06s)]
*  race that if they were probably in the line next to them at a grocery store, they may [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=467.42s)]
*  not know who they are standing next to. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=472.38s)]
*  But this was a resounding voice out against the Donald Trump and Musk agenda. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=474.14s)]
*  And there was some more positive news for small D democracy over the weekend. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=480.82s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people took to the streets across the nation telling Elon Musk to get [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=484.3s)]
*  his hands off the government. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=487.94s)]
*  In many cases, also pushing back against the ongoing genocide in Gaza. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=490.02000000000004s)]
*  Can Democrats ride this popular wave? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=493.82s)]
*  Or do Democrats, elected Democrats, the party apparatus, does it need to get out of the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=497.66s)]
*  way and leave this organic? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=502.1s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=503.66s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of this is organic. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=504.66s)]
*  You know, I mean, I know it's a bumper sticker I used to have for my campaign, but I believe [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=506.66s)]
*  it if the people lead, eventually the leaders will follow. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=510.46000000000004s)]
*  The people are leading. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=513.38s)]
*  We saw that in election results in Florida and Wisconsin. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=514.38s)]
*  We're seeing that at these rallies across the country. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=517.34s)]
*  So let's actually harness that energy because the one thing we can do is help provide a [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=519.98s)]
*  more organized way to have it focused. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=525.14s)]
*  And right now, you know, my biggest goal is to stop the cuts in order to do this tax cut [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=527.98s)]
*  for the wealthiest. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=532.72s)]
*  I don't want to see health care and long term care through Medicaid cut. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=533.72s)]
*  I don't want to see food assistance, the number one program, keeping kids out of poverty [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=536.5s)]
*  cut. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=540.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to see education funding cut. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=541.3000000000001s)]
*  And in order to do that, we've got to take all those voices but give them the most guided [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=542.82s)]
*  way of using that energy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=549.74s)]
*  So I do think there's a symbiotic relationship. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=551.62s)]
*  The Democratic Party has to work with the masses, but the masses are there and we'd [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  be wise to catch up and figure out how to work with them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=558.22s)]
*  Given that this is a moment where billionaires are being seen as Dr. Evil type villains, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=561.46s)]
*  they're not just making tons of money and paying little tax. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=567.46s)]
*  They're also basically decimating the government, not just Elon Musk directly, but indirectly [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=569.96s)]
*  the likes of the Bill Ackmans and the Chamaths and others kind of egging him on. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=574.12s)]
*  They're not very popular figures. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=578.6s)]
*  So given that, was it wise for your leader in the House, Hakeem Jeffries, to go to Silicon [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=579.76s)]
*  Valley, as was widely reported, and reassure rich IT folks in Silicon Valley, hey, Democrats [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=585.2800000000001s)]
*  are still on your side. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=590.4000000000001s)]
*  Don't ditch us. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=591.4000000000001s)]
*  Look, the Democrats' first bill every time we're in charge is H.R.1, the most comprehensive [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=592.4000000000001s)]
*  campaign finance, election and ethics reform law. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=598.18s)]
*  Until we change things like Citizens United, unfortunately, you've got people who are in [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=600.8399999999999s)]
*  elected leadership have to go around the country and raise money and it's an awful system. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=606.18s)]
*  We just saw Elon Musk dumping that kind of money into a state like Wisconsin, but we [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=610.38s)]
*  should take these billionaires head on. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=615.38s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk, this is corruption to a degree we have not seen. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=618.26s)]
*  This guy is turning on and off the federal spigots of funding, but he's getting federal [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=622.78s)]
*  contracts. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=626.98s)]
*  I can't have a federal contract as a member of Congress. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=627.98s)]
*  A federal employee can't have a federal contract related to anything they have. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=630.26s)]
*  And he's getting $8 million a day in federal contracts while the average person on Social [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=634.5s)]
*  Security is getting $65 a day. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=638.94s)]
*  And he's going to get even more with that the C.R. that just passed. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=641.34s)]
*  They have ability to break some contracts. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=645.26s)]
*  So we have to focus on this billionaire class. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=646.94s)]
*  And that's why I think, you know, having the oligarchy tour that you're having right now [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=649.74s)]
*  with Bernie Sanders and AOC is useful. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=653.7s)]
*  And I think this is a moment where people are starting to get in. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=656.5s)]
*  This may help us in the long run on campaign finance reform as well. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=659.98s)]
*  One of the groups that Bernie Sanders has called out during his tour is APAC, which [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=664.1s)]
*  is a pro-Israel lobby group that spends a lot of money on elections, helped unseat two [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=668.78s)]
*  of your progressive colleagues, Cory Bush and Jamal Bowman in the last race in the last [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=673.82s)]
*  elections. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=679.02s)]
*  Can Democrats get away from APAC's influence and dollars? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=680.26s)]
*  There's a new poll out, Congressman, that shows the vast majority of the Democratic [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=684.18s)]
*  base believe Israel's actions in Gaza constitute either genocide or war crimes or both. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=688.18s)]
*  That is not the view of the majority of your colleagues, Democratic colleagues in the House. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=694.9s)]
*  Is there a disconnect between elected Democrats and the Democratic base? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=699.5s)]
*  And is APAC partly responsible for that? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=703.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, APAC is one of probably two groups that's doing a very unfortunately effective [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=706.02s)]
*  job in taking big money and bringing it to primaries where you can buy elections for [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=712.5s)]
*  less. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=717.1s)]
*  And it's really distorting the process. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=718.1s)]
*  They tried in my district, they called a mayor in my district, asked the person if I could [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=720.38s)]
*  be beat, they said no. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=724.58s)]
*  They asked if they had run against me, they said no, and then they called me up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=725.96s)]
*  So I'm ready for whatever's going to happen because this is the way they operate. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=729.18s)]
*  But it's them and quite honestly, some crypto money that it's just big dollars coming into [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=733.22s)]
*  primaries. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=737.78s)]
*  When you can spend $4 million, for example, in Michigan against an Andy Levin, someone [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=738.86s)]
*  who is himself Jewish but has values and believes in human rights, that just shows in a general [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=743.54s)]
*  election, it could be 20 million. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=750.98s)]
*  But in a primary, you can start to buy these pretty cheaply. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=753.02s)]
*  We need to stand up against that outside money. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=756.26s)]
*  And since we can't do it legislatively right now because Republicans are in charge, we [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=759.52s)]
*  need to make their money toxic. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=763.6999999999999s)]
*  And if you're getting money from them, you should maybe consider voting against the folks [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=765.46s)]
*  that are taking this big money in these races. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=769.7800000000001s)]
*  And I think we all need to work together to make sure that they don't just come in and [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=772.62s)]
*  buy elections. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=776.46s)]
*  Buy elections and buy policy in the sense that the American government is doing some [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=778.0s)]
*  crazy shit on its behalf. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  Bassem Youssef, Zatariya contributor, said in a recent podcast of ours that he moved [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=783.6600000000001s)]
*  to this country because he lived in Egypt where he couldn't criticize his own government. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=788.82s)]
*  And now he moves to the US, he's being told he can't criticize a foreign government. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  We have this insane situation where students, green card holders, H1B visa holders are being [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=796.62s)]
*  deported not because they criticize the American government but because they criticize the [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=803.62s)]
*  Israeli government or because they're opposed to what Israel is doing. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=807.46s)]
*  That is an insane situation, is it not? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=811.26s)]
*  Shouldn't Democrats be doing more to call out not just the actual deportations but the [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=813.1s)]
*  logic behind them that you shouldn't be able to criticize Israel? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=818.14s)]
*  The IHRA definition of anti-Semitism now means that you can't say that Israel was [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=821.54s)]
*  a racist endeavor. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=825.38s)]
*  Bassem Yeah, no, we've got more and more people actually doing that, which is good, right? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=826.38s)]
*  And that's part of what we need right now at this moment. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=830.5799999999999s)]
*  I had a Republican on the floor say to me, I hope you guys are going to do something [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=832.86s)]
*  about that woman at Tufts who has taken away. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=836.62s)]
*  I'm like, we're doing something, why don't you do something? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=839.18s)]
*  You're the voice that we actually need to stand up. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=841.8399999999999s)]
*  And they're just afraid, unfortunately, of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  But for us, we do need to make sure that we're speaking out against this. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=849.38s)]
*  And I noticed the letters that we're now doing around this are getting more and more members [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=852.9399999999999s)]
*  and that's a positive thing. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=856.78s)]
*  So we just need the Republicans, someone to channel their inner, I never thought I'd say [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=858.62s)]
*  this, but Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger to, you know, try to do something right. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=864.14s)]
*  Right now, we just don't have that in the Republican Party in the House of Representatives anyway. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=868.86s)]
*  Congressman Mark Pogum, we'll have to leave it there. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=872.9s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=875.58s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=877.1800000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwAtfo_cSZU&t=878.5400000000001s)]
