# "An absolute sh*t show for Democrats": Two DC insiders debate whether Biden should step down
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4)
*  Will Joe Biden still be the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee by the time you watch this segment? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=0.0s)]
*  Probably. He's said very clearly, defiantly even, that he isn't standing down until he gets a call from God himself. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=5.32s)]
*  A kind of Trumpy thing to say, if you ask me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=11.68s)]
*  And yet every day that goes by, we're seeing the polls get worse and worse for the president, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=14.0s)]
*  we're seeing the media in a frenzy, and we're seeing more and more Democrats come out and say, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=18.04s)]
*  we don't think he's the right guy to take on Trump. He's too far behind, he's too old, he's not the guy he once was. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  This week we saw former Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing her doubts in the president, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=28.44s)]
*  as well as the first sitting Democratic senator to call for him to step aside. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=32.4s)]
*  Plus the Lieutenant Governor of New York did it too, as did George Clooney, a friend of the president's and a top fundraiser for him, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=35.92s)]
*  who said the Biden he was with just three weeks ago was not the same Biden of 2020, let alone 2010. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=42.32s)]
*  The president's critics say his age is an undeniable problem, his mental health is a clear vulnerability, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  and his inability to communicate clearly in public is a huge gift to the Republican Party. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=54.04s)]
*  His supporters say it's too late in the game to change candidates, that Biden won the Democratic primaries fair and square, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=59.16s)]
*  and of course he won the 2020 election against Trump, and that his CNN debate performance was just one bad night. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=64.92s)]
*  So what should the Democratic Party do? Try and force Joe to stand aside or not? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=72.0s)]
*  To debate this, to discuss this, I'm joined today in the studio by two guests who are in my view, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=77.64s)]
*  two of the smartest, savviest, wisest voices in Washington DC, two men who I've been a fan of for a while. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=82.12s)]
*  Norm Ornstein is a political scientist, bestselling author, emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=88.12s)]
*  and contributing editor at the Atlantic. He referred to immediate calls for Biden to drop out after the debate as foolish, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=92.92s)]
*  and has been very critical of the media frenzy around the president's age. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=98.68s)]
*  Making the case for Biden stepping aside for a new candidate right now is political journalist Brian Boitler, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=102.12s)]
*  co-host of the weekly podcast, Politics, formerly of Crooked Media in the New Republic, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  and now author of the Off-Message Substack Newsletter. Thank you both for joining me on Mayor the Unfiltered. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=110.68s)]
*  Brian, kick us off briefly. Make your case for why in this moment, at this late stage, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=116.68s)]
*  weeks out from the Democratic convention, months out from the election, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=122.68s)]
*  the Democratic Party should ask their candidate, their presumptive nominee, to step aside. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=126.44000000000001s)]
*  So I want to toggle the words you used, because you said force. Should Democrats force Joe Biden out? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  And I think what really has to happen is they need to persuade him that he is now what you could call the below replacement level candidate for president, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=135.64s)]
*  that the other Democrats in that top tier of American politics would be better candidates than he is, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=143.48s)]
*  because due to his age, he's no longer able to communicate clearly in public. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=150.76s)]
*  And I think that that takes the deft touch of somebody like Nancy Pelosi, who, other than God himself, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=154.76s)]
*  I think is very good at getting fellow Democrats to see what's in their best interest and in the best interest of the party. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=160.6s)]
*  And less like what senators like Mark Warner have done, which is to announce that they're going to march to the White House and read the President the Riot Act and make him step down. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=166.76s)]
*  If Biden does this on his own, then I think you have you don't run into any legitimacy problems. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=175.32s)]
*  You don't run into any of you can circumvent the critique that his supporters are making that the Democratic primary base already decided this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=181.48s)]
*  And then he can pass the torch to another candidate who can process. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  That's a process issue. Why should he step aside? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=193.0s)]
*  Because he can't communicate extemporaneously in public clearly anymore. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=195.32s)]
*  Norm, do you agree with any of that? Some of that? All of that? None of that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=199.72s)]
*  You know, I'm of two minds. I have to say about this. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=202.36s)]
*  I will say just to start, maybe that there was not a Trumpy thing that Biden said. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  Trump would have said both Corinthians have to convince me. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  That aside, let me just address the communications part. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=214.12s)]
*  This was a tweet from yesterday. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=217.16s)]
*  I'm a speech pathologist with pictures of Biden at the debate. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=220.04s)]
*  What you see here is not dementia. It is stuttering. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=223.8s)]
*  The extended eye blinks are called secondary behaviors. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=226.76s)]
*  Notice every time he does that, he is disfluent, which means he can't communicate well at the end when he doesn't finish his thought and diverts to look. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=229.96s)]
*  It's called circumlocution. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=237.8s)]
*  So what I have to say puzzled me greatly about the immediate aftermath of the debate was if Biden wanted to move this past what is now, if you'll pardon the expression, an absolute shit show for Democrats with a press corps that has gone into a frenzy about it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=240.04s)]
*  He should have on that Sunday gone on 60 minutes with Leslie Stahl and done a full hour. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=260.92s)]
*  The White House should have re-released with great fanfare his physical results, which they put out in February on Whitehouse.gov, which I will guarantee you 90% of the White House press corps never looked at, but which said a pathologist, a neurologist had given him the full workup. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=267.64s)]
*  There were no signs of Parkinson's or other neurological diseases and address directly the concerns that people have. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=287.96s)]
*  He's old, certainly. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=297.96s)]
*  The other part of this was he's got neuropathy in his feet, some of which came from breaking his foot a while back. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=299.4s)]
*  The shuffling on stage, the leaning forward, there are physical explanations for that. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=305.76s)]
*  He can govern. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=311.4s)]
*  Now, having said that, the longer this goes on, the worse it is not just for Democrats, but for the country. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  The Washington Post has put 35 reporters. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  This is a staff that has already been reduced by layoffs and buyouts on this case. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=325.88s)]
*  What did they do with Watergate? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=334.2s)]
*  Two reporters. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=336.79999999999995s)]
*  They were great ones, Woodward and Bernstein. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=337.96s)]
*  This is whenever there is a death watch, will he stay? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=340.56s)]
*  Will he go? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=344.32s)]
*  It's rabid dogs in a frenzy. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=345.56s)]
*  And it's the Times, the Post, the AP and everybody else. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=348.92s)]
*  It's television news. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=352.04s)]
*  I agree with you on the frenzy, but surely you don't agree with this line of argument that some Biden supporters put forward, that this is a media creation, because we all saw with our eyes that debate. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  We all saw the Stephanopoulos interview. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=362.12s)]
*  This is not a media creation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=364.32s)]
*  It's absolutely real. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=365.8s)]
*  It needs to be covered. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  There are serious questions about this president for four more years. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=368.92s)]
*  There is no doubt as we look at some of the in-depth stories that there has been an aging process, a significant one. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=374.12s)]
*  And if you look ahead to 83, 84, 85, it's a real issue. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  But with all of this, we have twice as many, three times as many stories about Biden in the Times and the Post. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=387.0s)]
*  And they're the opinion leaders for all the rest of journalism. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=395.56s)]
*  Almost nothing on Trump, who in the last 10 days has shown not just that we have to be scared to death about what kind of a hellscape he would provide, but shown signs over and over again of his own cognitive decline completely ignored. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  He thinks his son Don Jr. got married, but who hasn't got married? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=411.96s)]
*  If Biden says that, that would be a 24-7 story. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=414.44s)]
*  Brian, you've said before that Biden should overcome his troubling RBG-like stubbornness, referring to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice, and choose to suspend his campaign. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you think... [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=426.6s)]
*  Twofold question there. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=427.68s)]
*  A, do you think his chances of winning are now beyond saving? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=428.8s)]
*  And B, why do you think he's so stubborn on this? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=431.48s)]
*  Well, I think that he's walking the stages of grief about his own political death, which is, you know, he's a human. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=434.6s)]
*  And it's a very tall order to get somebody under any circumstances to own up to the reality that they can't do the things that they want to do. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=439.88s)]
*  And in his case, he won the election. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=447.32s)]
*  He was looking OK for reelection before the debate. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=449.08s)]
*  You know, there was a real path for him. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  And now it's not that anyone can say with certainty that he can't win the election. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=456.6s)]
*  But what we can say with certainty is that the plan that the campaign put in place to get him into a lead right now has not worked. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=461.0s)]
*  And they don't appear to have another good idea about how to get him both above Trump and then growing a lead big enough to overcome any electoral college disadvantage that he may have. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=467.12s)]
*  And if any plan that they had entailed him being able to aggressively rebut lies that Donald Trump tells about him or defend his own record or make the case for the future in non-stripted environments, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=477.96s)]
*  then it becomes really hard to see how you can trust them when they say they have this all in hand. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that an alternate is destined to win either. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=496.96s)]
*  They might enter the race and find themselves trailing in the polls a little bit, just like Joe Biden is. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=499.71999999999997s)]
*  But we would have faith that they could parry with Donald Trump and with the rest of the Republican Party, that when good jobs numbers came out like they did this morning or I'm sorry, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=505.44s)]
*  good inflation data came out like it did this morning, that they would be able to go to the mics without preparation and take questions from reporters and brag about the progress that they've made and how much things how much worse things would be under Donald Trump. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=513.16s)]
*  And that's why I think Democrats in Congress and who are running for office right now are coming around to the view that it's a safer bet to it would be a safer bet if Joe Biden would accept the reality of his condition of what he's capable of right now and let somebody else take the torch. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=524.9599999999999s)]
*  Norm, you've been following President Actuals for years. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=543.16s)]
*  You're a very young man. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=545.76s)]
*  But you've been following it for years. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=546.76s)]
*  Surely it's indisputable, Brian is saying, you need a presidential candidate, especially one who's trailing to prosecute the case against a Donald Trump menace. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=548.92s)]
*  Biden wasn't able to do that in the debate. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=556.92s)]
*  I get nervous just thinking about a second debate between these two men. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=559.4s)]
*  Over the next four months, wouldn't it be better to have a candidate, whether it's Kamala Harris, probably or someone else, to prosecute the case against Trump that Biden has showed he's unable to do? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=562.8399999999999s)]
*  So I do following on what Brian said, I think a good part of the reason that Biden has dug in on this is he has been a transformational president. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=571.6s)]
*  If the three of us had been sitting at his inaugural on January 20th, 2021 and said, OK, here's a guy coming in with a Congress that is going to be an enormous challenge to him. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  Both houses extremely close, one with basically no margin of error. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=595.36s)]
*  And in three years, we're going to get three to four trillion dollars in safety net relief infrastructure. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=602.48s)]
*  We're going to get the chipset protecting us. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=608.24s)]
*  We're going to have better manufacturing than we have seen. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=610.24s)]
*  We're going to have an economy that most people predicted would end up in recession or with hyperinflation, with, as Brian said, inflation actually coming down and robust growth and, Mark, all of that. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=613.0s)]
*  And I've worked with our allies. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=624.56s)]
*  We've stabilized the alliance, all of that. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=627.28s)]
*  I want to finish the job. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=630.16s)]
*  I can really understand that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=632.0s)]
*  But this point is very well taken. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=634.04s)]
*  There are two ways in which this election is framed. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=637.88s)]
*  One is it's about Biden, his policies and his ability to govern. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=640.28s)]
*  And a lot of people don't like where we are. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=645.72s)]
*  They think inflation has been really hurting them. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=648.68s)]
*  Interest rates hurting them. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=651.68s)]
*  They don't understand or recognize what he's done. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=653.96s)]
*  And now we've got this set of issues about age and competence. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=656.4399999999999s)]
*  He loses. No question. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=661.48s)]
*  The second is, is this about integrity, decency, democracy? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=663.88s)]
*  And if that's the frame of the election, Joe Biden wins, even with these third party candidates who will chip away at him. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=671.56s)]
*  However, and he's, I'm sure, looking back. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=678.56s)]
*  But you mentioned democracy. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=680.56s)]
*  We all agree, I think, around this table, I think, in the White House. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  It's existential. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=685.24s)]
*  Although there's now reporting coming out that some Democrats in private say we don't think it's existential. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=686.24s)]
*  But let's part that for a moment. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=689.92s)]
*  How did you feel about Biden telling George Stephanopoulos that if he loses to Trump, quote, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  I'll feel as long as I gave it my all, that's what this is about. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=695.64s)]
*  That's not what this is about. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=698.88s)]
*  What an insane thing to say. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=700.0799999999999s)]
*  And I saw a very powerful tweet that said, after I lose my job, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=701.4s)]
*  after I find out that my marriage is invalid and they take away my IVF and ability to have any children, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=710.52s)]
*  I will say, gee, it's so nice that you think you gave your all. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=721.04s)]
*  That was for our friend E.J. Dionne, who didn't want to take this position. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=725.72s)]
*  That was a major straw. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=731.88s)]
*  And it feels like you're reluctantly coming to this position as someone who's... [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=733.44s)]
*  Well, you know, I think that that response was bad. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=735.8000000000001s)]
*  We're going to see what happens a little bit further down the road. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=738.4s)]
*  Having said all of that, remember, and Ron Klain did an interview with Greg Sargent at the New Republic, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=740.88s)]
*  acknowledging Biden's difficult political position, saying that there's a path ahead. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=747.16s)]
*  I remember when John Kerry was 18 points up in 2004 and lost. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=751.72s)]
*  There's a path there. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=759.28s)]
*  We do not know because we're not there yet. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=760.6s)]
*  When we have another candidate, what happens? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=763.84s)]
*  It'll have to be Kamala Harris. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=766.2s)]
*  They have no time to find something else and to have a convention that would have journalists [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=769.0400000000001s)]
*  and others drooling that goes to multiple ballots. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  But we don't know. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=776.0400000000001s)]
*  The guns will be out for her. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=777.48s)]
*  It's not clear. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=779.2800000000001s)]
*  Having said that, there's no doubt that somebody else is going to be able to prosecute the case [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=780.48s)]
*  against Trump a little bit better. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=784.96s)]
*  Before we come to Kamala Harris, Brian, why are Democrats busily briefing reporters in private [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=786.44s)]
*  that they don't think Joe Biden can win and then publicly saying they back him, he's the candidate? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=792.76s)]
*  Has the Democratic Party under Biden turned into the Republican Party under Trump? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=797.28s)]
*  I think that there's some complicating factors that distinguish how Democrats are acting [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=801.16s)]
*  under Biden from how Republicans would be acting tables turned under Donald Trump. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=805.52s)]
*  Republicans would say that if Donald Trump gave the debate performance that Joe Biden [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=809.76s)]
*  gave, that it was the best debate performance they ever seen, that he won the debate hands [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=813.64s)]
*  down and there wouldn't have been a feeding frenzy to get him out of the race on account [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=816.96s)]
*  of cognitive issues because they would have just denied that anything was amiss. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  I think two things. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  One is that Democrats are very uncertain. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  They're very data driven. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=828.8199999999999s)]
*  They want to see what focus groups and poll results say before they come to any conclusion [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=830.5s)]
*  about what the best path forward is. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=835.8s)]
*  And so we've been waiting these past two weeks essentially for the picture to become clear [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=837.7199999999999s)]
*  enough for them to know what to say. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=840.8399999999999s)]
*  And then complicating matters further is there was a NATO summit in Washington, D.C. this [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  week and many Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, I believe openly, said, let's let the president [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=847.8s)]
*  get through this. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=854.8s)]
*  We shouldn't have the president announce that he's a lame duck before the allies get here [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=855.8s)]
*  and he's trying to hold them together. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=861.04s)]
*  They need to have some pretense under which he's, you know, he's in the presidency running [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=862.4799999999999s)]
*  for reelection and what he says you can take to the bank. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=869.16s)]
*  It's interesting you mentioned lame duck. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=872.16s)]
*  If he stands down as candidate, if he decides to change his mind, right now there's no indications [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=874.52s)]
*  that he wants to change his mind. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=878.1999999999999s)]
*  Does he have to stand down as president as well? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  And does it have to be Kamala Harris, both obviously legally, constitutionally, she has [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=881.36s)]
*  to take over the presidency. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=884.84s)]
*  But does she have to be the nominee or is there a path for anyone else? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=886.24s)]
*  So I think that those are two different questions. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=888.64s)]
*  So the whether Joe Biden should not be president anymore, I think, is a question that's ultimately [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=890.76s)]
*  medical. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=896.44s)]
*  And yes, he was assessed, what, six months ago, but he is 81. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=897.44s)]
*  And I do think it would be valuable to know if the diagnosis still stands back in February [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=902.36s)]
*  is still accurate. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=906.96s)]
*  If it's really just that he's lost his extemporaneous speaking capacity, then I don't think that [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=909.4s)]
*  there's any reason he couldn't serve out his term. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=914.4399999999999s)]
*  If he weren't, if we were to find out that he had Parkinson's disease or any other debilitating [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  condition that called into question his ability to be president, obviously, Kamala Harris [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=921.36s)]
*  would become president. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=924.76s)]
*  But I think that the at least as far as the rules and laws are concerned, the question [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=925.88s)]
*  of who would succeed him on a ticket remains technically open. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=930.56s)]
*  That being said, that under any any circumstance under which Biden isn't running for president, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=934.3s)]
*  I agree with Norm, it's almost certainly going to be Kamala Harris who takes his place, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=939.08s)]
*  even though in theory, there could be a contested convention and a completely new ticket could [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=943.2s)]
*  emerge that way. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=947.96s)]
*  No, I'm sure with that. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=948.96s)]
*  So, you know, the problem with the lame duck president generally is that you have a party [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=949.96s)]
*  deeply divided. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=953.36s)]
*  Everybody's got knives out for everybody else. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=955.0s)]
*  And that's not the case now that you can't get anything done in Congress because they'll [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=958.5600000000001s)]
*  wait for the next person. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=962.32s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen otherwise. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=964.0s)]
*  He is, I think, fully capable of finishing on his term. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=966.84s)]
*  And one other point, which is I do not want Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, next [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=969.5600000000001s)]
*  in line for the presidency with Kamala Harris there. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=974.5600000000001s)]
*  It will be Kamala Harris if there is an alternative because they can't afford to have anything [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=978.44s)]
*  else going on with a nomination process that will extend into the fall and will again completely [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=985.08s)]
*  away from the reality of this existential threat to our fundamental way of life. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=993.12s)]
*  And on that existential threat, it's funny because, Norm, you spend a lot of time online, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=997.64s)]
*  as do I. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1001.2s)]
*  You and I first met on Twitter. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1002.2s)]
*  We all spend a lot of time, too much time online. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1004.72s)]
*  And what I'm seeing from Biden supporters online, I know it's not reflective of the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1007.04s)]
*  country as a whole, but it is very mag-esque. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1010.72s)]
*  There is a kind of denial of reality. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1013.6s)]
*  If you say the polls, they say they don't believe the polls. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1015.4s)]
*  They don't believe that CNN and ABC didn't screw over Biden in some conspiratorial way. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1017.6s)]
*  What is going on with that faction of the Democratic Party that's just absolutely in [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1024.2s)]
*  denial about the bad state that we're in? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1028.32s)]
*  And the fact that those of us who are saying that Biden should step aside, we're not saying [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1031.16s)]
*  it because we want Trump to win. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1034.72s)]
*  The very opposite. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1035.84s)]
*  It's because we're absolutely petrified Trump's going to win if he stays in place. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1036.84s)]
*  Absolutely true. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1041.2s)]
*  I'll just follow what Brian said, that I also have called publicly for getting a group of [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1043.2s)]
*  world-class neurologists to do a full workup now. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1048.2s)]
*  And if it shows, and if Biden team are confident that there is no neurological issue here, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  that ought to put that to rest. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1059.2s)]
*  Well, it puts his governing ability to rest. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1060.44s)]
*  It doesn't put his candidacy to rest. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1062.52s)]
*  No, but it puts the questions about whether he is deteriorating in a way that would make [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1064.0800000000002s)]
*  it impossible for him to govern out of the picture at least, or for many it would. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1069.9199999999998s)]
*  I do think there are people in denial. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1076.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1078.56s)]
*  There is some of that fury about others challenging him. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1079.6s)]
*  We know that there's a real difference with people of color, especially the black community [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1086.32s)]
*  that are more behind Biden. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1091.48s)]
*  Interestingly, when the alternative is a woman of color, but it's a belief that he's really [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1093.1999999999998s)]
*  done good stuff for them. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1097.24s)]
*  The black caucus immediately basically got behind him full square. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1099.44s)]
*  A lot of the others, AOC, supporting him. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1103.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's true in the public as well. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1108.96s)]
*  Hispanic voters, more supportive than white Democrats right now. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1111.0800000000002s)]
*  Although a big chunk of black voters also saying Biden should step aside. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1115.8000000000002s)]
*  But let's go back to what you said about the Republicans and the Democrats. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1119.0s)]
*  We have a party that has always been a boisterous party. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1124.64s)]
*  Even though many people are saying privately different things than they're saying publicly, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1128.84s)]
*  we got a whole lot of people saying it publicly. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1132.76s)]
*  Remember Will Rogers said decades ago, I'm not a member of any organized political party, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1135.72s)]
*  I'm a Democrat. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1139.84s)]
*  The Republicans are a cult. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1141.6s)]
*  No matter what Donald Trump did or said, they wouldn't abandon him. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1144.0s)]
*  And I watched the Pravda-like papers, the Washington Examiner, the Fox News after the [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  debate, a cool, calm performance by Donald Trump. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1156.2s)]
*  The lies nowhere to be found. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1159.8s)]
*  But what's annoying is even that's on Biden because it was Biden that took away from Trump. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1162.28s)]
*  I mean Trump said insane things that night. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1166.52s)]
*  He was asked about climate change and he said we had H2O, meaningless statement. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1168.24s)]
*  In any other context that would be a big story. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1172.6000000000001s)]
*  But because Joe Biden was saying we beat Medicare, it didn't really make the headlines. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1174.44s)]
*  Brian, before we wrap up, I've got to ask you about what a lot of more serious Biden [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1178.64s)]
*  defenders are saying, which is it's a leap into the unknown. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1182.96s)]
*  We get it, there's issues right now, the polling's not great, but what about the other side? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1187.04s)]
*  And they point to, for example, 1968 where you have LBJ stepping aside, Hubert Humphrey, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1192.08s)]
*  his vice president coming in and losing to Nixon. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1196.92s)]
*  Not many data points from history to compare to, but they point to that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1200.32s)]
*  How would you respond to that line of argument? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1203.32s)]
*  So I've seen the 1968 comparison several times since this conversation came to light a couple [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1204.96s)]
*  weeks ago. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1209.72s)]
*  And I think what people forget is that that was a very tumultuous time and Hubert Humphrey [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1210.92s)]
*  came very close to winning that election. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1215.44s)]
*  And that LBJ, I think, made the calculated decision that he definitely would have lost. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1218.8400000000001s)]
*  So I don't think that it necessarily suggests that the error was LBJ's, that he would have [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1223.68s)]
*  won if he had stayed in that race. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1230.24s)]
*  But if you look more recently to countries where leadership swaps at the top of a party [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1232.66s)]
*  are much more common and can happen much more quickly. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1238.24s)]
*  We've seen recently over the last five, six years a few times where an unpopular head [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1240.88s)]
*  of a party voluntarily steps down, is replaced, or is even defrocked by a more popular leader, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1244.88s)]
*  and their party just in general gains a bump. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1252.68s)]
*  And it's not just Kamala Harris is one point better than Biden, and so Democrats in general [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1255.7s)]
*  will pull one point better if she takes over the party. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1260.52s)]
*  The fact that the party is responding to public concerns can generate an extra boost for the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1263.64s)]
*  new leader. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1269.88s)]
*  And the honeymoon. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1270.88s)]
*  And look, that's speculative too. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1271.88s)]
*  The rollout could go terribly and she could end up polling worse. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1274.0400000000002s)]
*  But it's not just that Biden entered the debate tied at best, probably a little bit behind [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1277.68s)]
*  and is now further behind. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1282.5200000000002s)]
*  I think you have to reflect on the last three years and what public opinion says about how [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1284.0s)]
*  voters conceive of Biden and Trump. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1290.84s)]
*  You have to rethink it in light of what we saw on Thursday. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1293.6799999999998s)]
*  Joe Biden has had this very successful presidency on the merits. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1296.32s)]
*  But if you ask voters, they think the economy is terrible. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1299.98s)]
*  They have decided that Donald Trump was a much better president than they remember. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1303.28s)]
*  He's been able to, Donald Trump has been able to rehabilitate himself in the public imagination. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1307.6399999999999s)]
*  And I think you can't anymore say that that's just because of Republican propaganda on its [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1312.1999999999998s)]
*  own. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1318.48s)]
*  It's that we've had an ineffective communicator running the Democratic Party the whole time. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1319.48s)]
*  And we don't know how much better things would look for the Democratic Party right now if [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1326.1200000000001s)]
*  all along the president was vigorous and able to deliver crisp remarks so that when Trump [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1331.44s)]
*  lied about the economy or about his indictments or anything else, that you knew that the White [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1338.0s)]
*  House was prepared to rebut the lies, to defend the record. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1343.2s)]
*  I think that we are, Democrats sort of are where they are, at least in part because Biden [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1347.4s)]
*  hasn't really been able to do this all along. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1352.1200000000001s)]
*  Last question to you both. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1355.0800000000002s)]
*  Both of you believe, regardless of where you stand on Joe Biden, Kamala Harris switching [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1356.92s)]
*  candidates, that Donald Trump is an existential threat to American democracy. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1361.16s)]
*  And that is an important reason to back whoever is on the Democratic ticket. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1365.28s)]
*  What does that say about the state of American politics where voters feel the need to vote [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1368.92s)]
*  for a person, not because they like or support that person, but because they hate the other [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1373.84s)]
*  guy? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1377.32s)]
*  Well, let's face it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1378.32s)]
*  Many of our elections are considered by voters to be not the lesser of two evils, but the [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1379.32s)]
*  evil of two lessers. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1385.84s)]
*  It has often been the case that people hold their nose in voting. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1387.72s)]
*  But we have not seen a situation like this. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1391.8s)]
*  I want to come back to something that Liz Cheney said that to me is profound. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1394.56s)]
*  She said, I find almost all of Joe Biden's positions utterly anathematic to me. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1398.88s)]
*  But we've survived four years of bad policies before. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1406.72s)]
*  We can't survive the demise of democracy. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1410.64s)]
*  And the question now is, who is best capable of turning the dialogue back to what really [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1413.7600000000002s)]
*  matters? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1421.0400000000002s)]
*  Can we get media who basically look at the stakes of the election instead of falling [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1422.0400000000002s)]
*  back on what they like to do, which is the horse race and the polls? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1428.64s)]
*  Can we have, and this is something I've wanted for months Biden to do. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1433.24s)]
*  I want him to do it whether he stays in or not. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1436.96s)]
*  A White House summit on the threats to American democracy where you showcase the generals, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1440.5600000000002s)]
*  his chief of staff, his secretary of defense, all saying people who sugarcoat the first [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1446.72s)]
*  term don't know how bad it was, was nothing compared to what would be. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1452.16s)]
*  It may be that somebody else can do that better. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1457.1599999999999s)]
*  But what I do know is we got to get past this as quickly as possible. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1460.8s)]
*  And I also know, we're back in Chicago, which was a disaster in 1968. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1464.8s)]
*  The convention was horrific. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1470.12s)]
*  That if we can't figure out a way to pivot, however it is, and it has to be Biden voluntarily [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1472.3999999999999s)]
*  if he leaves, not being forced out where there's a resentment and the convention would reflect [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1481.48s)]
*  that, and that would be the jumping off point to the fall. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1486.72s)]
*  Or whether he gets past this and people finally unite behind him and he carries on. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1489.1200000000001s)]
*  It has to end within a week or so from where we are today. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1494.0s)]
*  Within a week or so, let's set the clock. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1497.3200000000002s)]
*  Brian Boyk, Norm Ornstein, thank you both for your analysis and discussion. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1498.88s)]
*  Appreciate it both. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx7VErz0rX4&t=1502.0800000000002s)]
