Video Description: Who is Marwan Barghouti? Why is he nicknamed “Palestine’s Mandela”? And why does Israel see him as such a big threat, even behind bars, that it is adamantly refusing to release him as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal?

In this episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered,’ Mehdi Hasan goes on a deep dive into Barghouti’s life, his activism, and most importantly, all the red flags around his trial and imprisonment by Israel.
Mehdi details what went wrong in Barghouti’s trial, from international law violations to a judge with a grudge.

Mehdi also interviews Marwan’s son, Arab Barghouthi, to discuss his father’s conditions, his treatment by Israel, and the chances of freeing him in the future. 

Barghouti’s story, like that of most Palestinians, is a mix of struggle and hope. The former Fatah official, the political party currently led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, is the most popular leader among Palestinians today. And while 89-year-old Abbas sets a low bar for competition, Mehdi explains what makes Barghouti still so popular after decades of imprisonment - and such a threat to both Benjamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas.

# The Case of Marwan Barghouti: How Israel Imprisoned Palestine’s Most Popular Leader
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800)
*  The one thing that it's hard to disagree with the Israeli and U.S. governments on when it comes to Palestine [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=0.0s)]
*  is that the Palestinians do have awful leadership. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=5.44s)]
*  I mean, President Mahmoud Abbas is 89 years old, and his original four-year presidential term ran out 15 years ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=8.44s)]
*  Abbas presides over a deeply corrupt administration and leads security forces that basically do Israel's bidding. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=16.16s)]
*  According to a poll taken last June, about 90% of Palestinians want Abbas to step down. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=22.76s)]
*  But who'd replace him? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=28.8s)]
*  Ah, if only Palestinians could find a unifying, younger leader with charisma, credibility, popular support, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  and the ability to negotiate peace with Israel and end the illegal occupation. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=37.0s)]
*  Oh wait, they don't have to find him. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=42.2s)]
*  We know where he is and where he has been for nearly 23 years now, Israel's Megiddo Prison. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=44.88s)]
*  Yes, he's the man The Economist magazine describes as the world's most important prisoner, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  who The Guardian describes as the most popular Palestinian leader alive, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  and who multiple writers and commentators have referred to as the Palestinian Mandela. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=59.8s)]
*  Marwan Barghouti is his name. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=64.75999999999999s)]
*  He's the 65-year-old former leader of Tanzim, a Palestinian militant organization, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  and an offshoot of the Fatah Party that President Abbas also belongs to. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=71.64s)]
*  And Marwan Barghouti is currently serving five consecutive life sentences behind bars in Israel for murder. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=76.0s)]
*  Now, you might be wondering, how can you compare a convicted murderer to Nelson Mandela? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=83.44000000000001s)]
*  How can he be the leader? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=88.4s)]
*  And I'll come to those murder convictions in a moment. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=90.44000000000001s)]
*  Let's just start with this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=92.92s)]
*  In that poll I mentioned from last summer, in which 90% of Palestinians said they wanted to see the back of President Abbas, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=94.4s)]
*  a majority also said they wanted the imprisoned Barghouti as their elected leader. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=101.04s)]
*  Being popular and being in prison, by the way, isn't the only thing Barghouti has in common with the late Nelson Mandela. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=106.92s)]
*  Like him, Barghouti has spent decades working towards uniting his people under one banner, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  even agreeing to a two-state solution in order to end the occupation and the conflict with Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=118.68s)]
*  As an analysis by Al Jazeera last year noted, it may well be Barghouti's commitment to a two-state solution [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=124.2s)]
*  that presents the most significant threat to an Israeli government seemingly determined to backtrack upon the agreements it undertook in Oslo in the 1990s. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=131.04s)]
*  That commitment comes, despite Barghouti being subjected to Israeli violence and terror for most of his life. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=140.44s)]
*  In a 2017 New York Times op-ed that he wrote from prison, Barghouti said, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=147.76s)]
*  I was only 15 when I was first imprisoned. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=152.68s)]
*  I was barely 18 when an Israeli interrogator forced me to spread my legs while I stood naked in the interrogation room before hitting my genitals. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  I passed out from the pain and the resulting fall left an everlasting scar on my forehead. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=162.72s)]
*  And yet, in 1996, that same Barghouti was leading a pro-peace march alongside Israeli peace activists [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  and denouncing a string of suicide bombings inside of Israel by Hamas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=176.04000000000002s)]
*  To be clear, Barghouti isn't a pacifist and has never claimed to be one. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=180.84s)]
*  In the second Intifada, he did lead a militant group in the fight against Israel, Tanzeem, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=184.44s)]
*  as he wrote in the Washington Post in 2002 during that second Intifada, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=188.88s)]
*  While I and the Fatah movement to which I belong strongly oppose attacks and the targeting of civilians inside Israel, our future neighbor, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  I reserve the right to protect myself, to resist the Israeli occupation of my country, and to fight for my freedom. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  Even in prison, Barghouti focused on trying to get freedom for his people by political means, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=206.96s)]
*  helping draft the landmark 2006 National Conciliation Document of the Prisoners, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  which called for conciliation between the various Palestinian factions and the two-state solution on 1967 lines. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=217.36s)]
*  He even got Hamas to sign up to it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=224.16s)]
*  Now, I could go on and on about the work Barghouti has done both inside and outside of prison, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=226.84s)]
*  but I have to address the elephant in the room, why he's in prison in the first place. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=230.96s)]
*  Because while Barghouti is seen as a hero by many Palestinians, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=236.16s)]
*  he's seen as a terrorist by most Israelis and was convicted of multiple murders in an Israeli court. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  Now, the terrorist title? Who cares? Israel calls every Palestinian they don't like a terrorist. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=245.16s)]
*  The US called Nelson Mandela a terrorist and had him on a terrorist watch list right up until 2008. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=250.08s)]
*  But the murder convictions on the face of it are bad. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=255.76s)]
*  On the face of it, that is, because there are so many things wrong with the conviction and with the imprisonment of Marwan Barghouti, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=258.92s)]
*  so many red flags that suggest his imprisonment by Israel may very well have been about taking him out of the political arena [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=265.20000000000005s)]
*  and eliminating the chance of having that elusive partner for peace. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=272.44s)]
*  In August of 2001, for example, he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on the Fatah Party headquarters [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=276.84000000000003s)]
*  that according to Israel, he was not the target of, which I would say is red flag number one. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=283.04s)]
*  They were already trying to kill him long before they'd convicted him of any crimes. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=288.04s)]
*  Then in April of 2002, he was captured by Israeli forces in Ramallah, where he was kept incommunicado for a month. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=292.48s)]
*  Red flag number two. During his interrogation, Barghouti has said several methods of torture were used against him, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=298.92s)]
*  including sleep deprivation, hours spent sitting in painful positions on a chair with nails protruding from its back, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=304.08000000000004s)]
*  and even false information leaks that claim he confessed to the crimes he's accused of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  and that they implicate the former Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=315.56s)]
*  Two, that's red flag number three. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=318.36s)]
*  After his arrest, Israel decided to hold Barghouti's trial in Tel Aviv. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=321.36s)]
*  Red flag number four, and here's why that's a huge red flag, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=324.96s)]
*  because he was arrested in the occupied West Bank, but tried in Tel Aviv inside occupier Israel. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=328.56s)]
*  And yet according to Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=334.96s)]
*  individual or mass forcible transfers as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=338.0s)]
*  to the territory of the occupying power or to that of any other country, occupied or not, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  are prohibited regardless of their motive. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=348.44s)]
*  But, Mehdi, why didn't they use that argument for his defence? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  Oh, but they did. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=356.12s)]
*  Barghouti presented five different arguments as to why he should not be tried in an Israeli court. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=357.79999999999995s)]
*  Number one, the unlawful abduction from his home in Ramallah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  Number two, his illegal transfer to Israel. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=365.2s)]
*  Number three, the ability for the Palestinian government to try its own citizens according to the Oslo Accords. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=367.71999999999997s)]
*  Number four, that he should enjoy prisoner of war status pursuant to the Third Geneva Convention. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  And finally, number five, the violation of his parliamentary immunity deriving from his status [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=378.48s)]
*  as an elected member of the Palestinian Legislative Council. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  All five objections, surprise, were rejected by the Israeli judge. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  Red flags number five, six, seven, eight and nine. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=390.16s)]
*  Barghouti, by the way, was accused of being involved in 37 attacks or attempted attacks on Israel [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=394.32000000000005s)]
*  Between December 2000 and April 2002, the period often referred to as the Second Intifada, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  which is Arabic for shaking off. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=404.16s)]
*  His speeches in court were far from those of a violent criminal, though, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  who funds or recruits terrorists. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=410.68s)]
*  Nor were they Hamas-style calls for the end for the destruction of Israel either. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=413.0s)]
*  Here's one of those speeches from the courtroom. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=417.44000000000005s)]
*  You know, everybody in this world knows that Marwan Barghouti is fighting for peace. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  I am a peace man. I was trying to do everything for the peace between the two peoples. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=427.12s)]
*  I do believe that the best solution for the two peoples, two states, for the two peoples, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=435.56s)]
*  there is no any solution except this solution. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=442.44s)]
*  But it never mattered what Barghouti said in court nor what defense he presented, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=446.56s)]
*  because his verdict was decided before the trial even began. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=450.4s)]
*  He knew it, which is why he was silent for the majority of the trial [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=453.68s)]
*  and refused to recognize the authority of Israel's courts. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=456.92s)]
*  In his first appearance in court, for example, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=459.96s)]
*  Barghouti described himself as a fighter for peace for both peoples, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=462.64s)]
*  but was then interrupted by Judge Sarah Zarota, the presiding judge in his case, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=466.24s)]
*  who said, quote, one who fights for peace doesn't turn people into bombs and kill children. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=471.24s)]
*  Red flag number ten, folks. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=477.08s)]
*  Look, I'm no lawyer, but that sounds like a pretty outrageous thing to say to the man whose trial [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=479.24s)]
*  you're presiding over and who hasn't yet been convicted of any crimes. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=484.32s)]
*  Super impartial judge there. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=488.68s)]
*  Mawan Barghouti did not get a fair trial. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=491.08s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=493.92s)]
*  An observer sent to his 2004 trial in Israel by the governing council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=495.2s)]
*  said in his official report, quote, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=500.92s)]
*  the numerous breaches of international law recalled in this report [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  make it impossible to conclude that Mr. Barghouti was given a fair trial. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=506.32s)]
*  In fact, during the proceedings, around 100 witnesses were called to testify against Barghouti, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=511.8s)]
*  but only 21 of them were actually in a position to testify directly regarding his role in the alleged attacks. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=517.16s)]
*  That's red flag number 11. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  Of those 21 witnesses, and get ready for this, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=526.4399999999999s)]
*  none of them actually accused him of being involved in the attacks. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=529.36s)]
*  Another red flag. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=533.72s)]
*  And 12 of them explicitly told the court he was not involved. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=535.08s)]
*  Red flag number 13. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=539.92s)]
*  Again, I'm no lawyer, but that sounds like he was innocent, not guilty. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=541.84s)]
*  When the dust settled, Barghouti was acquitted of 21 counts of murder in 33 attacks [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=548.8s)]
*  by the court due to a lack of evidence. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=554.4399999999999s)]
*  Red flag number 14. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=557.2s)]
*  But nevertheless, they managed to convict him on five separate counts of murder, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=559.16s)]
*  and he was handed five life sentences in Israeli prison. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=563.68s)]
*  Will he ever get out? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=568.3199999999999s)]
*  In the past, some Israeli peace advocates have suggested a pardon for Barghouti. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=570.04s)]
*  But listen to this. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=574.72s)]
*  In the wake of October the 7th, Hamas added Marwan Barghouti's release to its terms [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=575.68s)]
*  regards a ceasefire deal with Israel. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  And yet, last May, Middle East Eye reported that senior officials in the Palestinian Authority, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=583.4s)]
*  not just the Israeli government, the PA, insisted Barghouti not be released from Israeli prison, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=587.68s)]
*  not be part of the ceasefire negotiations because they believe, wait for it, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=594.3199999999999s)]
*  quote, Barghouti's release would threaten the leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=597.68s)]
*  The PA apparently said to Israel, keep him. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  We don't want him back. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=606.68s)]
*  Now, they've since denied those reports, but it is obvious that Barghouti threatens Abbas's [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=608.36s)]
*  decrepit, weak, and corrupt leadership, and also threatens Israel's far-right [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=613.68s)]
*  pro-occupation and anti-peace government. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=618.04s)]
*  Again, don't take my word for it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=621.0799999999999s)]
*  Amir Ayalon, former head of Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=623.3199999999999s)]
*  referring to Barghouti, said this just last year, quote, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=627.12s)]
*  Look into the Palestinian polls. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  He is the only leader who can lead Palestinians to a state alongside Israel, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=632.56s)]
*  first of all because he believes in the concept of two states, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  and secondly because he won his legitimacy by sitting in our jails. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=639.24s)]
*  Yes, he has won legitimacy by sitting in an Israeli jail cell for so long. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=644.36s)]
*  The question now is, how long will he stay alive in that cell? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=649.88s)]
*  Since October the 7th, he's been held in solitary confinement in conditions that even [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=654.96s)]
*  one Israeli human rights group has described as torture. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=658.76s)]
*  Barghouti's family and Palestinian human rights groups say he's been repeatedly [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=662.0400000000001s)]
*  assaulted by Israeli prison guards, which the Israeli authorities, of course, deny. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=665.48s)]
*  And so, with each passing day, with each stretch in solitary confinement, and with [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=670.24s)]
*  each human rights infringement, the chances of Marwan Barghouti ever getting out of [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=674.48s)]
*  prison and leading his people in a peace process with Israel continue to decline. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=678.96s)]
*  Palestine's Mandela has not yet had his long walk to freedom, and nor, of course, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=684.64s)]
*  at the Palestinian people. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss the story of Marwan Barghouti and the future of Marwan [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=692.32s)]
*  Barghouti, and so much more, is his son, Arab Barghouti, who joins me now from [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=696.1600000000001s)]
*  Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=701.0400000000001s)]
*  Arabs, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=704.24s)]
*  Let's start with the most obvious, urgent question. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=706.64s)]
*  What is your father's condition like right now in prison? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=709.76s)]
*  I mentioned a moment ago that you have said he was brutally assaulted in [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=713.16s)]
*  September by prison guards. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=716.64s)]
*  He's been in solitary confinement a lot. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=718.7199999999999s)]
*  What's his condition like right now? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=720.52s)]
*  Are you able to communicate with him? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=721.5999999999999s)]
*  So, Maddie, since October 7th, I think, like many others of the Palestinian [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=724.3599999999999s)]
*  political prisoners, my father is going under the collective punishment policy of [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=730.28s)]
*  the Israeli government. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=735.52s)]
*  He's been targeted by them. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=736.52s)]
*  Right after October 7th, he was in the Ofer prison, and the head of Ofer prison [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=738.56s)]
*  came to him, and in front of other prisoners, he asked him to put his hands [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=742.92s)]
*  behind his back and to kneel to try to tell the other prisoners that, if I can [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=749.68s)]
*  humiliate your leader, I can humiliate you all, which he refused. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=757.0s)]
*  So they forced him to do it, which got his shoulder dislocated, and then they [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=761.48s)]
*  moved him between prison after prison. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=766.0400000000001s)]
*  They put him in a very tiny cell in solitary confinement. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=769.12s)]
*  They put speakers with the highest volume at the door of his cell to prevent him [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=773.36s)]
*  from sleeping and running the Israeli national anthem nonstop for days, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=779.24s)]
*  putting spotlight in his head, preventing him from having hygiene supplies. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=785.32s)]
*  And then on March 6th, we know that he was attacked brutally and assaulted by three [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=790.28s)]
*  to four Israeli prison guards who started beating him up, took him to an area, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=796.24s)]
*  dragged him to an area which didn't have any camera surveillance, and they started [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=802.0s)]
*  beating him up, which caused him many injuries. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=805.6800000000001s)]
*  And then we learned, unfortunately, that on September 9th, they did it again, and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=808.64s)]
*  they ended him in many areas of his body, especially in his ribs, in his foot, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=816.36s)]
*  in his forehead, and he said that this time he thought that it was an [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=823.08s)]
*  assassination attempt or the least to cause him a long-term disability that [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=828.84s)]
*  would make him dysfunctional to work in the political arena in the future. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=833.28s)]
*  That abuse and torture sounds horrific. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=839.16s)]
*  Are you able to communicate with him directly? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=842.2s)]
*  So we haven't been able, none of the family has been able to see him for the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=845.0s)]
*  past 18 months because it's very important for people to understand that [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=848.6s)]
*  this had been happening way before October 7th. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=852.2s)]
*  I haven't seen him in two years. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=855.56s)]
*  I barely see him every two to three years. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=857.04s)]
*  They allow me, and I haven't been able to touch my father for 23 years now. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=859.4s)]
*  The conditions that the prisoners go through are really bad, but after October 7th, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=866.24s)]
*  it became a real hell for prisoners. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=872.12s)]
*  He's been only visited by his lawyer for three times only since October 7th, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=876.2800000000001s)]
*  and no other person has been able to see him otherwise. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=883.36s)]
*  Your father's story is one that surfaces year in, year out, especially as Israel [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=887.5600000000001s)]
*  carries out its brutal assault on Palestinians, both in the occupied Gaza [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=891.0s)]
*  Strip and the occupied West Bank. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=894.76s)]
*  Given what we've seen over the last 18 months, the bloodiest year for [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=896.76s)]
*  Palestinians in modern history, one of the worst years on the West Bank too, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=900.0799999999999s)]
*  not just Gaza, do you feel like the chances of him coming out of prison [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=903.64s)]
*  since October 7th have gone up, gone down, stayed the same? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=907.92s)]
*  I think it goes ups and downs, and I think that throughout the 23 years, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=913.16s)]
*  if I learned a lesson as a family member of a political prisoner, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=917.56s)]
*  I learned to manage my expectations because we've been disappointed before. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  With that being said, I do feel that my father will be released. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=926.92s)]
*  I really hope that the thousands and thousands of Palestinian political [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=930.0s)]
*  prisoners are only released, even the Israeli hostages, everyone we really [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=933.12s)]
*  hope that gets released. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=940.4799999999999s)]
*  We do feel that there is a real concrete opportunity for him to be released. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=942.9599999999999s)]
*  And I do think that his release will play a positive role, not only for the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=947.56s)]
*  Palestinian people or the building of the Palestinian state, but also for the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=951.88s)]
*  stability of the whole region because of what he represents, what he thinks, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=956.52s)]
*  his political vision and what his influence on the Palestinian people. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=960.48s)]
*  We know that Hamas has said they want your father freed from prison as part [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=966.4399999999999s)]
*  of a ceasefire deal in Gaza. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=970.52s)]
*  Do you think that's something the Palestinian Authority, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=973.28s)]
*  President Abbas, would also get behind? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=975.3199999999999s)]
*  Have they got behind it? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=977.0799999999999s)]
*  Some people are saying they don't want your father out of prison. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=978.3199999999999s)]
*  We hear these narratives. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=982.24s)]
*  To be honest with you, our position is very clear. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=983.92s)]
*  I think that I always say that any Palestinian who doesn't want my father to be released, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=986.4s)]
*  they need to test their DNA. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=991.9599999999999s)]
*  My father is not only important for, you know, for Fatah or for this part or that part, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=994.24s)]
*  but also for the Palestinian cause because of his influence. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1002.4799999999999s)]
*  He's a unifying figure. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1005.36s)]
*  He represents hope to the Palestinian people. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1006.76s)]
*  And of course, there is this dirty political competition that exists, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1009.1999999999999s)]
*  but I refuse to believe that any Palestinian wouldn't want my father to be released. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1014.8s)]
*  He's someone who gets his credibility and strength from the people, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1020.0799999999999s)]
*  not from anything else. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1023.68s)]
*  And the people showed their trust to him not because he promised the people with [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1025.32s)]
*  building roads or infrastructure or hospitals. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1030.6399999999999s)]
*  It's because he promised the people that if the last thing that he has to give to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1033.12s)]
*  Palestine is his own life and his own years, he's willing to do so. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1038.3200000000002s)]
*  And that's exactly what he's sacrificing right now. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1041.88s)]
*  Have you or your family, your mother, have you met with President Abbas to discuss [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1045.0800000000002s)]
*  your father's fate? Has President Abbas told you he wants to see him freed? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1048.5600000000002s)]
*  But earlier, like years ago, yes. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  Recently, we haven't met him. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1056.1200000000001s)]
*  We do feel like we really hope that the Palestinian Authority and Fatah, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1059.28s)]
*  because you need to remember that Fatah, the ruling party of the Palestinian [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1064.08s)]
*  Authority, is the party of my father. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1067.6799999999998s)]
*  He's been a proud Fatah member for more than 50 years. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1070.04s)]
*  He is someone who served as the youngest Revolutionary Council member in Fatah. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  In the late 80s, he was voted as the Central Committee member of Fatah twice. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1080.24s)]
*  And right now, he practices as a Central Committee member of Fatah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1086.0s)]
*  I really think that a strong Fatah, a unified Fatah means a strong Palestine. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1090.2s)]
*  So we really hope that there is reconciliation within Fatah and then we [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1096.56s)]
*  can work on the whole Palestinian political scene because we are hungry for unity. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1101.8s)]
*  Your father's been in Israeli jail for over 22 years. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1107.32s)]
*  You mentioned a moment ago that he believes some of the attacks on him are not [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1110.92s)]
*  just to try and kill him, but even to incapacitate him, to disable him, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1113.96s)]
*  to make him unable to play a leadership role were he ever to be released. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1117.36s)]
*  We've seen Palestinians who have spent much shorter stretches of time in Israeli prison. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1121.9199999999998s)]
*  We've seen them come out and with all sorts of PTSD, all sorts of kind of damage to their [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1126.56s)]
*  physical and mental health, changed people such as the horrors they've endured inside [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1132.36s)]
*  the Israeli prison gulag. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  Your father's been there over two decades. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1140.9599999999998s)]
*  Do you believe he could even, do you believe he'll be able to lead when he comes out of prison? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1143.96s)]
*  Has he been changed in ways that we just can't imagine? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1149.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1154.2s)]
*  I really, really trust, have my trust in God first and in my father because he's someone [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1155.3600000000001s)]
*  who's been through a lot in his life. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1162.08s)]
*  You mentioned how he got arrested the first time at the age of 15, then at the age of 18, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1163.8s)]
*  then he went on and off to prison in the 80s and then he got exiled from Palestine in 87, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1169.1599999999999s)]
*  got back in 94 and not only he got elected as a parliament member, of course, but also [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1177.36s)]
*  he worked for peace. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1184.32s)]
*  He worked for coexistence between the Israeli and the Palestinian people because along with [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1185.36s)]
*  the Palestinian leadership, he believed that peace is possible. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1192.04s)]
*  And then he got arrested because of course he supports the Palestinian struggle towards [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1196.76s)]
*  freedom, towards liberation. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1202.08s)]
*  Is he still a two state solution guy? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1203.48s)]
*  Well, I know that my father, despite the fact that he knows that it has a very slim chance [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1207.8s)]
*  and he's not delusional, he knows the reality that it has a very slim chance. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1215.36s)]
*  And if you talk to my generation and you say the two state solution, they wouldn't listen [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1219.56s)]
*  to you anymore because we feel that it's the magic word that the Western leaders use [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1223.8s)]
*  for the Palestinian people to hypnotise us into believing that there is a hope for a [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1230.12s)]
*  political solution. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1235.9199999999998s)]
*  But my father supports a political solution. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1236.8s)]
*  He sees that the two state solution is the only one that makes sense, but he's very open [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1239.24s)]
*  towards any solution that brings us, the Palestinian, living with freedom and dignity, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1243.08s)]
*  which is the most important thing for him. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1249.72s)]
*  Israeli parliament, Arab passed legislation in November that allows the government to [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1251.92s)]
*  deport the family members of so-called terrorists, including its own citizens, to the Gaza Strip, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1255.8400000000001s)]
*  to other locations. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1261.04s)]
*  For someone like yourself or your mother, Fadwa, what could that mean for your future [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1262.04s)]
*  in the West Bank given that Israel does in fact see your father as a terrorist? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1267.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I think that, you know, if you look at the whole of the Palestinian people, we [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1272.96s)]
*  are all suffering in our own way. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1277.2s)]
*  In the West Bank, we are going through settler terrorism. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1279.72s)]
*  In Jerusalem, they are going through threats of getting kicked out. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1283.0s)]
*  And the Palestinians that live inside 48 areas also feel threatened all the time and [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1287.64s)]
*  discriminated against. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1293.04s)]
*  And of course, the genocide that is going on in Gaza. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1294.16s)]
*  And my point here is that whatever suffering that we will endure or we have endured already [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1297.44s)]
*  is nothing different than any other Palestinian. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1303.88s)]
*  We're just part of the Palestinian people who are struggling for our freedom. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1306.2s)]
*  And that means that we are going to pay the price. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1311.88s)]
*  My father and his fellow prisoners are paying the steepest price, of course, after our people [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1314.5600000000002s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1319.76s)]
*  But if that means that we are going to pay any price, we're willing to do so because [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1320.76s)]
*  I don't think we have any other choice. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1325.0800000000002s)]
*  And my father used to always tell me that hope is sometimes a privilege. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1327.0s)]
*  And being hopeless is a privilege that we can't have as Palestinians. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1331.52s)]
*  So it doesn't exist in our dictionary to feel hopeless, regardless of what tactics [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1335.84s)]
*  they would use against us. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1340.4399999999998s)]
*  Well said. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1343.04s)]
*  U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen, who's a Democrat from Maryland, who's been on this show, he [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1344.04s)]
*  said in the past, quote, the Biden administration should make it very clear to the Netanyahu [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1347.56s)]
*  government that if Barghouti is harmed or killed in prison, it would throw gas on a [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1351.32s)]
*  raging fire. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1355.4399999999998s)]
*  Barghouti is probably the most popular Palestinian leader. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1356.76s)]
*  That's true in the West Bank and in Gaza. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1359.52s)]
*  Have there been other U.S. politicians that you know of that have reached out to you to [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1362.44s)]
*  try and support your father's release from prison? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1365.68s)]
*  What would you like to see the U.S. government doing here? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1368.3s)]
*  I would like to see the American government seeing us as human beings and understanding [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1371.56s)]
*  the influence of my father on the Palestinian cause. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1377.3200000000002s)]
*  You said it perfectly. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1381.14s)]
*  I think that the Israeli government feels threatened with someone like my father because [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1382.24s)]
*  political vision aligns perfectly with the international community and international [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1389.56s)]
*  law. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1394.2s)]
*  He's someone who believes that as Palestinians, we need to keep struggling for our freedom. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1395.2s)]
*  But at the same time, he's someone who believes that we should give opportunity for the political [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1401.6799999999998s)]
*  solutions. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1407.0s)]
*  He's a politician. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1408.0s)]
*  He is someone who holds a PhD in political science. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1409.0s)]
*  He teaches politics in Israeli studies. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1412.04s)]
*  And the reason why he does that is that because he sees Palestine as a future state and he's [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1415.68s)]
*  someone who wants to contribute into building the future state of Palestine. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1422.8600000000001s)]
*  I think it's very clear that the American government, of course, with their bias, and [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1427.16s)]
*  this is something that we always talk about, are really helping the division and the conflict [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1432.48s)]
*  to always grow because they keep spoiling the Israeli government. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1442.08s)]
*  They keep spoiling the right wing, the far right wing of the Israeli government. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1445.64s)]
*  They keep calling us terrorists. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1449.96s)]
*  I've never heard them calling someone like Ben-Vir or Smotraich or even Netanyahu a terrorist. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1451.4s)]
*  I think that they need to change their policies against the Palestinian people and see who [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1458.84s)]
*  can be a partner for future peace and for stability in the Middle East. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1462.84s)]
*  One last question, a more personal question. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1469.08s)]
*  You mentioned earlier that it's been over two decades since you've been able to touch [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1470.88s)]
*  your dad, make contact with your dad because he's been behind bars. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1474.5200000000002s)]
*  How old were you the last time he gave you a hug? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1478.92s)]
*  What is your memory from childhood of your dad? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1481.48s)]
*  I was 11 when my father was arrested. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1485.6000000000001s)]
*  I still remember my first, I would say, trauma when I was 10 years old. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1490.5200000000002s)]
*  I opened the TV and I would never forget on Abu Dhabi TV channel, I saw a headline that [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1496.6s)]
*  says that Marwan Barghouti has been assassinated. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1505.76s)]
*  After five to 10 minutes, I couldn't even understand what was happening. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1509.44s)]
*  After five to 10 minutes, they corrected it into an assassination attempt. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1514.28s)]
*  This is part of my childhood that I had to endure and deal with. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1518.76s)]
*  And then at the age of 11, I still remember my last hug with him. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  He knew that Israelis are going to invade the West Bank, which means that it would be [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1530.08s)]
*  very, very hard for us to see him again. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1534.76s)]
*  And it was actually the last hug because after that he got arrested. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1537.36s)]
*  The last time I saw him without glass between us, because whenever I visit him with glass [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1542.08s)]
*  is when I went to the court, the Israeli court in Tel Aviv. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1547.52s)]
*  I was 12 years old and at that day, he looked at me and he called me to come to him. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  I ran to him and I would never forget the Israeli settler that slapped me in the face. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQKN8xvR800&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
