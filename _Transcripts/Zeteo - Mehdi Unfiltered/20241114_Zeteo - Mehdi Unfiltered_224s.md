Video Description: Meet President-elect Donald J. Trump’s candidate for secretary of defense: Fox News weekend host Pete Hegseth. He was announced as the pick for the highest-ranking leader in the Department of Defense, despite being widely unqualified and inexperienced.

In this video, Mehdi Hasan unpacks six of Hegseth’s extreme, war-mongering views and ideas, all of which are likely to break Trump’s dubious promise to bring lasting peace—to the Middle East or anywhere else.

Mehdi explains that Hegseth is, among other things, an “Islamophobic, Christian Zionist hawk,” and argues that it’s not the lack of experience or his association with right-wing media that should worry people the most – it’s his clear love for war, war crimes, and war criminals.

# Why Trump’s Defense Pick Should Scare The Hell Out Of You
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw)
*  Towards the end of his presidential campaign, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump attempted to brand himself as the peace candidate, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=2.44s)]
*  the anti-war guy, a delusional lie some on the left, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=5.44s)]
*  including even some Muslim and Arab voters, fell for. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=8.64s)]
*  But, Mehdi, how can you say it was a lie? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=11.78s)]
*  Trump's not even back in office yet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Well, meet Pete Hegseth, the man Donald Trump has nominated [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=14.82s)]
*  to be his new Secretary of Defense, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=18.62s)]
*  a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=20.72s)]
*  a TV host on Fox with zero experience of governing, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=22.82s)]
*  who was reportedly picked by Trump because he has the look. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=26.22s)]
*  But it's not the look or his lack of experience [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=29.86s)]
*  that should really bother you, it's Hegseth's love of war [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=32.02s)]
*  and war crimes and war criminals. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=35.4s)]
*  For example, while most people in Washington [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  now accept the Iraq War was at best a mistake, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=39.8s)]
*  at worst a disaster, Hegseth, for a very long time, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=41.94s)]
*  was a proud fan of that illegal invasion. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  Here he is in 2016. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=47.74s)]
*  The Iraq War is an example of what America got right [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=49.24s)]
*  when we got it right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=52.28s)]
*  Back in 2017, Hegseth pushed the insane idea [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  that the U.S. should consider launching a preemptive strike [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=56.68s)]
*  on nuclear-armed North Korea. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=60.019999999999996s)]
*  What, we'll annihilate North Korea after we're dead? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=61.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=64.92s)]
*  We have to do something now. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=66.02s)]
*  There's merit in a preemptive strike. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=67.12s)]
*  You got to do it right. It's got to be decisive. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=68.7s)]
*  In 2020, Hegseth openly encouraged Trump [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=71.6s)]
*  to commit war crimes, saying international law [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=74.1s)]
*  is rigged against the U.S. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=75.96s)]
*  and even tried to justify the U.S. bombing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=77.94s)]
*  religious and cultural sites in Iran. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=80.24s)]
*  We need to rewrite the rules that are advantageous to us. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=82.53999999999999s)]
*  I don't want to hit cultural sites on purpose, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  but if you're using one to harbor your most dangerous weapons, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  then that should be on the target list, too. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=90.24s)]
*  And the president did... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=91.83999999999999s)]
*  Ah, the classic human shields argument. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  Sounds like he'll get along great with Netanyahu. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=94.52s)]
*  Oh, and speaking of Israel, Hegseth is a Christian Zionist [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=96.88s)]
*  who proudly has a Jerusalem cross tattooed on his chest, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=100.36s)]
*  as you can see from his Instagram, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=103.66s)]
*  and has openly advocated for building [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=105.41999999999999s)]
*  the Third Temple in Jerusalem, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=107.52s)]
*  which is a dream of far-right Israeli fanatics [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=109.3s)]
*  and requires the destruction of the Al Aqsa Mosque. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  The declaration of Jerusalem as the capital was a miracle, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=115.06s)]
*  and there's no reason why the miracle [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=118.4s)]
*  of the reestablishment of the temple [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  on the Temple Mount is not possible. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=122.94s)]
*  Hegseth is also an advocate for war criminals [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=124.94s)]
*  and alleged war criminals. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=127.28s)]
*  Back in 2019, he was the guy who helped persuade [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=128.68s)]
*  Donald Trump to pardon three soldiers convicted, charged, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=131.08s)]
*  or accused of horrific war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=134.32s)]
*  He was open about his support for them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  These are men who went into the most dangerous places on Earth [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=139.86s)]
*  with a job to defend us and made tough calls [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=142.78s)]
*  on a moment's notice. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=145.06s)]
*  They're not war criminals, they're warriors. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=146.32s)]
*  Of course, we shouldn't be surprised about Hegseth [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  being totally fine with the killing of Arabs or Afghans. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  He's been pushing Islamophobic bigoted nonsense for years. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=153.42s)]
*  He literally wrote a book called American Crusade [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=156.76s)]
*  in which he complained about Muslim birth rates [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=159.85999999999999s)]
*  and praised the Crusaders [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=162.1s)]
*  for pushing back against Muslim hordes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=163.73999999999998s)]
*  In 2016, on Fox, he even went to Hamtramck, Michigan, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=166.39999999999998s)]
*  the Muslim-majority town, where local Arab politicians [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=169.94s)]
*  and imams just endorsed Trump as the peace candidate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=172.68s)]
*  He went to Hamtramck and said this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=175.78s)]
*  about the local Muslim population. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=177.58s)]
*  There's a lot of anxiety. We're not sure if... [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  They're not actually integrating as much as we'd want them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=181.58s)]
*  27 languages in the schools, segmentation in the town. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=184.28s)]
*  There's a Yemeni portion, there's a Bangladeshi part. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=187.12s)]
*  There isn't as much assimilation, folks. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=189.32s)]
*  Hegseth is an Islamophobic Christian Zionist hawk, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=191.5s)]
*  and he'll be in charge of the U.S. military. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  Now, his defenders say, well, he's a smart guy. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  He went to Princeton, he has a master's from Harvard. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=199.74s)]
*  True, but he's also this guy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=201.8s)]
*  I don't think I've washed my hands for ten years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=204.8s)]
*  Really, I don't... I don't really wash my hands ever. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=206.9s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't believe in germs. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  So, a word of advice to generals at the Pentagon. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=213.78s)]
*  Maybe avoid shaking hands with your new boss. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv2lgSkWIiw&t=216.68s)]
