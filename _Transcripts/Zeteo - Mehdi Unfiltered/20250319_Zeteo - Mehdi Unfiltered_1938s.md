Video Description: After Rep. Al Green interrupted Donald Trump’s Congress address, 10 Democrats angered their party base by voting with Republicans to censure him. One vote came from Connecticut Representative Jim Himes, who joins Mehdi Hasan as they CLASH on why he voted to censure Green.

_“What this is really about is the rules,”_ Himes says. _“In a world where everybody thinks that politicians have no principle and believe that it’s okay when our side does it — that’s a bad message to send.”_

_“The Republicans could have all voted to censure him and he could have accepted this. He didn't need ten Democrats to join in,”_ counters Mehdi.

# Mehdi PRESSES Democrat Congressman on Voting With Republicans
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s)
*  Many of you will have seen Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, being removed from the chamber [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=0.0s)]
*  when he disrupted President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress after he stood up, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=5.14s)]
*  shook his cane at the president, and accused him of lacking a mandate. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=9.18s)]
*  Many of you will have cheered Al Green's protest of a president who speaks and acts like an authoritarian, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  but not 10 of his House Democratic colleagues who voted with all House Republicans [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=18.28s)]
*  to censure Congressman Green for his behavior. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=22.48s)]
*  When I saw one of those 10, Congressman Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=25.18s)]
*  talking about the importance of decorum and civility, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=28.4s)]
*  I tweeted, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=31.2s)]
*  We are 10 years into the Trump era. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=32.199999999999996s)]
*  Over a month into Trump Term 2, we watched a speech in which Trump castigated Dems as radical left lunatics [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=34.4s)]
*  and used a racist jibe against a Democratic senator. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=39.7s)]
*  And this Democratic representative, Jim Himes, is still talking about decorum and civility. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=42.5s)]
*  Really? Really? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  To which the congressman responded, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=49.4s)]
*  Really? Really? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=51.2s)]
*  Champions for what is good and right cannot win by suggesting [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=52.7s)]
*  that what is good and right can be compromised just because the other side does it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=55.7s)]
*  That's crappy moral reasoning, and how you lose politically. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  Decorum may not matter much, but what is right does. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=62.5s)]
*  So let's continue that debate in person. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=66.3s)]
*  I appreciate Congressman Jim Himes joining me now here in the studio with me to continue [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=67.8s)]
*  our hope, our good faith disagreement about the best way to approach Donald Trump and his authoritarian administration. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=72.9s)]
*  In your own words, Congressman, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=79.4s)]
*  Why did you vote to censure your colleague Al Green for doing something a lot of grassroots Dems are glad he did? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And by the way, you can be glad he did it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=87.10000000000001s)]
*  And I'm sort of ambivalent on that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=90.4s)]
*  And also vote to censure. Why? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=92.0s)]
*  And that may actually be the way I feel about it. Why? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=94.5s)]
*  It's not really about decorum and civility. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=96.9s)]
*  I put that in my tweet. Decorum and civility are important parts of a functional system. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  And yeah, I think we should be a little careful about the political aspects of casting aside decorum and civility. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  But what this is really about is the rules. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=108.0s)]
*  Now I get this all the time. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=111.7s)]
*  And as you might imagine, the last 72 hours, I've gotten it a lot. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=113.2s)]
*  Don't follow the rules. Do not follow the rules. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=115.8s)]
*  Well, so then I ask activists who take that approach. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=118.3s)]
*  What rules shall I not follow? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=120.9s)]
*  Shall I stop following the rules against violence? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=122.1s)]
*  Can I now lie regularly because all of the rules are suspended? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=124.3s)]
*  And I ask those questions to make the point that when we start talking about breaking the rules, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=128.5s)]
*  we have to be enormously careful. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=133.6s)]
*  And we have over a century structured a way in which we break the rules and we feel good about it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=136.0s)]
*  This is the tradition of civil disobedience. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=142.5s)]
*  And of course, this was constructed by people like Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, who said two things. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=144.8s)]
*  An unjust rule can be righteously and in fact should be righteously broken. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=150.3s)]
*  Now whether the House procedures are unjust rules, we'll set that aside. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=155.3s)]
*  And then this thing too part, and this is the nodding to the importance of rules and the concepts of the rules, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=159.1s)]
*  as the thing that stopped us from chaos, you can break an unjust rule and then you happily accept the circumstances. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=165.8s)]
*  Which by the way is where Al Green was. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  He said, I'm going to get in the way and I expect there to be consequences. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  And on Twitter, he put the resolution and he said guilty. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=178.9s)]
*  So as a principle of reasoning, and this is why I talked about crappy moral reasoning, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=183.3s)]
*  you can't say, and it's completely inconsistent with the traditions of civil disobedience, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=187.9s)]
*  to say you should break the rules but seek to evade the consequences. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=192.4s)]
*  So just to finish this thought, so why does Jim Himes vote for it? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=196.0s)]
*  Because I voted for the censure of Joe Wilson when he shouted at President Obama. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  So now I get asked by a, let's sort of transition this to a little bit of politics. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  I get asked by an unaffiliated voter who isn't very online. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  Wait, you voted to chastise Joe Wilson and then you didn't vote in the case of Al Green. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=217.0s)]
*  In a world where everybody thinks that politicians have no principle and believe that it's okay when our side does it, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=222.8s)]
*  that's a bad message to send. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=230.5s)]
*  So you said a lot there, a lot of interesting points, fair points, just on one of them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=232.1s)]
*  Even if you accept the consequences of what you do, the Republicans could have all voted to censure him [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=236.8s)]
*  and he could have accepted this concept. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=241.6s)]
*  He didn't need 10 Democrats to join him. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=242.8s)]
*  To use your analogy of Mahandas Gandhi, of the Mahatma, you know, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  he accepted the consequences of the British punishing him, but his own side didn't punish him too. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=248.5s)]
*  Liking this video? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=253.1s)]

*  And tap the bell so you never miss a video or live show. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=257.3s)]
*  But if you want early access to exclusive content, then you have to head to Zateo.com and subscribe now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=260.5s)]
*  You'll be supporting fearless independent journalism. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=266.7s)]
*  The question is, is punishment righteous? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=270.6s)]
*  And you can say no, it's not, which is inconsistent with the traditional understanding of civil disobedience. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=273.9s)]
*  And you can be angry at me for participating in that, which is a bit odd if you believe that the punishment is righteous. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=279.8s)]
*  But what you can't do is to say we get the one half of civil disobedience breaking the rules, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  but we're going to seek to evade the other half. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  Why, again, you're absolutely right. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=293.6s)]
*  I have thought about this a lot. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=295.3s)]
*  I could have voted no and I could have constructed an argument that would have been about what is right and true. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=298.1s)]
*  The people who visited my workplace on January 6th with the intent to stop a procedure, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=304.3s)]
*  to get in the way of the operations of the Congress, horrible, horrible thing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=308.6s)]
*  In that moment, they and their supporters believed that they were righteous. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  So you can't simply rely on your own belief of righteousness to say I'm going to break the rules and I'm not going to accept the consequences. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=318.8s)]
*  I'm going to push back and say you kind of can because it sounds like you're a little bit both-sizing this, right? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=326.5s)]
*  The people who came to Congress violently to interrupt a legal proceeding were breaking the law [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=330.3s)]
*  and doing immoral, dishonest things, right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=336.3s)]
*  Whatever they believed in their heads and many of them who knows what they believed in their heads. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=339.09999999999997s)]
*  That is not the same thing as a congressman standing up against a president who is being authoritarian, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=342.3s)]
*  is violating the Constitution from day one and taking what you said. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=348.8s)]
*  You even began the interview saying I kind of admired what he did in a sense. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=352.7s)]
*  It was a good thing maybe that he did it. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=356.09999999999997s)]
*  So I'm not sure I get this argument saying if they do it doesn't mean we should do it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=357.8s)]
*  And this is going to sound very partisan. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=363.0s)]
*  But when they do it, it's wrong and maybe in this case it's right. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=364.4s)]
*  Yeah, but Mehdi, the whole concept of a society under law is that you and me and no one else, not the young man... [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=367.5s)]
*  He didn't break any laws. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=373.79999999999995s)]
*  People on January 6th broke laws. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=375.4s)]
*  I understand. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  Rules. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=378.29999999999995s)]
*  Decorum. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=379.4s)]
*  I mean, Shannon Watts... [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=381.0s)]
*  Let's just go back to Decorum one second because you gave a very low answer at the beginning. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=381.29999999999995s)]
*  You just bypassed the Decorum. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=383.7s)]
*  You did bring up Decorum, civility in your original remarks. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=385.0s)]
*  Shannon Watts, who is a gun control activist. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  You may know her founder of Moms Demand Action. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  She had this viral post. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=391.4s)]
*  She said, democracy dies in Decorum. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=392.4s)]
*  Kind of riff on the post. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=394.5s)]
*  Democracy dies in darkness. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=395.7s)]
*  She's right, isn't she? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=397.09999999999997s)]
*  Democracy is on the line and people like you are talking about Decorum. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=398.29999999999995s)]
*  I think there's a lot of ways to fight righteous battles. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=402.0s)]
*  Think of the Civil Rights Movement. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  Malcolm X was part of that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=409.7s)]
*  Stokely Carmichael, fairly radical, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Martin Luther King, criticized by radicals for being way too accommodating and moderate. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=414.79999999999995s)]
*  You know who else was important? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=418.9s)]
*  John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  I think it's a mistake to get into the question of do you want to be John F. Kennedy or do you want to be Malcolm X? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  All of those elements are really important. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  But I am going to and I'm going to acknowledge that focusing on Decorum is the wrong thing to do. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=430.8s)]
*  I probably should have said the rules and I'm going to acknowledge that rules and laws are different. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=435.0s)]
*  But they are alike in the way that if we are to live in a society of laws and rules, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=439.5s)]
*  we have to take off the table that I can break a rule or a law simply because I have strong conviction. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=446.70000000000005s)]
*  This is why a young man murders the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=454.3s)]
*  He had strong conviction. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=458.0s)]
*  This is why, to bring up another potentially sore topic, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=459.6s)]
*  too many people seek to justify the extremely aggressive, brutal war on Gaza [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=463.3s)]
*  because of the horridness of the murder of 1200 Israelis. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=472.40000000000003s)]
*  Those are killings and crimes we can disagree. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=476.7s)]
*  Al Green saying the president has no mandate is not in the same moral or political universe. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=479.0s)]
*  You see, you're lawyering me here because it's not what he said that matters. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=484.8s)]
*  He took a decision consciously to break a rule. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=488.09999999999997s)]
*  And of course, I'm not going to say that that's the same as a law against murder. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=491.59999999999997s)]
*  You say you voted against Joe Wilson, to censure Joe Wilson. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=494.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=497.2s)]
*  That was what, 15 years ago. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  In the last three years, we had Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert repeatedly, abusively interrupt the president. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=499.8s)]
*  Did you vote to censure them? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=505.2s)]
*  So, the censure votes have not been about behavior. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  They've been about speech. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=511.0s)]
*  They went after Adam Schiff. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=511.9s)]
*  They went after Rashida Tlaib. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=513.2s)]
*  They went after, I think, Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=514.9s)]
*  Like for like, Marjorie Taylor Greene stood up and screamed at Biden in a way that Al Green did not do. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=516.7s)]
*  That's not why she was called to censure. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=520.8s)]
*  That's what I'm asking. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=523.0s)]
*  Did you censure her for what she did at a State of the Union? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=523.6s)]
*  Aren't we outraged? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=526.2s)]
*  Well, so remember, a lot of people are upset about the double standard. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=527.4s)]
*  An elderly black man is removed from the House and censured. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=530.0s)]
*  Two white Republican women abuse Biden in a way that Al Green did not do to Trump. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=533.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=538.0s)]
*  And they did not get censured. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  And I watched there through this speech as Marjorie Taylor Greene wore her hat. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=539.0s)]
*  That's a violation of the rules. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=543.0s)]
*  And the speaker didn't do anything about that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=544.5s)]
*  Now, we both feel outrage. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  Outrage that Marjorie Taylor Greene was not held to account by the speaker who held Al Green to account. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=549.5999999999999s)]
*  Why do we feel outrage? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=555.6999999999999s)]
*  Because they refuse to police our own. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  And it therefore follows logically, correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=560.0999999999999s)]
*  that we should celebrate the fact that we are willing to police our own. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=563.7s)]
*  No, I think the argument from a lot of people who are upset with you is that Democrats cannot continue fighting in this way. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=568.1s)]
*  It's as if you're playing football. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=573.9000000000001s)]
*  And when I say football, I'm being British soccer. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  And you're playing two teams and the other team keeps picking up the ball and running with it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=578.1s)]
*  And you insist we will carry on dribbling. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=581.7s)]
*  You will lose in every occasion. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=583.6s)]
*  At some point, you have to adapt to your circumstances. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=585.1s)]
*  Yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you celebrate the breaking of rules and laws. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=587.7s)]
*  So what do we do? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=593.7s)]
*  Not celebrate, it's just the vast majority of your colleagues did not vote to censure Al Green. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=594.5s)]
*  You did. You didn't have to censure him. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=598.5s)]
*  You could have said, I wouldn't have done it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=600.1s)]
*  But you didn't have to vote to censure him with all those Republicans, all those authoritarians, all those maga cultists. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=601.3000000000001s)]
*  I believe that when it comes to rules and law, context matter a little bit, but not a lot. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=606.2s)]
*  Again, how do I answer somebody who says you voted to condemn Joe Wilson, but not Al Green? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=614.1s)]
*  Law, you believe that the rules don't apply to your side. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=619.1s)]
*  That would certainly be the common person's understanding of this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=622.5s)]
*  And there's not a terrible answer to that. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=625.5s)]
*  I think you have a good answer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=628.0s)]
*  I think you yourself have given the answer in the past. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=629.1s)]
*  Let me read. I went through your Twitter for the last year. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=631.5s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=634.0s)]
*  Here's what you've been saying about Donald Trump. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=634.7s)]
*  You said he's betrayed our democracy. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=636.6s)]
*  He's taking us into a constitutional crisis. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=638.7s)]
*  He is, quote, breaking our democracy. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=641.0s)]
*  He is dismembering our democracy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=642.9s)]
*  These are all your words about what Trump is doing. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=644.5s)]
*  I don't think anyone thinks Barack Obama was doing that. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=647.1999999999999s)]
*  George Bush, I have many criticisms. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=649.6s)]
*  I think he's committed war crimes in Iraq, but I don't think he was trying to dismember American democracy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=651.0s)]
*  Trump is sui generis. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=655.0s)]
*  I think that is your argument that you can make to the imaginary person who says, why did you do that? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=656.3s)]
*  But not this. You yourself have admitted that he is betraying our democracy, dismembering our democracy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=660.0s)]
*  If he's dismembering our democracy, then why on earth are you worried about the rules of what you do in the middle of his speech? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=666.0s)]
*  A speech, by the way, in which he's insulting you to your face. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=672.2s)]
*  He's calling you radical left lunatics. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=674.9000000000001s)]
*  He's making racist jibes about Elizabeth Warren. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=676.8000000000001s)]
*  You want to talk about politics. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=679.3000000000001s)]
*  You guys look weak. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=680.5s)]
*  The guy's bullying you and you're all just sitting there quietly. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=681.7s)]
*  Al Green looks strong. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=683.8000000000001s)]
*  So let's stay on the question that you asked, because I would I agree with that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=684.9000000000001s)]
*  I don't think anybody thought that the collective response at that speech was a good one. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=688.5s)]
*  That's a different issue. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=692.7s)]
*  But there are two answers to your question. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=694.5s)]
*  Number one, we will cherish the rules more than they do because we are better than they are. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  And that matters. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=703.1s)]
*  Every social movement in history that has actually achieved its ends has held themselves to a higher standard. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  Anti-apartheid, civil rights, you name it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=708.9000000000001s)]
*  We hold ourselves to a higher standard. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=711.7s)]
*  That is our core strength. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=713.7s)]
*  They broke the rules. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=714.8000000000001s)]
*  Of course they broke the rules. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=715.5s)]
*  Of course they broke the rules. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=717.0s)]
*  We had this conversation and you accept the circumstances. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=717.9000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=721.8000000000001s)]
*  You asked me a series of questions. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=722.6s)]
*  I'm I you read my tweets. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=723.8000000000001s)]
*  I am not at all confused about how dire the threat of Donald Trump is. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=725.7s)]
*  Which is why I don't get the disconnect. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=729.7s)]
*  Medi, our health care system in this country is probably responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=730.9s)]
*  Deaths. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=736.3000000000001s)]
*  You could even characterize our health insurance system as murderous because of that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=736.7s)]
*  People are denied care. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=740.8000000000001s)]
*  Why should I object to the young man who decided that he would break the law against murder to kill a health care executive? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=742.5s)]
*  Answer that question for me. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=751.3000000000001s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=751.9s)]
*  A, it's against the law. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=752.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=754.0s)]
*  B, murder is always morally wrong. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=754.4s)]
*  I don't think standing up to heckle a president who is trying to dismantle democracy calls himself a king, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=756.6s)]
*  engages in white supremacist rhetoric, is targeting the media, is targeting political opponents and mocking you all in the process. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=762.1s)]
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with that. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=768.4s)]
*  That's not the I don't there's no it's nowhere near the same thing as murdering a health care executive. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=769.4s)]
*  Well, but they're on a spectrum here. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=774.5s)]
*  You're making the argument that some rules are stronger and more compelling than others. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=776.0s)]
*  Do not murder is not the same thing as do not stand up and object to a man that you and I both think is a threat to democracy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=782.2s)]
*  We agree on that, right? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=789.5s)]
*  We agree that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=790.5s)]
*  But do you agree that all rules that are not obviously unjust and the rule of House decorum or whatever it is, is not obviously unjust, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=792.5s)]
*  that all rules that are agreed upon by both sides or whatever. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=799.1s)]
*  I'm not even objecting to the century. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  Like you said, the rule was broken century. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm objecting to what I'm objecting to and what a lot of activists are doing is that you didn't need to vote for it. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  The ten of you did that right for some positioning or to send a message that we are, you know, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=810.0s)]
*  we believe in decorum and that's what's bothered. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=815.6s)]
*  Not that we believe in decorum, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=817.7s)]
*  but that we believe in the rules and that we seek to establish a dramatic difference between the Republicans who will move in lockstep, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=818.9s)]
*  not hold their own people, but that we think and that we take the claims of rules seriously. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=826.0s)]
*  I think Al Green established the dramatic difference in showing that he's got some kind of energy in him. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=830.7s)]
*  And you've even lost Bill Kristol on this lifelong neoconservative supporter of centrist Democrats. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=834.8s)]
*  He came out in favor of Al Green. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=839.9s)]
*  He wrote, am I alone in feeling that it was good to see some fervent conviction and righteous indignation? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=841.1999999999999s)]
*  Am I the only person who was actually kind of happy to see in a sea of Democrats waving little paddles with lame messages, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  someone literally standing up to Trump? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=853.5s)]
*  He's right, isn't he? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=856.3s)]
*  He's right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=857.4s)]
*  But you're now making a different argument. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  I think I started this conversation by saying, I think I even support what Al Green did. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=861.3s)]
*  The question is, was a censure right? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=867.0s)]
*  And was it right for me to participate? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=870.4s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=872.9s)]
*  So Bill Kristol didn't go on to say, and by the way, Al Green did not go on to say, please don't censure me. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=874.3s)]
*  In fact, he welcomed it. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=880.1s)]
*  From Republicans, not from his own colleagues. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=882.0s)]
*  Because he understands that civil disobedience. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=883.0s)]
*  I feel like you're trying to have your cake and eat it, Congressman. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=885.1s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=886.8s)]
*  So then why didn't you stand up? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=887.4s)]
*  Let's take your argument to it, Logical Green. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=888.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=890.4s)]
*  Why didn't you stand up, object to Trump in the same way, and then vote to censure yourself? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=890.9s)]
*  Well, that's why your argument's taking you. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=896.5s)]
*  That's a sophomoric argument. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=898.4s)]
*  I mean, I have thought a lot about how I could have done more. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=899.8s)]
*  And by the way, here's what I think driving the activist community. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=903.1s)]
*  It's not detailed arguments about the nature of civil disobedience. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=906.8s)]
*  There's an immense amount of fear out there that I share. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=910.7s)]
*  And by the way, I don't just share it. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=913.6s)]
*  I own it more than most because I was one of the last people out of the chamber when [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=915.4s)]
*  Donald Trump sent a murderous crowd to end the Congress and to kill us. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=918.7s)]
*  So I will give up nothing to nobody on the issue of understanding the fear. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=923.5s)]
*  And I will fight that tooth and nail, as I always have. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=927.6s)]
*  I did this for four years of Trump. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=930.5s)]
*  I participated in the investigation that led to his... [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=932.0s)]
*  So I get it. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=935.4s)]
*  But I am going to continue to pound the table on the point of both as a matter of ethics [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=936.6s)]
*  and maybe even more importantly, dare I say, politics. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=941.8s)]
*  Because in the activist community, there is a little bit of an instinct of everybody [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=946.1999999999999s)]
*  should do everything all the time, everywhere. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=950.1999999999999s)]
*  And when you're sitting in Westport, Connecticut, in your living room, you may feel that way. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=952.6s)]
*  But the single biggest thing we are going to do in the next year and a half to stop [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=957.2s)]
*  this man is to win the majority in the House of Representatives. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=961.5s)]
*  That's going to happen in the districts, interestingly enough, in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=964.7s)]
*  upstate New York. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=969.5s)]
*  That's going to happen there. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=970.5s)]
*  And I would submit that rather than saying about the 10 who censured, burn them, look [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=971.8s)]
*  at the fact that nine of those 10, including me, have beaten Republicans in open races [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=977.96s)]
*  or are holding down districts. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=983.0600000000001s)]
*  You think that was part of the calculation? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=984.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=985.36s)]
*  I'm not going to speak for others. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=986.36s)]
*  But to me, that question that I thought I might be asked by an unaffiliated, non-political [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=987.36s)]
*  voter in the Hudson Valley, seven miles from my home, why did you vote to condemn Joe Wilson, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=992.08s)]
*  but you didn't do it with... [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=997.84s)]
*  I think my former colleague, Chris Hayes, who you know well, said it best. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=999.36s)]
*  I think if you're thinking about what an imaginary voter, swing voters, is going to tell you [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1002.1600000000001s)]
*  in 2026 about this now, this is we've forgotten. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1005.32s)]
*  It would be forgotten. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1008.5200000000001s)]
*  Look at what's happening. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1009.5200000000001s)]
*  The news moves every day. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1010.5200000000001s)]
*  I think you might have got praise for doing it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1011.5200000000001s)]
*  On the politics, though, you make a good point about the politics. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1013.2800000000001s)]
*  But here's the problem for your party. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1016.2s)]
*  Do you believe the Democrats have a clear and winning strategy for stopping Trump? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1017.9200000000001s)]
*  Because a poll last week found that a plural... [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1023.5s)]
*  I can't say the word. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1025.0s)]
*  A plurality of voters, 40%, said the Democratic Party does not have any strategy whatsoever [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1026.04s)]
*  for responding to Trump. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1031.3200000000002s)]
*  Only 10% think your party has a good, solid plan. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1032.32s)]
*  Start from where we started. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1036.9199999999998s)]
*  The American people in November took away almost all of our legislative tools. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1038.1399999999999s)]
*  Now that makes me very angry and it makes a lot of people very angry. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1042.84s)]
*  But let me say it again. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1045.6s)]
*  The American people took away all of our legislative tools. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1046.7s)]
*  So we have a limit to what we can do. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1051.6s)]
*  We do not have a House majority. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1053.24s)]
*  We better win it. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1054.4199999999998s)]
*  So do we have a plan? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1055.4199999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1056.76s)]
*  I think we have to oppose in every moment, as you will see in the vote today, with unanimity, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1057.92s)]
*  to oppose the legislative initiatives of this president, of these god-awful attempts to [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1062.76s)]
*  slash Medicaid. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  It means to support the courts, which are actually the one branch of government that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1068.16s)]
*  is standing up to Donald Trump right now, in every way that we can. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1071.08s)]
*  I think I've signed three or four amicus briefs to the court. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1073.8799999999999s)]
*  And it means to work on public sentiment. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1076.62s)]
*  Now the public sentiment piece is where it gets really interesting. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1078.8s)]
*  Because again, there's a sentiment out there in the activist community that do everything [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1081.68s)]
*  all the time everywhere. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1085.52s)]
*  No, for god's sakes, focus on the economic devastation that this president is wreaking. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1086.68s)]
*  I represent Fairfield County. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1093.44s)]
*  I am very careful about believing that I know what an unaffiliated voter in the Hudson Valley [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1095.44s)]
*  makes. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1100.16s)]
*  But I spend all of my time talking to Mary Gleason in Camp Paris, Pat Ryan, and other [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1101.16s)]
*  people who do represent these communities. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1105.16s)]
*  And they will tell you, stay focused on the kitchen table issues. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1107.46s)]
*  Don't do things that reinforce the notion that we are the party of chaos. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1111.16s)]
*  And anyway, I'm not going to try to channel them. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1116.72s)]
*  Well, the body of resistance. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1117.72s)]
*  Because I think there's been a bit of a rewriting of history. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1119.0400000000002s)]
*  In 2018, you flipped the house not just with kitchen table issues. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1120.76s)]
*  You flipped with a very anti-Trump campaign, which then led to impeachment, et cetera, et [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1123.64s)]
*  cetera. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1128.0s)]
*  I don't think it was just kitchen table issues when I hear that. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1129.0s)]
*  So it's not either or. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1130.5600000000002s)]
*  It's a question of what you really... [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1131.5600000000002s)]
*  But even on the kitchen table issues, how radical are you willing to be? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1132.5600000000002s)]
*  Chris Murphy, for example. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1135.44s)]
*  You mentioned you won your seat from a Republican. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  You were considered by many a centrist, a moderate in the party. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1139.2s)]
*  Chris Murphy, who was on this show not long ago, he has been saying, as you know, that [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1142.3600000000001s)]
*  Democrats need to get much more economically populist right now. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1146.04s)]
*  They need to disown neoliberalism. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1149.92s)]
*  Some of the Clinton era. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1152.0s)]
*  He sounds more and more like Bernie Sanders. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1153.0s)]
*  In fact, Senator Sanders is speaking to crowds in Kenosha, Wisconsin. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1154.8s)]
*  You mentioned Wisconsin. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1157.8s)]
*  He's getting tens of thousands of people attending to his events. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1158.8s)]
*  Why do you think it is that Bernie has the appeal to a lot of people, even in these Republican [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1161.68s)]
*  that a lot of your other colleagues don't have? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1167.64s)]
*  Is it because he is willing to speak in much more blunt terms about the economy? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1169.28s)]
*  And there is no disagreement whatsoever between Chris's focus on the economic issues and my, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1172.68s)]
*  what I just said to you, which is we must focus not to the exclusion of other things, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1178.08s)]
*  but really center economic issues. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1182.06s)]
*  How does Boris Johnson win a stomping majority in the House of Commons, including winning [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1184.94s)]
*  seats in places where Margaret Thatcher is considered the devil herself? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1190.16s)]
*  He does it, and this is the winning formula, by leaning left economically, you will find [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1194.94s)]
*  that there are blue dogs and new Democrats and progressives who agree we need to raise [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1199.7s)]
*  the minimum wage, expand Medicaid, have a conversation. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1202.74s)]
*  I don't know that we have unanimity on Medicare for all. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1206.3000000000002s)]
*  But I think you will find great unity around the mission of a lefty economic message. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1208.76s)]
*  And what does Boris Johnson do? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1213.5800000000002s)]
*  He has a right-leaning cultural message, patriotic. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1214.66s)]
*  And what happens in Britain doesn't perfectly translate. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1218.7800000000002s)]
*  What do you think the Democrats' right-leaning message should be? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1220.9s)]
*  So I think we should center the economic issues that I think were a big piece of us losing [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1223.74s)]
*  in the last election and tread very carefully on, let me use the word exotic, issues that [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1231.1s)]
*  are new to the American public. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1236.86s)]
*  I'm thinking about it. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1238.34s)]
*  And by the way, controversial, right? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1239.34s)]
*  Minors with, you know, receiving transgender surgery. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1242.66s)]
*  There are thoughts on both sides of that issue. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1246.44s)]
*  It is not a particularly salient issue for lots of people. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1249.34s)]
*  I can give you other examples. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1252.3s)]
*  The argument would be it's not a salient issue, but the Republicans have weaponized it into [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1253.86s)]
*  a salient issue, but the Democrats shouldn't go along with that. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1257.86s)]
*  Don't help them do that. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1260.3s)]
*  Don't help them do that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1262.18s)]
*  And some might say you sound like you're helping them do that by saying we should stay away [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1263.18s)]
*  from it. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1266.8999999999999s)]
*  The activist base, we are still carrying the weight. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1267.8999999999999s)]
*  And let's set aside the substance of police violence and abuse. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1269.94s)]
*  I made my points very clearly on that. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1272.8999999999999s)]
*  We are still carrying the weight of defund the police around. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1275.1599999999999s)]
*  Now, by the way, almost no member of Congress said that. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1279.3799999999999s)]
*  It was a Republican talking point that you guys let them run without you. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1282.02s)]
*  And so we're just the passive victims of that fact? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1286.3799999999999s)]
*  Or can we stand up and say defunding the police is a bad idea that is opposed most intensely [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1288.54s)]
*  by African Americans? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1293.9s)]
*  It's actually not a bad idea when you explain it to people as about reallocating resources. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1296.3s)]
*  But my point being is I do think that people on your wing of the party have hidden behind [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1299.9s)]
*  that rather than look at other issues that cost you seats, cost you votes. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1303.9s)]
*  Defund the police was not the reason you lost the election last year. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1307.78s)]
*  No one was even running on it. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1309.98s)]
*  Joe Biden increased. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1310.98s)]
*  I was giving you an example. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1312.94s)]
*  The ad that ran, the tagline of which was she is for they, them and Donald Trump is [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1313.94s)]
*  for you. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1319.18s)]
*  Yes, the Republicans are very proud of that ad. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1320.18s)]
*  Well, and you know, the research shows that it swung some people. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1321.18s)]
*  And by the way, I'm not saying throw transgender Americans overboard. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1324.78s)]
*  I'm just saying you can choose to focus on certain things and to not focus on other things. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1327.9s)]
*  And we get that perpetually wrong in this party. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1333.18s)]
*  Your colleague, Pramila Jayapal, was on a show with me recently and she said, we are [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1336.3s)]
*  leaderless in reference to your party. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1341.06s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1342.62s)]
*  I don't agree with that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1343.62s)]
*  No. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1344.62s)]
*  Who is the leader of the Democratic Party? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1345.62s)]
*  The leader of the Democratic Party in the House, of course, is Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1347.1s)]
*  And I think he's doing a good job. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1350.02s)]
*  I don't think that the way the response to the State of the Union played out was very [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1351.3s)]
*  good. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1354.82s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1355.82s)]
*  Because I sort of said, I think we need to highlight economic issues. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1356.82s)]
*  I also think we need to strive for unity. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1358.58s)]
*  Why do I not say we need to be unified? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1361.02s)]
*  Because we're Democrats. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1362.94s)]
*  It is very, very hard to get Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin on the same page. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1363.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1368.54s)]
*  I think we have real work to do. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1369.54s)]
*  Here's a thought. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1371.42s)]
*  You know, what would have, I've asked myself, what would have been more effective than this [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1372.42s)]
*  sort of chaotic, weird bunch of stuff that happened in the speech? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1375.1399999999999s)]
*  What if, for example, we had all stood as one when he attacked us and left? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1378.46s)]
*  And we would have said- [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1383.3s)]
*  Or what if you didn't show up in the first place? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1384.3s)]
*  As AOC didn't and some other- [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1385.3s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's more powerful if we say this is an affair of, this is my opinion, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1386.3s)]
*  there's lots of arguments. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1389.8999999999999s)]
*  My, to me, the most powerful statement would have been if we had shown up, shown the respect [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1391.1399999999999s)]
*  for the moment and for the office. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1395.1399999999999s)]
*  Remember, the military salutes the uniform, not the man. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1396.7s)]
*  And then when he attacked us in a brutal public, stand up as one and walk off. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1399.34s)]
*  To me, that would have been a response of both unity and power as opposed to fragmentation. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1403.72s)]
*  But you didn't do it. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1408.4199999999998s)]
*  We didn't do it. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1409.4199999999998s)]
*  Democrats, Democrats, don't do it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1410.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's easy to organize Democrats. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1411.4199999999998s)]
*  And you keep getting attacked. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1413.4199999999998s)]
*  You've got Elon Musk this week calling Senator Mark Kelly, U.S. Navy Gulf War veteran, decorated [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1414.62s)]
*  a traitor for going to Ukraine and saying America stands with Ukraine. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1421.4199999999998s)]
*  That is the language your opponents are using about you. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1425.6399999999999s)]
*  Treason. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1428.22s)]
*  Traitor. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1429.34s)]
*  And do you think that helps, do you think that helps or hurts us? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1430.34s)]
*  I think it hurts you if you don't push back against the bully. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1433.8600000000001s)]
*  This is the problem with the Democrats. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1436.26s)]
*  The public sees one side punching and the other side rolling over. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1437.46s)]
*  That's just, that's, I know that that's the catechism, but it's not true. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1440.6200000000001s)]
*  It's not the catechism. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1444.58s)]
*  I'm telling you what I see. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1445.58s)]
*  I'm telling you what I see. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1446.58s)]
*  I'm telling you what I do, okay? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1447.58s)]
*  You characterize me as a moderate. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1448.58s)]
*  There has not been a day in this administration when I haven't been on three media platforms. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1450.98s)]
*  Congressman, you're contradicting yourself. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1455.38s)]
*  30 seconds ago you said we should have walked out. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1456.98s)]
*  You didn't. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1459.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1460.02s)]
*  So you looked weak. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1461.02s)]
*  We agree you looked weak. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1462.02s)]
*  We absolutely looked weak. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1464.2s)]
*  Okay then. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1465.34s)]
*  Your question was. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1466.34s)]
*  So then what are you objecting to when I say that's not a catechism, but you and I agree. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1467.34s)]
*  You're moving all over the place right now. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1470.14s)]
*  The same position. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1471.14s)]
*  You guys look weak for not pushing back when they insult and attack you. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1472.14s)]
*  And that's the same point that we made. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1475.7s)]
*  And there has been immense pushback to Musk's statement that Mark Kelly is a traitor. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1476.7s)]
*  And by the way, I know how America feels. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1481.94s)]
*  I know how a veteran feels. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1483.8600000000001s)]
*  When a combat veteran like Mark Kelly has been called a traitor by a man who never served [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1485.82s)]
*  Elon Musk. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1490.6599999999999s)]
*  So the mere existence of that tweet helps us. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1491.6599999999999s)]
*  And I agree with you. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1494.3s)]
*  We should push back hard. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1495.34s)]
*  Go look at the comments. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1496.72s)]
*  Go look at the statements. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1497.78s)]
*  You will see that there is a strong pushback. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1498.78s)]
*  You talked about Trump being a threat to democracy. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1500.76s)]
*  Is Elon Musk a threat to American democracy? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1502.9199999999998s)]
*  He absolutely is. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1504.86s)]
*  I think if, I don't know what's inside his head, but a man who stands up and supports [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1505.86s)]
*  the AFD and who calls Mark Kelly a traitor is a very real threat. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1509.06s)]
*  I don't think Elon Musk has any sense for what democracy is. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1513.38s)]
*  What is going on with Musk, Trump and Putin? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1516.5400000000002s)]
*  Obviously in the Trump first term, Democrats, Russia was a huge issue. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1519.5s)]
*  There was an investigation. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1523.3000000000002s)]
*  Mueller, Trump came out claiming triumph. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1524.3000000000002s)]
*  He calls it Russia, gate Russia hoax, blah, blah, blah. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1526.74s)]
*  And yet the second time he's even more pro-Russian than the first time. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1529.18s)]
*  What is going on there with Trump, Musk and Putin in your view? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1531.7s)]
*  So this is the Chamberlain in Munich moment for the United States. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1535.22s)]
*  We have betrayed Ukraine. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1538.7600000000002s)]
*  We have stood with a totalitarian murderer and denigrated and weakened a struggling democracy. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1541.46s)]
*  It is Chamberlain in Munich and it is driven by Donald Trump and his internal belief that [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1548.28s)]
*  all that matters is strength. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1554.18s)]
*  He sees Putin as strong. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1555.44s)]
*  He admires his unfettered power. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1556.94s)]
*  He admires his wealth. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1559.06s)]
*  He sees Zelensky as weak. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1560.22s)]
*  We used to be a country. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1561.38s)]
*  We fall short of this many, many times, but we used to be a country that stood with struggling [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1562.66s)]
*  democracies against that sort of thing. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1566.9s)]
*  And by the way, Musk, who knows what happens inside that head, but there's very clearly [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1569.62s)]
*  pro-fascist instincts in that man. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1574.5s)]
*  Yeah, he speaks to Democrats, small D Democrats in a way. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1577.74s)]
*  I don't think he'd speak to Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1581.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1583.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, here's going to be one of the, if you believe my diagnosis of Donald [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1584.4199999999998s)]
*  Trump, that he just worships strength and power and wealth, what does that mean for [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1589.1s)]
*  Xi versus Taiwan? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1597.1s)]
*  I know who he's going to see as powerful in that context. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1599.02s)]
*  So this is going to have reverberations around the world. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1602.34s)]
*  How would you describe the modern Republican Party? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1605.26s)]
*  Well, it's utterly captured. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1607.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a cult today, right? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1608.58s)]
*  It is completely captured by one man, Donald Trump, who has taken the party 180 degrees [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1609.8999999999999s)]
*  from what this party used to believe, right? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1615.86s)]
*  Free trade, open immigration, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1617.6999999999998s)]
*  of personality where everyone, even you see brief flashes of concern from people like [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1621.56s)]
*  Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, but you had the Star Wars cantina of cabinet nominees, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1629.48s)]
*  none of whom faced any real opposition. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1638.08s)]
*  So it is an entirely captured party. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1640.02s)]
*  How would you describe the Democratic Party? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1641.82s)]
*  Because I'm saying you look weak and you mentioned the cantina of nominees. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1643.84s)]
*  A lot of those cabinet nominees got Democratic votes. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1648.28s)]
*  Just this week, the Labour secretary nominee got seven Democratic senators, including [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1650.92s)]
*  Slock, who responded to the speech. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1654.2s)]
*  The early ones did, right? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1656.6s)]
*  I mean, before the full… [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1657.92s)]
*  Marco Rubio got 99 votes. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1659.36s)]
*  Very early on, right? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1661.2s)]
*  A lot of these votes, you'd have to ask the senators this, but my belief is that a lot [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1662.52s)]
*  of senators, if they knew now what they didn't know… [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1665.96s)]
*  Some of us knew then. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1669.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know why you have to come late to the party. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1670.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you a very important question before we run out of time, and I appreciate you taking [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1673.28s)]
*  time out for this. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1675.56s)]
*  This Sunday, Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian grad student at Columbia, lawful permanent [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1676.56s)]
*  resident, green card holder, married to a US citizen, eight months pregnant, has armed [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1681.04s)]
*  federal agents turn up at his home, ICE agents, who claim his student visa is revoked. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1685.08s)]
*  He says, I have a green card. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1690.28s)]
*  They say, well, that's revoked as well. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1691.28s)]
*  They take him, detain him, disappear him. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1692.8999999999999s)]
*  We don't know on what charges. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1694.72s)]
*  The president comes out post saying he's pro-terrorist, anti-American. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1696.8s)]
*  Very McCarthy outphrase. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1701.8s)]
*  Not sure there's a law against being anti-American. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1703.1s)]
*  Because there will be more such arrests coming. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1704.96s)]
*  You have legal immigrants in this country, not just undocumented immigrants, now living [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1707.16s)]
*  in fear. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1710.94s)]
*  And we know that if you start with green card holders, there's no reason they won't continue [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1711.94s)]
*  to citizens. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1715.06s)]
*  New citizens, that's right. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1716.06s)]
*  Naturalized citizens, people we've been talking about. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1717.06s)]
*  Is this what fascism looks like? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1719.38s)]
*  Yes, frankly. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1721.56s)]
*  I mean, again, I want to be careful about how I talk about this. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1724.4s)]
*  Fascism is a lot of things, but this is an element of totalitarianism, of fascism. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1729.1200000000001s)]
*  It's completely un-American and McCarthyite. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1734.56s)]
*  And so if we continue the conversation that we've been having, what do we do? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1737.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think you'll find earlier today, I put up a tweet about this. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1741.48s)]
*  Lots of other members have spoken out, raising hell. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1744.72s)]
*  We'll all be doing social media stuff to make this case, which is that there is no law against [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1747.04s)]
*  having an unpopular opinion. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1751.68s)]
*  In fact, in this country, we used to cherish the standing that you had to articulate an [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1753.04s)]
*  unpopular opinion. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1757.3200000000002s)]
*  So we'll be telling that case. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1758.68s)]
*  Will we be passing a law in the House of Representatives? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1759.94s)]
*  I'm sorry to say we will not. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1761.92s)]
*  Well, I've seen that 14 Democrats have signed the letter saying he should be immediately [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1763.48s)]
*  released. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1766.52s)]
*  Your name's not on that, but I assume you support the sentiment. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1767.52s)]
*  It will be. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1769.2s)]
*  You support the sentiment that he should be released unless he's charged, convicted, and [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1770.2s)]
*  then had a green card removed via a formal process, which exists. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1773.76s)]
*  I will sign every letter. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1776.96s)]
*  I will make every speech. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1777.96s)]
*  But remember the first thing I said here, which is that the American people chose to [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1779.0400000000002s)]
*  disarm us, to take away our tools. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1783.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm not blaming the American people. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1785.72s)]
*  No, no. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1787.0800000000002s)]
*  And one of the reasons... [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1788.0800000000002s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1789.0800000000002s)]
*  The place to look is the courts. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1790.48s)]
*  And so far, so far, we've been winning nine out of ten, maybe more, of the cases in the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1793.1599999999999s)]
*  courts. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1798.56s)]
*  So right now, I am ashamed of the fact that my party was taken out of contention by the [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1799.56s)]
*  American people on election day and that we therefore have very limited tools. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1803.36s)]
*  But I am proud of the fact that the judiciary, for the most part, has stood up and said, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1807.1999999999998s)]
*  you will not do these unconstitutional things. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1811.8799999999999s)]
*  It's interesting that you mentioned a moment ago about losing and why you lost and removing [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1814.36s)]
*  your tools. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1818.76s)]
*  Just before we finish, since we're on the subject of Mahmoud Khalil, one of the reasons [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1819.76s)]
*  you lost your tools, according to polls that have been done, is that a lot of swing voters [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1822.48s)]
*  and a lot of voters who voted for Biden in 2020 but didn't show up for Kamala Harris [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1826.48s)]
*  in 2024, Gaza was one of their top issues for a lot, especially a lot of young voters [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1830.1200000000001s)]
*  who objected to the fact that Joe Biden refused to disown Netanyahu. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1834.44s)]
*  You guys refused to stop sending weapons to a government that was being investigated at [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1839.28s)]
*  the ICJ and the ICC. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1842.4s)]
*  Do you accept that defund the police and transgender issue that Republicans weaponized, but Gaza [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1844.0s)]
*  was also a big issue lost last year as well? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know that there's evidence that there's a big issue with respect to the... [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1852.56s)]
*  Bigger than defund the police? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1855.64s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1856.64s)]
*  And there's a time difference there too. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1857.64s)]
*  But there's polling that shows one of the top issues for people who voted Biden in 2020 [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1858.64s)]
*  but not 2024. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  I think it's you guys polling Gaza was one of the top issues. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1864.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  And I think we probably lost Gaza on both sides. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that we lost a number of Jewish voters and we lost people who were... [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1868.8s)]
*  We lost a lot more on people who were upset about the genocide. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1872.72s)]
*  But fine. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1875.72s)]
*  I'm not sure that there's an obvious answer to that question, but I am sure about one [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1876.72s)]
*  thing and we've been slagging the Democratic Party pretty hard right now, but I am sure [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1880.1200000000001s)]
*  about one thing. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1883.4s)]
*  The Republican Party is not interested in the conversation. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1884.5600000000002s)]
*  Israel, right or wrong, ethics be damned. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1887.4s)]
*  In the Democratic Party, we will grapple with the standing and the arguments and the moral [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1889.96s)]
*  stance of Israel even as we grapple with the moral claims of the Palestinian people. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1895.0800000000002s)]
*  That makes me proud. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1900.28s)]
*  I don't want to be part of the other party, including the complete dispensation of rules [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1901.48s)]
*  and laws. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1907.92s)]
*  I don't want to be that party. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1908.92s)]
*  I want to be the party that considers these things, that grapples with these things. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1909.92s)]
*  Forget about decorum, but that has a certain respect for the rules. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1913.04s)]
*  That's the party I want to be part of. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1916.6000000000001s)]
*  Congressman Jim Himes of Connecticut, thank you for your time. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1918.16s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCZsAF1ws3s&t=1920.1200000000001s)]
