Video Description: “They [conservatives] are weaponizing celebrity gossip and weaponizing pop culture stories to push conservative narratives and ultimately mainstream their ideology. And liberals are so incredibly out of touch with culture that they haven't even picked up on it.”

Journalist and *Zeteo* contributor Taylor Lorenz joins Mehdi Hasan on 'Mehdi Unfiltered' to discuss how conservative influencers like Candace Owens and journalists like Megyn Kelly are using pop culture to radicalize women into a right-wing political agenda, further pushing misogyny and MAGA ideologies.

# Blake Lively vs. Justin Baldoni: How MAGA Took Over Pop Culture Discourse
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4)
*  If you've been on the internet in the last six months, you've probably heard all about it by now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=0.0s)]
*  The scandal behind what was supposed to be a box office smash hit. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=4.2s)]
*  Yes, I'm talking about the Blake Lively vs. Justin Boldoni legal drama. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=7.96s)]
*  In December, Lively filed a legal complaint against Boldoni, her co-star in the movie. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=12.24s)]
*  It ends with us accusing him of both sexual harassment and of launching a smear campaign against her. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=16.48s)]
*  He denies it all and he's filed a countersuit against her. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=21.84s)]
*  But regardless of who you think is right or wrong or who you think is going to triumph in court, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=25.0s)]
*  behind all the scandal and gossip, there is perhaps something even more sinister. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=29.48s)]
*  It's a phenomenon that's been called the misogyny slop ecosystem, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=33.6s)]
*  which could be responsible for funneling some women into the far-right media machine. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=37.6s)]
*  The alt-right pipeline is constantly evolving and taking new forms, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=41.92s)]
*  covering almost every corner of the internet. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=45.6s)]
*  And while we mostly associate it with, say, video games, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=47.92s)]
*  the far-right has been able to capture a growing share of women in pop culture discourse videos, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=51.08s)]
*  most recently and most notably the Justin Boldoni Blake Lively drama. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=56.36s)]
*  Here to break it all down for us is Taylor Lorenz, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=60.36s)]
*  the award-winning tech and culture journalist behind User Mag, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=62.36s)]
*  and recently the new Zateo column, Network Effect. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=65.32s)]
*  Taylor, welcome to May the Unfiltered. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=68.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=70.4s)]
*  It was a great piece that you wrote that we also republished on all of this. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=71.84s)]
*  But just break it down for the few people who haven't read it yet. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=76.08s)]
*  What exactly is the misogyny slop ecosystem? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=79.44s)]
*  Who's behind it? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=83.4s)]
*  How does it work as a pipeline? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so the term was coined by this YouTuber, Ophidoki, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=87.44s)]
*  who's a feminist YouTuber and did a great job kind of articulating this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=91.16s)]
*  It's basically this broad ecosystem of accounts, including right-wing influencers, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=94.2s)]
*  but also people like LawTube, the True Crime World, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=98.76s)]
*  all of these different factions of the internet that sort of thrive and monetize [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  and make a living by creating content, attacking women, smearing women, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=107.68s)]
*  and casting doubt on any woman that comes forward with allegations of sexual assault [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=111.76s)]
*  in Amber Heard's case, sexual harassment in Blake Lively's case. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=117.76s)]
*  Any woman that is challenging power or involved in sort of the broader [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=121.32s)]
*  women's rights movement is targeted in these ways. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=125.52s)]
*  And basically, there is just a tsunami of content made about them, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=130.16s)]
*  where they just overwhelm YouTube primarily and social media with. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=135.68s)]
*  One of those people, as you identify in your piece, is Candice Owens, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=139.32s)]
*  who you and I both know as a far-right political commentator, trumper. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=142.32s)]
*  She's been a huge name in the online and YouTube coverage of the Baldoni Lively drama. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=146.2s)]
*  I think she even got cited by one of the Lively legal team members. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=150.2s)]
*  Do most people even know her political leanings? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=154.68s)]
*  I think about a lot of people who don't follow politics like you and I do, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=157.8s)]
*  who, like a good celeb story, come across her video on YouTube because of the algorithms, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=161.08s)]
*  and either they don't know about her politics or they don't care because she's covering pop culture. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  But before they know it, they've gone down a Candice Owens black hole. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly what's happening. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=174.84s)]
*  So Candice Owens is absolutely dominating the coverage. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=176.16s)]
*  She's done nonstop live streams, videos, just feeding this hunger for news. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=178.84s)]
*  I mean, this is one of the biggest popular stories. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  Anti-Lively stuff, right? Just to be clear, anti-Lively. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=187.88s)]
*  Anti-Blake Lively stuff, yes, exactly. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=189.2s)]
*  So, you know, I think so many women especially are fascinated by this case, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=191.12s)]
*  are interested in it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Pop culture news is huge with women. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  And so you have the right-wing influencers recognizing that and doing audience capture [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=199.32s)]
*  and doing nonstop coverage of the Lively suit. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  It's not just Candice Owens. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  It's also, you know, Brett Cooper or Megyn Kelly, who gave her talk at CPAC about this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=207.72s)]
*  The problem is, is that the women that are watching this stuff, they're just going on YouTube. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  They're searching for content because they want to keep up with this case. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=216.72s)]
*  They want to know every new detail. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=219.44s)]
*  And the only people acknowledging it and covering it are these right-wing accounts. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  And so they don't realize it and they start watching it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=225.48s)]
*  And then suddenly, you know, they keep watching Candice Owens [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=227.16s)]
*  and then they're exposed to all of this other really dangerous content. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=230.2s)]
*  Like she's currently trying to rehabilitate Harvey Weinstein. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  Is it a deliberate strategy for people on the right? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=237.0s)]
*  Because it's clearly working. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=239.28s)]
*  I know people in, friends of mine, family members, people who are not, as I say, into politics. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  And they will cite stuff to me from a Megyn Kelly or a Candice Owens or a Charlie Kirk even. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=244.76s)]
*  And I'll say, do you know their backgrounds? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=249.88s)]
*  And then they're horrified to find out, oh, they're Trump supporters. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=251.64s)]
*  Or they believe this about Muslims or immigrants. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  But they haven't come through that prison, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=256.44s)]
*  They've come through a different pipeline, to use your line. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=258.88s)]
*  People know that Fox is right-wing, right? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=262.92s)]
*  People know, OK, Fox News right-wing. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=264.64s)]
*  It's coded, right? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=266.6s)]
*  But when some of this pop cultural stuff comes up on YouTube, it's not obviously coded. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=267.8s)]
*  And I'm wondering, are the right-wingers, this is a deliberate strategy on their part in your perspective? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=271.68s)]
*  Yeah, I spoke to a bunch of these right-wing influencers. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=277.2s)]
*  And then I also sort of analyzed a bunch of channels that are not directly right-wing. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=280.12s)]
*  But basically, because the right-wing influencers are dominating the discourse around this [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  and really setting the tone on the coverage and setting the narratives, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=289.24s)]
*  that ends up trickling down all through YouTube. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=292.12s)]
*  And drama channels and tea channels just repeat the right-wing framing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=294.08s)]
*  And subscribe now. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=310.12s)]
*  You'll be supporting fearless, independent journalism. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=311.28s)]
*  And when I was talking to a lot of these right-wing influencers, they talked about pop culture. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=314.0s)]
*  I mean, Brett Cooper was saying, you know, look, she's a former actress. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=318.0s)]
*  You know, Ben Shapiro is a theatre nerd. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=322.0s)]
*  That's why he does these viral reviews of Wicked and the Barbie movie. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  But one thing that Brett, who's a right-wing YouTuber who recently left The Daily Wire, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=328.64s)]
*  told me is like, they're not the old conservatives. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=332.76s)]
*  People like Rush Limbaugh, this older generation, they kind of shunned Hollywood. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=335.36s)]
*  They didn't like this fame ecosystem. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=339.84s)]
*  This younger generation is conservatives. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=341.48s)]
*  A lot of them have come from Hollywood. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  They're failed actors, failed actresses. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=345.2s)]
*  And they go into the right-wing media because, you know, they can be cast in right-wing movies. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=347.28s)]
*  Michael Knowles from The Daily Wire, I think, is a failed actor, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=350.68s)]
*  He's one of them. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  So many of them are. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=354.52s)]
*  And I think Ben Shapiro originally wanted to be a screenwriter. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=356.12s)]
*  And so they are all like theatre kids and fascinated with pop culture. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=359.24s)]
*  And they've recognized that if they want to reach young people and be culturally relevant, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=363.04s)]
*  they've got to tap into these major cultural stories. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=367.32s)]
*  So given that, why have liberals, Taylor, been so useless at capturing some of the online attention [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=369.76s)]
*  for Hollywood stories, where liberals have traditionally been dominant? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=376.88s)]
*  So I think liberals are traditionally, quote unquote, dominant in maybe old school Hollywood, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=380.88s)]
*  but certainly not in celebrity news. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=386.44s)]
*  When you look at celebrity news, it's always leaned a little bit conservative. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=388.12s)]
*  It's been dominated by tabloid culture, which is often centered around shaming women, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=390.96s)]
*  casting doubt on allegations, things like that. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  And liberals generally, they just have no clue about culture. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=398.76s)]
*  I mean, look at the influencers that liberals are working with. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=402.36s)]
*  They're just working with these centrist neoliberal Democrat influencers that are not doing anything to broaden their base. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  And when I talk to a lot of liberals about this, even big liberal influencers, and said, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=410.44s)]
*  why aren't you covering this? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=414.08000000000004s)]
*  They're just smug. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=415.68s)]
*  They dismiss it as celebrity news. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=416.76s)]
*  And I think they don't take things like misogyny seriously, because this is not just celebrity news. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=418.36s)]
*  This is a vehicle for dismantling Me Too. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=422.36s)]
*  That's what it is, to be clear. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=424.84s)]
*  This is not like, oh, some celebrity gossip. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  They are weaponizing celebrity gossip and weaponizing pop culture stories to push conservative narratives [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=428.84s)]
*  and ultimately mainstream their ideology. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  And liberals are so incredibly out of touch with culture that they haven't even picked up on it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=437.32s)]
*  Well, we at Zateo are taking it seriously, which is why we made you a contributor and republished your piece, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=442.96s)]
*  and are having this discussion. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=446.84s)]
*  Let me ask you, you talked about Me Too. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=448.2s)]
*  How much is this driven just by online hate against women? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=450.12s)]
*  As you mentioned at the start, there's Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=453.56s)]
*  Now it's Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=456.28s)]
*  How much of it is it just an excuse to bash women? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=458.0s)]
*  So much of it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=461.32s)]
*  I mean, this whole anti-woman movement has its roots in Gamergate. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  It was really, I think that this playbook was solidified in terms of with Amber Heard in that case, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=466.28s)]
*  in the smear campaign that was run against her. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=472.4s)]
*  You see similar smear campaigns against people like Meghan Markle. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=474.59999999999997s)]
*  We just need to recognize this for what it is. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=478.12s)]
*  I get that not everyone is going to follow every single update in the Baldoni vs Lively trial, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=481.76s)]
*  but I think when you zoom out and you look at it, just say, listen, we should believe women. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=487.2s)]
*  This woman came forward with a credible allegation of sexual harassment. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=492.8s)]
*  She does not deserve then to be subject to this coordinated smear campaign. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=496.8s)]
*  And it is coordinated, allegedly, because Baldoni has hired literally the same comms firms. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=500.12s)]
*  There's the same people that were involved with the Amber Heard smear campaign. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  So it's just so transparent. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=509.24s)]
*  On the note about the kind of believe women and women coming forward, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=511.08s)]
*  isn't part of your argument in the piece you wrote that actually what this online phenomenon has done so effectively [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=514.96s)]
*  is it's brought women into the online anti-women campaign. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=522.72s)]
*  So I remember during the Johnny Depp Amber Heard case, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=525.92s)]
*  it was a bunch of women in my extended family who were defending Johnny Depp. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=529.4s)]
*  Because it's radicalizing women. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=534.64s)]
*  And I think there's been such an obsession with talking about the right wing pipeline for men, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=536.56s)]
*  as there should be, right? That's a really serious problem. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=541.92s)]
*  We have the brocasters and all that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=544.64s)]
*  But the left and liberals have completely ignored this misogyny pipeline, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=546.68s)]
*  and they've completely ignored the way that women have been radicalized. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=551.84s)]
*  And let me tell you, women are being radicalized. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=555.52s)]
*  I mean, there are so many women that are now listening to Candace Owens. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=557.68s)]
*  Candace Owens said that her audience has skyrocketed off of this, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=561.4s)]
*  and she's leaning further into pop culture coverage. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=564.48s)]
*  And so when you go to look for pop culture news, your options are sort of tabloid news, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=567.2s)]
*  which is inherently usually misogynistic, the entire right wing media ecosystem [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=572.48s)]
*  and right wing YouTube channels or channels that repeat those narratives. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  And that's it. The left and liberals have completely just left pop culture. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=580.32s)]
*  You know, they're just ignoring pop culture. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=584.8800000000001s)]
*  And I think it's really damaging. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=586.6400000000001s)]
*  Candace Owens, who thinks the First Lady of France is a secret man [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=590.4s)]
*  and is an anti-vaxxer, is now having all this influence. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=594.32s)]
*  Great. We're not screwed at all as a country. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  One last question. You mentioned a coordinated smear campaign, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=599.16s)]
*  which, of course, Justin Baldoni denies. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=602.28s)]
*  There was this big investigation into the Lively lawsuit by the New York Times [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=604.32s)]
*  in December in which the Times said they had obtained private messages [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=608.84s)]
*  detailing an alleged campaign by Baldoni's PR people to quote, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=612.16s)]
*  bury and smear lively. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=615.44s)]
*  Now, Baldoni's people deny that. He's suing the Times, in fact, over that piece. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=617.6800000000001s)]
*  But I wonder, in a more broader sense, are most people aware of the way, do you think, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=621.5200000000001s)]
*  in which mainstream media coverage, we're skeptical of social media, right? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=626.6800000000001s)]
*  We're like, oh, we can't believe everything you read on the internet. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=630.0s)]
*  But can you believe everything you read in the New York Times or the Daily Mail [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=631.96s)]
*  or the Washington Post or the Times of London? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  A lot of those pieces, especially when it comes to pop culture, are curated, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=637.08s)]
*  are shaped by PR people behind the scenes. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=641.36s)]
*  We're very familiar with the effect of, like, the oil lobby on climate stories [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=643.68s)]
*  or the Israel lobby on Middle East stories. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=647.28s)]
*  But there is a Hollywood lobby of various types shaping a lot of the news coverage [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=649.36s)]
*  of these stories, too, which we're just not aware of. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=653.4s)]
*  Absolutely. And I'm not saying that, you know, you should take everything [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=655.88s)]
*  that you ever read from these mainstream media outlets as Bible or truth, right? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=659.12s)]
*  And I think what's a really good point in that story that stood out to me [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=663.96s)]
*  is there's this quote from one of the comms people that's like, wow, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=666.72s)]
*  people are so eager to smear women. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=668.88s)]
*  And I think that's what Baldoni argues is like, look, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=671.24s)]
*  I tried, I think he kind of, you know, he hired these comms people. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=673.24s)]
*  But ultimately, this is a product of the Internet and algorithmic feeds [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=676.0s)]
*  and short form monetization and all of these much bigger problems. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=679.72s)]
*  Even if Baldoni sat back and did nothing, you know, I would argue [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=682.6800000000001s)]
*  he should be out there proactively squashing this misogynistic hate campaign. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=686.48s)]
*  But of course, he's not doing that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=689.72s)]
*  You know, it has a life of its own and people are going to take up these causes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=691.6s)]
*  Right. People are going to just so people are going to run with it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=695.64s)]
*  So how do we combat it, Taylor, dare I ask? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=698.36s)]
*  We can't just switch off the algorithms. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  No, I think we need liberals to wake up and start being culturally relevant. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=702.88s)]
*  Stop dismissing, stop getting on your high horse and dismissing everything [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=708.8s)]
*  is celebrity gossip, not engaging with the reality TV ecosystem, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=712.32s)]
*  not engaging in the celebrity news ecosystem. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=715.76s)]
*  These are major cultural, like culturally important spaces, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=717.92s)]
*  whether you think they're high minded or not. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=721.4399999999999s)]
*  This is what a lot of women, especially young women, are listening to [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=722.76s)]
*  and engaging with. And this is the news they want, just the way that a lot of men [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=726.16s)]
*  are listening to sports and bodybuilding content and whatever. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=729.12s)]
*  And not to say the women aren't, too, but you know what I mean? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=732.5600000000001s)]
*  There's these like female dominated spaces that have been completely abdicated [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=734.36s)]
*  by liberals. Yes. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=738.6s)]
*  And I think there's a broader point there for all of us, which is across the board. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=740.12s)]
*  Online spaces have been abdicated by liberal left. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=743.84s)]
*  We saw that in the election and that has to change ASAP. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=746.12s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pZfRosiAf4&t=749.0400000000001s)]
