Video Description: Watch Senator Tina Smith join Mehdi Hasan in this episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered.’ They discuss the billionaire class running the U.S. government, whether the Democrats have the guts to stand up to Trump, anti-Palestinian rhetoric spreading across America and more.

“I can see this as the kind of the handbooks of an authoritarian leaning regime. What you do is you want to tell people, like your problems are because of those others. This is we've seen this over and over again as you know, as authoritarian regimes have built power and, and we have to stand up to that.”

# “A JERK and THREAT to Democracy” — Democratic Senator Unpacks Elon Musk
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4)
*  What is the future of the Democratic Party [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=0.0s)]
*  in the age of Elon Musk and Donald Trump? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=2.6s)]
*  I'm here in the office of Minnesota Democratic Senator [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=5.68s)]
*  Tina Smith here on Capitol Hill, who just announced recently [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=7.84s)]
*  that she will not be running for reelection [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=10.4s)]
*  in next year's midterms. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Senator Smith, thank you for joining us on Mayor the Unfiltered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=13.68s)]
*  Thank you for welcoming us into your office. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=15.64s)]
*  Thank you so much. I'm really happy to talk to you in person. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=17.14s)]
*  Yes, we did so many COVID remote interviews [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=19.84s)]
*  during my MSNBC days. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=22.740000000000002s)]
*  Appreciate being here. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=24.44s)]
*  You got into a spat with Elon Musk, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=26.58s)]
*  Shadow President Musk on Twitter recently [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=30.18s)]
*  after you criticized the emails that Doge was sending out [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=32.94s)]
*  to federal employees and saying, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=36.42s)]
*  list all your tasks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=37.3s)]
*  And you didn't hold back. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=39.18s)]
*  You said, this is the ultimate dick boss move from Musk, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=40.26s)]
*  except he isn't even the boss. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=44.42s)]
*  He's just a dick. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=46.18s)]
*  You also called him a billionaire asshole boss. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=47.86s)]
*  I'll be honest, Senator, like many people, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=50.620000000000005s)]
*  I'm not used to seeing many Democratic politicians [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=53.46s)]
*  use such colorful language to describe their opponents. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=57.22s)]
*  I mean, I approve of it. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm just wondering in your case, where did it come from? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=61.72s)]
*  Well, so I was, I've been so upset [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=64.72s)]
*  about what has been happening. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=68.08s)]
*  I have been feeling that, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=69.52s)]
*  just feeling it's so important that we speak out, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=71.72s)]
*  that we speak the truth, that we don't hold back. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=74.32s)]
*  And I was literally, I was sitting at home [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=76.92s)]
*  in front of the fire and with my husband, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=79.32s)]
*  and I'm reading that Elon Musk has done this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  And I had that like sense of anger [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=85.8s)]
*  that how many millions of Americans have felt [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=88.52s)]
*  when you got some jerk email from your bad boss [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=91.2s)]
*  on Saturday night, basically saying in so many words, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=96.62s)]
*  prove to me that you're worthy. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=101.04s)]
*  Prove to me that you are actually doing anything [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=102.78s)]
*  that I should care about. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  And I felt so angry for everybody [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=106.28s)]
*  who had gotten that email, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=108.22s)]
*  understanding they were under so much pressure [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=109.36s)]
*  and so much uncertainty anyway. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=112.0s)]
*  And I'm like, who are you? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=114.08s)]
*  And I'm like, what gives you the right? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  He's not even the boss, is he? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=116.52s)]
*  He's not even the boss, exactly. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=117.36s)]
*  And so I just spoke the truth [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  as I would have said it to my husband Archie, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=119.56s)]
*  although the next morning he woke up and he was like, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=121.32s)]
*  what is going on? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=123.32s)]
*  Have you referred to other Republicans as dicks before? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=124.64s)]
*  Is that precedent? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=128.32s)]
*  I don't know that I ever really have. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=129.16s)]
*  Is Musk sui generis here? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=131.16s)]
*  I mean, I am known amongst those who know me [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=133.12s)]
*  as a pretty good at profanity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=135.0s)]
*  So I don't think that part of it was so surprising. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=137.28s)]
*  But what I think is actually going on here [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=139.28s)]
*  is one, connecting with that view [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=141.88s)]
*  that these are just jerk bosses. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=144.24s)]
*  And I'm on the side of the people who are doing the work, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  not on the side of the people [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  that are messing everything up. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=152.36s)]
*  Did you get any pushback from your colleagues [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=154.56s)]
*  or from leadership? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=157.34s)]
*  Your party's known for being obsessed with decorum. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=158.18s)]
*  Yes, well, no, actually I didn't. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=160.24s)]
*  And I mean, in the world and the pantheon of senators, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  I am not certainly one of the ones [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=167.12s)]
*  that has the greatest social media following [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=169.58s)]
*  or the biggest Instagram. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=171.68s)]
*  And so- [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=173.5s)]
*  Well, that tweet went viral. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=174.74s)]
*  I can assure you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=175.58s)]
*  It changed, it changed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  A recent Politico piece referred to a new breed [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=177.24s)]
*  of quote, potty mouth Democrats [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=179.62s)]
*  who are quote, cursing up a storm [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=181.74s)]
*  and are quote, looking for shortcuts to authenticity [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=183.86s)]
*  to channel voters' rage. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=186.86s)]
*  Is that a fair analysis in your view? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=189.06s)]
*  Do you think a lot of people in your party, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm not saying yourself, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=191.5s)]
*  but we are seeing a lot of people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=192.46s)]
*  speaking much more bluntly. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=193.34s)]
*  Is that an attempt to try and connect with people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=194.3s)]
*  in this podcast, Rogan social media era? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=196.62s)]
*  Well, so I think there are a couple of things going on. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=199.62s)]
*  One is that I think most people are really smart [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=201.3s)]
*  and they can tell whether you're coming at this [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=204.86s)]
*  from a position of authenticity. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=206.58s)]
*  Does it sound real? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=207.98000000000002s)]
*  Or does it sound like somebody told you to talk this way [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=208.94s)]
*  in order to appeal to some audience [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=211.54000000000002s)]
*  that you don't really understand? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=212.98000000000002s)]
*  So I think like as always, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=214.3s)]
*  that sense of authenticity and realness, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=216.26000000000002s)]
*  it either comes through or it doesn't. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=218.62s)]
*  And I think people are pretty good [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=220.34s)]
*  at figuring out whether it's real or not. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=221.34s)]
*  But I think there's another thing going on, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=222.86s)]
*  which is that just to be clear, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  in the last election, Democrats, candidates and others [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  spent a huge amount of time and money [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=230.62s)]
*  in one portion of the communications ecosystem. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=233.22s)]
*  And we were not present [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  in huge portions of the media ecosystem, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=241.9s)]
*  the place where most Americans [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=246.3s)]
*  are actually getting their information. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=248.62s)]
*  And I think we made headway in the 2024 election on that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=250.38000000000002s)]
*  We got better at it, but we're still totally outgunned. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=254.18s)]
*  And I think we're learning those lessons. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=256.7s)]
*  Cory Booker and I are working on this. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=258.42s)]
*  We're working with all of our caucus [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=260.3s)]
*  to help to shift the thinking [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=261.66s)]
*  on how you actually talk to people. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=263.82s)]
*  And like, let's have the novel conversation [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=265.86s)]
*  about how we should be talking to people [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=268.18s)]
*  about what they care about, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=269.66s)]
*  rather than trying to tell them what we care about. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=270.98s)]
*  And then you can start to have some authentic conversations [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=273.38s)]
*  and actually build relationships with people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=275.98s)]
*  Just coming back to jerk boss slash dick boss, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=278.54s)]
*  Elon Musk and his politics, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=282.06s)]
*  10 years ago, he was a pretty conventional, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  centrist Democrat who believed in climate change [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=286.82s)]
*  and backed Barack Obama. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  Today he backs not just Trump, but the AFD in Germany. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=291.42s)]
*  He amplifies neo-Nazis, white supremacists on his website. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=294.58000000000004s)]
*  What is your read of him and his politics? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=298.38s)]
*  Well, so I can't look inside his heart and mind. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=300.62s)]
*  I don't know where he's coming from, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=302.66s)]
*  wherever he's coming from right now, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=304.18s)]
*  I think is really despicable. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=305.54s)]
*  He comes off to me like a guy who is pretty sure, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=307.86s)]
*  we've all known these kinds of people, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=311.94s)]
*  they're pretty sure that they're the smartest guy [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  in any room that they walk into. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=315.38s)]
*  Liking this video? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=317.42s)]

*  And so you've got that going on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=334.18s)]
*  At the same time, you had this other thing going on [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=336.14000000000004s)]
*  with our politics right now with the Trump administration, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  which is deeply corrupt. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=340.98s)]
*  So here is an individual who spent 200 and something [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  million dollars electing Donald Trump, very overtly. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=346.82s)]
*  It was an in public transaction. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=350.78s)]
*  This is the money that I'm spending. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=353.54s)]
*  And then in return, this is what I want. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=355.18s)]
*  He's getting it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=357.46s)]
*  And I mean, the most dramatic example of that [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=358.86s)]
*  was the auto show for Tesla that happened on the White House. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=361.34s)]
*  The White House became a car dealership. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=366.34s)]
*  The White House lawn the other day. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=367.26s)]
*  But I mean, in more, maybe slightly more discreet ways, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=369.5s)]
*  so still right out there in public, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=372.42s)]
*  he has his doge guys in at the FAA. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=374.42s)]
*  Saying that this contract that the FAA was working on [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=376.74s)]
*  is not going to work. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=379.38s)]
*  I want Starlink to get that contract. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=380.18s)]
*  It is the most overt corruption. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=381.94s)]
*  And that's, I think, what's happening here. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=385.34000000000003s)]
*  He is not vetted. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=387.1s)]
*  He was not approved by you and your colleagues in the Senate. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=388.94s)]
*  You didn't vote to confirm him. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=391.7s)]
*  No security back now. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=393.14s)]
*  Is he a threat to our democracy? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=394.38s)]
*  I think he is an absolute threat to our democracy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=395.78000000000003s)]
*  But his threat is rooted in Donald Trump. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=397.90000000000003s)]
*  So I think lots of us have been talking about, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=400.5s)]
*  are we focusing too much on Elon Musk? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=403.14s)]
*  Should we remind people that the person who empowers him [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=405.06s)]
*  every day is Trump? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=407.46s)]
*  And I think that that's absolutely right, too. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=409.9s)]
*  I was actually going to ask you, and I've [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=412.62s)]
*  asked a lot of Democrats this question, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=414.42s)]
*  who do you think is in charge? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=415.54s)]
*  Is it Trump leading Elon, or is it Elon leading Trump? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=417.3s)]
*  It's hard to know, right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=421.9s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to know. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=423.22s)]
*  I think that Trump is very wily. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=424.22s)]
*  And I think that he is, on all of the stuff that Doge is doing, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=425.86s)]
*  I mean, right now we have a situation [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=430.22s)]
*  where they are potentially dismantling the Social Security [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=431.98s)]
*  Administration. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=435.38s)]
*  We could talk about that as quite terrifying and quite [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=436.42s)]
*  interesting when you think about how they would go about doing [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=438.94s)]
*  that. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=441.1s)]
*  At the end of the day, Trump is responsible. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=441.62s)]
*  But don't you think that sometimes he's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=443.54s)]
*  happy to have Musk out there sort of absorbing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=444.94s)]
*  some of that attack? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=447.18s)]
*  And then when he thinks when it just becomes too much, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=448.86s)]
*  then Trump could look like he's bringing him back. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=451.74s)]
*  He did this with the cabinet the other day. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=453.70000000000005s)]
*  He said, use a scalpel, not a whatever it was, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=455.5s)]
*  the phrase he used to try and say [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=458.54s)]
*  he's going to restrain Musk. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=459.82s)]
*  But nothing really changed. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=460.98s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=462.78000000000003s)]
*  So it's all performative. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=463.3s)]
*  So on Musk, though, let me ask you this, Senator. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=464.34000000000003s)]
*  Should Democrats have stood up to him much earlier? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=466.42s)]
*  I mean, in 2022, you had control of the White House, the Senate, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=469.82s)]
*  and the House of Representatives. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=474.26s)]
*  And no Democrats did anything to intervene to stop him [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=475.98s)]
*  from buying Twitter. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=479.78000000000003s)]
*  There was no call for investigations or hearings [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=481.1s)]
*  into his security background, his foreign ties. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=484.14000000000004s)]
*  There was no attempt to throw any sand in the wheels. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=487.18s)]
*  As recently as 18 months ago, your boss, Chuck Schumer, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=490.14s)]
*  was hosting him at a forum here in the Senate just 18 months [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=493.5s)]
*  ago. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=496.34s)]
*  And of course, the Biden administration [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=497.02s)]
*  for four years continued handing out multi-billion dollar [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=498.18s)]
*  contracts to his various companies. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=500.18s)]
*  Shouldn't Democrats have taken a stand against Musk much earlier? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=502.02s)]
*  Well, it's hard for me to answer that question. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=504.62s)]
*  I mean, if I knew then what I know now, I would feel, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  you know, who knows what we might have. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=508.65999999999997s)]
*  You had no concerns in 2022 when he was buying Twitter? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=510.02s)]
*  I mean, I didn't like that he was buying Twitter, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=512.38s)]
*  but it wasn't clear to me that there was any legal recourse [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=515.06s)]
*  or anything that we could do to stop it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=517.62s)]
*  And I do want to say, you know, you're [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=519.22s)]
*  referring to this big AI summit that leader Schumer and Todd [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=520.94s)]
*  Young were public, and it was a bipartisan summit that [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=526.3000000000001s)]
*  was convened. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=528.74s)]
*  And there were many, many tech billionaires [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=530.3000000000001s)]
*  and other tech leaders. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=535.62s)]
*  There were also labor leaders, the head of the AFLCO. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=536.82s)]
*  But none of those people had mocked Nancy Pelosi's husband [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=539.86s)]
*  at that point who had been attacked. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=542.62s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=544.02s)]
*  But I think that, I mean, I'm only making the case, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=544.94s)]
*  I'm only making the point that that was an opportunity [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=548.1s)]
*  to sort of hear in a broad way about what these people were [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=551.26s)]
*  really thinking about and looking at when it came to AI. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=555.5s)]
*  It was in no way an endorsement. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=558.54s)]
*  But in hindsight, I'm just wondering, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=560.1s)]
*  knowing what we know now, even if we take that line, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=561.86s)]
*  could Democrats from the administration, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=564.54s)]
*  with contracts, with the Senate, with hearings, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=566.22s)]
*  have done something to stop the richest man in the world [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=568.62s)]
*  from taking over our government? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=570.62s)]
*  He's our threat to our democracy. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=571.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=573.1s)]
*  I mean, it seems sort of old fashioned, doesn't it, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=573.8199999999999s)]
*  in this moment that even just two years ago, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=575.66s)]
*  there would be contracts let by the FAA based on best bid [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=578.38s)]
*  and best contract. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=583.7s)]
*  That's not something that a politician [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=584.98s)]
*  would typically get involved in. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=586.42s)]
*  And in the old fashioned world that we lived in then, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=588.22s)]
*  I would have said that would have been the right thing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=590.58s)]
*  Why should I be determining who gets contracts? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=592.46s)]
*  I can assure you if George Soros tried to buy Fox News [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=595.98s)]
*  tomorrow, Republicans in government wouldn't sit back [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=598.86s)]
*  and let him do it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=600.78s)]
*  Yeah, I hear what you're saying. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=601.62s)]
*  There are a lot of people saying that this is a moment [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=602.46s)]
*  for Democrats to cut ties with an unpopular billionaire class. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=604.3399999999999s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, as you know, is touring the country, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  getting huge crowds for his anti-oligarchy events, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=610.3399999999999s)]
*  tens of thousands of people. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=613.26s)]
*  And yet in a recent retreat for Democratic Party consultants [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=614.54s)]
*  in Virginia, according to Politico, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=617.54s)]
*  they concluded that your party, and I quote, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=619.4599999999999s)]
*  should move away from the dominance of small dollar donors. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=621.8599999999999s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=625.2199999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=626.5s)]
*  It's a weird thing to say after an election [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=628.2199999999999s)]
*  in which actually Harris did a very good job [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=629.9799999999999s)]
*  of raising small donors. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=632.66s)]
*  I mean, our campaign financing system is deeply corrupt. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=634.46s)]
*  And we could talk about some of the deep challenges [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=637.74s)]
*  with the way that we, and everybody raises money [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=640.94s)]
*  from small dollars by creating a sense of angst [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=644.18s)]
*  and deep anxiety to encourage a 75-year-old [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=647.82s)]
*  to give $5 a week when they think they're giving $5. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=651.7s)]
*  I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff to talk about there. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=656.02s)]
*  But the deep corruption in our campaign finance system [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=658.06s)]
*  is the way that highly wealthy individuals [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=660.82s)]
*  can give massive amounts of money with no accountability. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=664.1800000000001s)]
*  And then sometimes, like with Elon Musk, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=666.5400000000001s)]
*  he just put it right out there, this is what I'm doing. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=668.6600000000001s)]
*  But often you don't know who they are. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=670.38s)]
*  And I think here's the problem that we have right now [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=672.14s)]
*  is that Democrats need to return [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=674.62s)]
*  to our populist economic roots. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=677.9s)]
*  And I think this is what Bernie is talking about. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=680.14s)]
*  And your colleague, Chris Murphy, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=682.58s)]
*  has been doing a lot of media on this subject as well. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=683.62s)]
*  He did our show. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=685.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  But then you have Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=687.6600000000001s)]
*  the leader in the House that was reporting [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=688.98s)]
*  that he went to Silicon Valley to make nice [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=690.1800000000001s)]
*  with the tech bosses and say, hey, we're not anti you. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=692.5799999999999s)]
*  So there's mixed messaging coming out from the party. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=694.38s)]
*  Where I am on this is that Americans know [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=697.0999999999999s)]
*  that their government is not working for them. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=701.9399999999999s)]
*  And they realize that as hard as they work, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=704.6999999999999s)]
*  they're not getting ahead. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=707.14s)]
*  Their kids are doing worse than they did. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=708.06s)]
*  And they're trying to figure out what the hell is going on. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=710.42s)]
*  And Donald Trump and Elon Musk are saying, it's easy. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=713.3s)]
*  You are the pure American, you are the true American. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=716.26s)]
*  And the thing that you have to worry about [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=718.86s)]
*  are those immigrants and those black people [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=720.2199999999999s)]
*  who are stealing from you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=722.22s)]
*  And Democrats need to have, we need to say no. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=723.5s)]
*  What's the problem here is that our government [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=727.5s)]
*  is too often serving the interests of the wealthiest people [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=731.62s)]
*  and the biggest corporations, and that's hurting you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=736.14s)]
*  And we're gonna fix it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=738.58s)]
*  Well said. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=739.94s)]
*  I think we can both agree [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=740.98s)]
*  that the Democratic party is split in more ways than one. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=741.82s)]
*  I recently interviewed Washington Congresswoman [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=743.98s)]
*  Pramila Jayapal, who told me that she feels [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=746.1800000000001s)]
*  your party is leaderless right now, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=748.5400000000001s)]
*  given you're in between presidential elections. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=750.2199999999999s)]
*  Whereas Congressman Jim Himes, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=753.18s)]
*  who I spoke to a few days ago, said, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=754.54s)]
*  no, the party isn't leaderless in the House. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=756.3399999999999s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries is doing a fine job. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=758.0999999999999s)]
*  He said, where do you stand on this matter? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=759.66s)]
*  And is Chuck Schumer the right man [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=761.78s)]
*  for this fascistic, chaotic, historic moment that we're in? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=764.38s)]
*  Is it time for a newer, younger, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=768.8599999999999s)]
*  more dynamic leadership for the party? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=771.62s)]
*  Well, so first I just want to observe the obvious, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=773.7399999999999s)]
*  which is that when you are the party out of power, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=775.54s)]
*  when you are a highly fragmented party like we are, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=777.66s)]
*  when you don't have one leader [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=781.02s)]
*  who stands at the top of any pyramid, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=781.86s)]
*  which the Democratic party is in anyway. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=784.5400000000001s)]
*  And you're not a cult. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=786.38s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=787.22s)]
*  We are struggling because of that. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=789.82s)]
*  And we've got the head of the DGA, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=791.58s)]
*  and the head of the DNC, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=793.26s)]
*  and the head of the House, and the head of the... [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=794.38s)]
*  None of those people reached that position [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=796.14s)]
*  because they were like the best spokesperson [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=799.34s)]
*  for the party or the best... [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=801.58s)]
*  And the average American is thinking [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=802.86s)]
*  who speaks for the Democrats. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=803.86s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=805.14s)]
*  And so what I wish was happening more [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=806.14s)]
*  is that this, my party, was making room [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=809.58s)]
*  for some of the dynamic leaders [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=813.62s)]
*  who are excellent communicators, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=815.74s)]
*  who can really make a point. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=817.46s)]
*  People like Chris Murphy and Alyssa Slotkin. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=819.3000000000001s)]
*  And for me, this is not even, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=822.34s)]
*  this is not a left-right issue. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=823.7800000000001s)]
*  This is about our ability to connect with people [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=825.74s)]
*  and what's really happening in their lives. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=828.34s)]
*  Because I think you take the list of progressive policy goals [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=829.7s)]
*  that we have, you might say, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=837.3000000000001s)]
*  oh, those are left, but actually, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=839.38s)]
*  it's what most Americans want. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=840.7s)]
*  What I wish was happening is that our leadership [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=842.26s)]
*  would make room for those leaders [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=844.1s)]
*  so that they could step into that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=845.22s)]
*  So you mentioned Michigan Senator Alyssa Slotkin, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=847.38s)]
*  rising star in your party. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=849.62s)]
*  The Democrats picked her to represent your party [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=850.7800000000001s)]
*  and respond to Donald Trump's address to Congress. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=852.98s)]
*  You called her rebuttal, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=855.02s)]
*  the best so-to response I've ever seen. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=855.98s)]
*  Slotkin told the Atlantic that the highest praise [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=858.82s)]
*  she hoped to hear for her speech was, and I quote, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=861.14s)]
*  that sounded pretty normal. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=863.5400000000001s)]
*  And I get that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=865.86s)]
*  We live in a very abnormal era. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=866.7s)]
*  When you listen to Donald Trump speak, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=868.1s)]
*  you're desperate for normality. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=869.58s)]
*  But a lot of your critics within the party, in your base, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=871.38s)]
*  I spend a lot of time on Blue Sky now, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=873.86s)]
*  or a lot of hardcore Democrats [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=875.3000000000001s)]
*  want your party to do more. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=877.38s)]
*  You see it, right? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=878.82s)]
*  They say sounding normal's not good enough. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=880.1s)]
*  We need something more than that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=882.14s)]
*  What do you say to people who say that to you? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=884.1s)]
*  Well, I think what people are craving [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=885.7s)]
*  is a vision for the future. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=887.7s)]
*  And that sounds, even just saying that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=889.38s)]
*  sounds a bit cliche, but- [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=890.86s)]
*  But maybe also anger, passion? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=892.5400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=894.1800000000001s)]
*  Moral outrage. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=895.02s)]
*  And a sense of urgency. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=895.86s)]
*  But a sense of, like, help me believe [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=897.6999999999999s)]
*  that you have a better idea [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=901.6999999999999s)]
*  and that you can lead me to that better idea, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=902.98s)]
*  that you can build the coalition of support [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=904.9399999999999s)]
*  to accomplish that better idea. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=906.66s)]
*  Now, Alyssa, and it was one of the hardest jobs in politics, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=908.78s)]
*  you've got a very short period of time [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=912.42s)]
*  to try to reach out to a large number of people [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=914.18s)]
*  and just say something that people will understand. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=917.5s)]
*  And I thought she did a great job of that. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=920.02s)]
*  But this is not to say that we're on, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=922.26s)]
*  I mean, we are in an urgent moment. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=924.22s)]
*  And, you know, we, this is, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=926.14s)]
*  I criticize my party for being too cautious, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=928.5s)]
*  too incremental. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=931.54s)]
*  I think it's some of that old neoliberal, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=932.46s)]
*  like, oh, we're gonna do a little tax incentive [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=935.46s)]
*  so that childcare is a little bit more affordable [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=937.86s)]
*  instead of saying, no, hold the phone. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=939.9s)]
*  Like, we need to completely rethink [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=941.98s)]
*  the way people get childcare in this country. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=944.22s)]
*  And healthcare. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=946.22s)]
*  And healthcare and housing. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=947.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=948.8199999999999s)]
*  So here's what I don't get, though. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=949.66s)]
*  Senator Slotkin rightly said in that speech, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=950.9399999999999s)]
*  in her response, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=953.42s)]
*  that democracy is at risk right now from Donald Trump. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=954.42s)]
*  That's were her words. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=957.02s)]
*  And yet she has voted to confirm almost half [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=958.2199999999999s)]
*  of Donald Trump's cabinet nominees, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=960.9399999999999s)]
*  as have a lot of your Senate colleagues. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=962.86s)]
*  In fact, since giving that response to Trump, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=964.74s)]
*  she and six other Democratic senators [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=966.66s)]
*  confirmed his Labor Secretary nominee just the other day, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=968.66s)]
*  which I know you voted against. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=970.86s)]
*  As I said, several, I can't remember how many, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=973.26s)]
*  but a bunch of Senate Democrats have voted to confirm [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=974.9s)]
*  almost half of his cabinet nominees. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=977.3s)]
*  Doesn't that send mixed messages to the voters? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=979.62s)]
*  Trump threatens our democracy, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=982.02s)]
*  but we're gonna keep voting to confirm [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=983.94s)]
*  his unqualified nominees. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=985.3800000000001s)]
*  Well, so, all I can, this is how I make my decisions. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=987.0600000000001s)]
*  Do I believe that somebody is capable of doing the job? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=990.5s)]
*  And two, do I believe they're gonna follow the law? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=993.2600000000001s)]
*  And that is why I am voting against, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=996.5400000000001s)]
*  I think, nearly all of these nominees. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=999.4200000000001s)]
*  I voted for Secretary Rubio [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1001.7s)]
*  because I was not yet fully on, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1004.22s)]
*  not yet fully appreciating the capacity of these people [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  to not follow the law. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1011.74s)]
*  I mean, 99 senators voted for Marco Rubio. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1012.74s)]
*  Every Democrat, including you, Elizabeth Warren, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1014.98s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, you all voted for him. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1017.5s)]
*  At the time, some of us were like, what is going on here? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1019.14s)]
*  Was it collegiality that he's a former Senate colleague? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1021.74s)]
*  Because right now, he's the guy helping Trump [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1024.54s)]
*  throw Zelensky under the bus. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1026.98s)]
*  He's the guy personally trying to deport [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1028.38s)]
*  a Palestinian green card holder [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1030.98s)]
*  and leading that authoritarian charge. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1032.5s)]
*  And yet every Democratic senator voted for him. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1034.58s)]
*  So, you learn a lesson. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1036.5s)]
*  I think what happens a lot of times, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1039.1000000000001s)]
*  one of the criteria that my colleagues use [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1041.7s)]
*  when they're trying to decide who to vote for, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1044.1000000000001s)]
*  and I think this is why the Labor Secretary [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1045.9s)]
*  got so many votes, is they're asking themselves, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1048.78s)]
*  understanding she had the support of a lot of labor unions, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1053.18s)]
*  people will say to themselves, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1058.98s)]
*  this is the best that we can expect [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1059.8200000000002s)]
*  from this administration. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1061.22s)]
*  This person is gonna be better [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1062.14s)]
*  than who might come up next, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1063.5400000000002s)]
*  and therefore I'm gonna support this person [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1065.18s)]
*  because I don't want the worst alternative down the road. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1066.74s)]
*  And I think that that is how some folks, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1069.38s)]
*  I'm not saying that's how I do it, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1071.18s)]
*  but I think that I can understand [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1072.38s)]
*  why people make those decisions. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1073.78s)]
*  And I think when you are representing a state [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1076.3400000000001s)]
*  where you know that a large proportion [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1078.46s)]
*  of the people who voted for you [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1079.9s)]
*  also voted for Donald Trump, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1080.98s)]
*  then you are, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1082.6200000000001s)]
*  let me put it this way, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1085.8600000000001s)]
*  the path forward is to not tell every Trump voter [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1087.26s)]
*  in this country that they're full of it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1090.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1092.74s)]
*  The path forward. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1093.5800000000002s)]
*  No, I agree with that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1094.42s)]
*  And I know that's not what you're saying. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1095.26s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1096.1000000000001s)]
*  I just worry that sometimes [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1096.94s)]
*  there's a little bit too much savviness in DC. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1097.78s)]
*  I don't think the average Michigan voter is thinking, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1100.3799999999999s)]
*  did Alyssa Slotkin vote for the Labor Secretary [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1102.54s)]
*  and checking a scorecard before they go to vote? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1104.62s)]
*  But on Rubio, Chris Van Hollen, Chris Murphy [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1107.22s)]
*  have come out and said, we regret our votes for Rubio. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1110.34s)]
*  I assume you're in the same camp? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1112.06s)]
*  I do. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1113.34s)]
*  When you look at the Democratic Party today, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1114.6599999999999s)]
*  do you see a party that has the guts, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1116.58s)]
*  the backbone, the energy to stand up [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1120.22s)]
*  to people like Musk and Trump? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1122.4199999999998s)]
*  Because we saw in that speech to Congress, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1123.74s)]
*  only one Democrat was willing to stand up [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1126.58s)]
*  and actually call out Donald Trump to his face, Al Green. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1128.74s)]
*  He was ejected. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1131.74s)]
*  10 Democrats then voted to censure him. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1132.6200000000001s)]
*  One of those 10, Jim Himes came on my show not long ago [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1134.94s)]
*  and said, while defending his vote of censure, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1138.86s)]
*  he did actually say to me something interesting. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1141.06s)]
*  He said, look, in hindsight, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1142.54s)]
*  maybe when Trump started attacking all of us [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1144.06s)]
*  and saying you're radical left lunatics [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1146.06s)]
*  and making racist jibes about Elizabeth Warren, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1147.74s)]
*  we should have all en masse got up and walked out. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1149.86s)]
*  That would have been a powerful moment. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1151.7s)]
*  What do you make of that idea? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1153.18s)]
*  Do you think there should have been [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1154.22s)]
*  something more demonstrative, performative [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1155.06s)]
*  that night than the Democrats? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1158.1399999999999s)]
*  And the paddles really didn't cut it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1159.62s)]
*  I agree. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1162.98s)]
*  I think that, I think it's a hard, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1164.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, honestly, it's hard. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1167.98s)]
*  But in every moment, we're all trying to figure out [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1169.34s)]
*  what is the best way? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1173.62s)]
*  What is the best way to condemn this individual, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1174.98s)]
*  to heighten the sense of urgency [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1177.22s)]
*  about the actions that we need to take [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1179.02s)]
*  and to encourage people, to help people really believe [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1180.3s)]
*  that they have in themselves and the actions that they take, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1183.06s)]
*  the power to make a difference. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1186.26s)]
*  I mean, this is the strategy of, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1188.02s)]
*  this is the Trump strategy, obviously. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1191.3s)]
*  We're gonna flood everybody with so much crap [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1193.22s)]
*  that you don't even know what to respond to next. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1196.5s)]
*  So- Flood the zone. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1199.1s)]
*  And it's not, yeah, flood the zone. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1199.94s)]
*  You're gonna be exhausted, you're gonna feel powerless. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1201.82s)]
*  And what you'll do is you'll tune out. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1203.82s)]
*  And right now, that's working for a lot of Americans [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1205.1799999999998s)]
*  who are just so, it's so overwhelming. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1208.78s)]
*  They don't wanna even think about it [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1211.34s)]
*  or talk about it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1212.7s)]
*  And so what we're trying to do in the moment [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1213.54s)]
*  is to figure out, like, it's a constant calibration. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1215.66s)]
*  Now, what I think happened under the State of the Union [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1218.6200000000001s)]
*  is that, I mean, I went, some of my colleagues didn't go. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1221.54s)]
*  I felt that it was sort of my responsibility to bear witness. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1224.8600000000001s)]
*  And I also thought that if I went, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1227.5800000000002s)]
*  I was gonna get more attention for the things [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1229.02s)]
*  I was gonna say about what the president said. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1230.5800000000002s)]
*  That I wanted the attention to be on him [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1232.46s)]
*  about the terrible things that he said, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1234.3s)]
*  about the way that he approached it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1235.74s)]
*  I think this is the, who knows what the right thing to do is. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1237.78s)]
*  Honestly, I'm not arrogant enough [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1241.3799999999999s)]
*  to think that I know for sure. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1242.82s)]
*  But I do think the focus should be on him [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1244.62s)]
*  and not on our demonstrations, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1247.3799999999999s)]
*  which I believe is actually a distraction. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1249.1s)]
*  So as you know, since the election, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1250.98s)]
*  there's been a debate in your party [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1252.1s)]
*  as to what went wrong, why did you lose, who's to blame? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1253.1s)]
*  People from different wings point the fingers [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1256.8999999999999s)]
*  at different wings, as is often the case. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1258.5s)]
*  Senator Slotkin told the Atlantic magazine [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1260.9399999999998s)]
*  after her speech, it doesn't win elections [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1262.6599999999999s)]
*  to just speak to the base of the party. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1264.74s)]
*  If it did, Kamala Harris would be president. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1266.58s)]
*  And it has become fashionable on the, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1269.42s)]
*  I don't know what you wanna call it, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1271.22s)]
*  moderate centrist wing of the party to say [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1272.3000000000002s)]
*  there was too much kowtowing to the base, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1274.1000000000001s)]
*  to the leftists, to the groups, to the activists. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1275.7s)]
*  Do you share that view? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1279.54s)]
*  No, not really. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1281.54s)]
*  I mean, I think, here's what I think. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1282.6200000000001s)]
*  I think Democrats have to have a real reckoning [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1286.78s)]
*  about the fact that the relationship [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1288.6200000000001s)]
*  that we thought we had with voters, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1290.1000000000001s)]
*  our base voters and others, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1292.3400000000001s)]
*  that relationship is not that great. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1293.8200000000002s)]
*  It's weak. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1295.8600000000001s)]
*  People don't think that we're standing up for them. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1297.22s)]
*  They don't, as I've been saying, somewhat ingest, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1300.26s)]
*  but I mean, it's like the old thing, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1302.34s)]
*  they're just not that into us. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1304.5s)]
*  And we have to evaluate that. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1306.58s)]
*  And I think that this argument or this discussion [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1308.5s)]
*  about base versus persuadables, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1310.58s)]
*  it sort of dehumanizes the reality of where people are [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1315.34s)]
*  in their lives and what they really care about. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1318.5s)]
*  And that, I believe, is what we need to focus on. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1320.34s)]
*  And I worry a lot about this, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1323.22s)]
*  do we need to be more moderate or more left? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1326.06s)]
*  Because I don't think that's the issue. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1327.9s)]
*  The most progressive ideas that we have [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1329.86s)]
*  in the Democratic Party are often the most popular ideas [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1331.34s)]
*  that we have in our party. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1334.86s)]
*  It's also, the way I see it, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1335.86s)]
*  it's not as much left versus right as, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1337.62s)]
*  do you have a fight or not a fight? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1339.54s)]
*  If people want to see some fight, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1340.86s)]
*  regardless of the policy position. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1342.3s)]
*  And are you on our, whose side are you on? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1344.02s)]
*  It makes me laugh when I hear people saying [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1346.6599999999999s)]
*  Harris tried to appease the lefty base and the activists [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1348.34s)]
*  when on the crucial issue of Gaza, she refused to listen. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1351.1799999999998s)]
*  She refused to break with Joe Biden. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1355.22s)]
*  She refused to say anything different. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1356.82s)]
*  She wouldn't entertain an arms embargo [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1358.54s)]
*  or even criticize Netanyahu publicly. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1360.94s)]
*  A YouGov poll a few months ago found that Gaza [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1362.94s)]
*  was the top issue for Biden 2020 voters [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1365.18s)]
*  who cast a ballot for someone other [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1368.06s)]
*  than Kamala Harris in 2024. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1369.86s)]
*  Would you agree that Gaza hurt your party, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1371.74s)]
*  especially with young voters, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1374.34s)]
*  people of color last November? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1375.82s)]
*  I honestly can't say that. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1378.34s)]
*  I mean, in a way I want to respond to that, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1379.74s)]
*  like my old self as a strategist and a, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1381.78s)]
*  like show me the data, let's look at this. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1384.78s)]
*  I'm going to just put that aside because as a senator, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1387.3s)]
*  I think that Harris tried to put a little bit of space [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1391.4199999999998s)]
*  between her and the president, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1399.82s)]
*  but she was also so constrained by that. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1401.54s)]
*  And I think that at the end of the day, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1404.54s)]
*  that was one of the things that was difficult. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1406.98s)]
*  I think you look at the election [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1411.02s)]
*  and what happened in the presidential election [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1412.74s)]
*  or losing the Senate, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1414.62s)]
*  it's a mistake to say that there is one thing or, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1416.3s)]
*  because I don't think it's the case. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1419.74s)]
*  Not one thing, but it was a top issue for a lot of people [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1421.78s)]
*  who stayed at home or diverted to other areas. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1424.06s)]
*  You were one of the 19 Senate Democrats who voted last year [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1426.46s)]
*  in favor of Senator Bernie Sanders' [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1429.3799999999999s)]
*  ultimately unsuccessful attempt to stop the sale [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1431.1399999999999s)]
*  of some US arms to Israel. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1433.82s)]
*  But that 19 is less than half of the [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1436.06s)]
*  Senate Democratic caucus. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1438.26s)]
*  Forget Republicans, none of whom voted for it. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1439.34s)]
*  The majority of your Democratic colleagues refused to vote. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1441.82s)]
*  For a majority of House Democrats last year refused to call [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1443.98s)]
*  for a ceasefire. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1446.98s)]
*  For a lot of activists and regular voters, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1447.8200000000002s)]
*  the Democratic party looks like it's scared of Israel, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1449.5400000000002s)]
*  of AIPAC, of the pro-Israel lobby, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1452.9s)]
*  of being accused of being anti-Israel or anti-Semitic. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1455.42s)]
*  That does seem undeniable. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1458.6200000000001s)]
*  You asked that question as if there's sort of like [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1464.22s)]
*  some big monolithic Democratic party and that, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1466.0200000000002s)]
*  I can explain it and I can't. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1468.98s)]
*  Well, you're in a minority. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1471.0600000000002s)]
*  And so what I'm saying is you're in a minority [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1472.3400000000001s)]
*  in the party on this issue. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1473.7s)]
*  The majority are still going along with killing arms, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1475.02s)]
*  not calling for a ceasefire. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1478.58s)]
*  And people wonder, a party that's progressive [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1479.9s)]
*  on so many issues, on this one issue, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1482.1399999999999s)]
*  you're with Netanyahu. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1484.94s)]
*  My view of it was that that was an opportunity to say [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1486.06s)]
*  that we are gonna stand up for our values, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1489.3s)]
*  that we are not gonna allow, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1491.34s)]
*  we're not gonna become complicit [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1493.7s)]
*  in the actions of this person, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1495.62s)]
*  and also the activities of this country [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1500.78s)]
*  when we believe that they're antithetical to our values. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1503.42s)]
*  And also in my mind, not following our laws. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1505.42s)]
*  When it comes to- Yes, but you did become complicit. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1509.14s)]
*  Not you personally, but the United States [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1510.22s)]
*  did become complicit through weapon sales [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1511.9s)]
*  and ignoring the Lehele and all of this stuff. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1513.7s)]
*  You would agree with that? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1516.74s)]
*  I mean, I think it was bad decision [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1517.5800000000002s)]
*  for people not to vote aside yet, of course. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1519.6200000000001s)]
*  There's also a pervasive anti-Palestinian racism [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1522.3400000000001s)]
*  in US politics and American public life. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1524.26s)]
*  You have Donald Trump using Palestinian as a pejorative. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1525.8200000000002s)]
*  He called Chuck Schumer a Palestinian and said, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1529.3000000000002s)]
*  he's not Jewish anymore, he's a Palestinian. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1531.6599999999999s)]
*  Such a disgusting thing to say. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1533.98s)]
*  Disgusting thing to say. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1534.82s)]
*  But even Joe Biden was criticized [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1535.9399999999998s)]
*  by Palestinian Americans last year [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1537.3799999999999s)]
*  for seeming indifferent to their pain, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1538.54s)]
*  questioning the Palestinian death toll. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1540.9399999999998s)]
*  And now you have a Palestinian green card holder [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1542.82s)]
*  in New York, en route to being deported possibly. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1544.86s)]
*  He's been detained, disappeared. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1548.02s)]
*  Is it not racism and prejudice [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1549.9399999999998s)]
*  that is driving a lot of anti-Palestinian discourse [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1551.86s)]
*  in the US right now? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1553.74s)]
*  I think that it is. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1554.62s)]
*  I mean, I think what we're seeing here with Khalil, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1556.5s)]
*  Mr. Khalil is, I mean, at the very least, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1559.6599999999999s)]
*  we should be able to come together around the idea [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1564.8999999999999s)]
*  that everybody deserves due process in this country. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1567.2199999999998s)]
*  And the, but this is, you know, we, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1570.9799999999998s)]
*  I can see this as the kind of the handbooks [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1575.5s)]
*  of an authoritarian leaning regime. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1578.6599999999999s)]
*  What you do is you wanna tell people, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1580.9399999999998s)]
*  like your problems are because of those others. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1583.06s)]
*  This is, we've seen this over and over again, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1585.9399999999998s)]
*  as authoritarian regimes have built power. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1588.26s)]
*  And we have to stand up to that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1591.46s)]
*  And like these people are bullies. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1593.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1598.06s)]
*  And if you don't stand up to bullies, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1598.9s)]
*  they will keep on taking things from you. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1601.7s)]
*  And that is, I think, the moment that we're in. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1604.18s)]
*  You announced recently that this will be your last term [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1606.94s)]
*  as Senator saying it's a huge honor, huge responsibility, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1608.66s)]
*  but I also never have had the feeling [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1611.22s)]
*  that I needed to do this until I was, you know, ancient. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1613.18s)]
*  Now you are 67 years young, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1617.14s)]
*  but of course, ancient is a relative term. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1619.7s)]
*  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi is 84 years old. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1621.98s)]
*  Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa is 91 years old. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1625.18s)]
*  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, 74 years old. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1628.9s)]
*  The president is 78, his predecessor was 82. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1631.8600000000001s)]
*  Does US politics have an age problem? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1635.18s)]
*  Are we living in a gerontocracy? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1636.8600000000001s)]
*  We are living in a time where we need new leaders. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1638.54s)]
*  We need young leaders. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1641.78s)]
*  We need leaders that Americans can see [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1642.86s)]
*  and can relate to in some really important ways. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1646.4199999999998s)]
*  And my father is 95. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1649.3s)]
*  I just watched a video of him driving his ATV around [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1654.3s)]
*  on the road where the cabin is. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1657.1799999999998s)]
*  And so I don't know about you, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1660.8999999999999s)]
*  but I feel this sort of tension [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1664.54s)]
*  because I don't wanna say, oh, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1665.8999999999999s)]
*  just because you reach a certain age. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1667.26s)]
*  Does your dad wanna run for your seat? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1668.86s)]
*  No, he does not. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1669.86s)]
*  And in fact, he often says like, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1670.7s)]
*  I'm 95 and I'm in pretty good shape, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1672.06s)]
*  but like I am not into that. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1673.8600000000001s)]
*  But I don't know about you, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1677.3400000000001s)]
*  but I feel some tension and pull about not wanting to say [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1678.5800000000002s)]
*  that because you are a certain age that you're not capable. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1682.5800000000002s)]
*  I don't wanna do that. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1685.18s)]
*  I don't wanna express that value. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1688.3s)]
*  But what I, and I said this when I was announcing [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1690.06s)]
*  that I was gonna not run again. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1692.9s)]
*  I look at the next 10 years of my life [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1696.82s)]
*  and what I wanna do in my life. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1698.26s)]
*  And this isn't the only thing. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1700.1399999999999s)]
*  And if I felt differently, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1702.34s)]
*  if I felt like if I was the only one who could do this job, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1703.78s)]
*  maybe I would feel like, yes, indeed, I have to stay here. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1706.82s)]
*  I do think that too many of my colleagues [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1708.9399999999998s)]
*  who've been here for a long time, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1711.4199999999998s)]
*  develop the feeling that they are the only ones [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1712.86s)]
*  and they're not. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1715.34s)]
*  Well put. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1717.6999999999998s)]
*  What would you say to critics just very briefly [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1718.54s)]
*  who say Gary Peters is not standing in Michigan, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1720.2199999999998s)]
*  Jan Shaheen just announced in New Hampshire, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1724.54s)]
*  she's not standing, you're in Minnesota. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1726.1799999999998s)]
*  Some people might say, are you jumping from a sinking ship? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1728.66s)]
*  This is Democrats not wanting to run again [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1731.5s)]
*  because they're worried about the future of the Senate. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1733.5400000000002s)]
*  What do you say to people who say that? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1735.1000000000001s)]
*  I understand why people would ask that, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1736.1000000000001s)]
*  but the answer is absolutely not. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1737.6200000000001s)]
*  I think if you're a John Tester in Montana, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1740.9s)]
*  you might decide to run again, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1744.46s)]
*  even if like a big part of you wishes [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1745.94s)]
*  that you didn't need to do that, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1747.94s)]
*  because you probably are the only one [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1749.18s)]
*  who could win a statewide election. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1750.9s)]
*  And he did way better than the top of the ticket in Montana. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1752.1000000000001s)]
*  He was really indispensable in that sense. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1755.8600000000001s)]
*  But the rest of us are not. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1758.74s)]
*  And I think there's great power in coming, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1761.1000000000001s)]
*  serving for a while, doing everything that you can [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1764.38s)]
*  and then moving on. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1766.98s)]
*  And given you're not running again next year, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1769.02s)]
*  what do you think your colleagues who are running again [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1771.22s)]
*  in 2026 should do that they didn't do in 2024? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1773.38s)]
*  Well, one, I think they need to figure out [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1777.26s)]
*  how to go to where voters are and communicate with them [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1779.02s)]
*  in the places where voters are. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1782.42s)]
*  I think we're learning that lesson [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1784.14s)]
*  and Senator Booker and I are working on helping [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1785.46s)]
*  our Senate colleagues figure that out. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1787.54s)]
*  But I think, again, that sounds sort of obvious, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1789.8999999999999s)]
*  but sometimes the best things are obvious. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1793.74s)]
*  Way before I was ever in the Senate, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1796.94s)]
*  I used to be a focus group moderator. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1798.1s)]
*  And so I learned how to really listen to people, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1800.3s)]
*  not just sort of listen. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1803.42s)]
*  And I think right now in this moment, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1806.6599999999999s)]
*  what our colleagues should be doing [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1810.1399999999999s)]
*  is getting the hell out of Washington [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1811.3799999999999s)]
*  as much as we possibly can and be out there listening [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1813.3799999999999s)]
*  and talking to voters. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1815.5s)]
*  Last question for you. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1817.1s)]
*  A lot of people out there look at Washington, D.C. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1819.06s)]
*  D.C. is now pejorative, as you know. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1821.98s)]
*  People think everyone in politics is corrupt. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1823.54s)]
*  They think Congress doesn't get anything done [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1826.58s)]
*  and there's some truth to that. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1828.7s)]
*  But of course, that's not the whole truth. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1830.1399999999999s)]
*  And in fact, some could argue Joe Biden lost [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1831.34s)]
*  because people didn't realize he had done [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1832.98s)]
*  the American Rescue Plan or the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1834.82s)]
*  or the CHIPS Act. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1837.3s)]
*  There was actually a lot of legislative activity. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1838.1399999999999s)]
*  I just wonder if you're talking to someone [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1840.86s)]
*  and telling them about your seven years in the Senate, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1842.3799999999999s)]
*  what vote of yours are you most proud of? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1846.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, honestly, I haven't thought about [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1849.1000000000001s)]
*  what the vote is that I'm most proud of, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1850.6200000000001s)]
*  but what I have done right now, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1852.14s)]
*  I feel there's two years left, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1854.26s)]
*  so who knows what might happen next. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1855.7800000000002s)]
*  I am very proud of the work [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1859.14s)]
*  that I've done around mental health. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1861.98s)]
*  And speaking directly about the need for better access [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1863.6200000000001s)]
*  to mental health care, talking personally [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1867.0200000000002s)]
*  about my own experience with depression [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fubPLSVK4&t=1868.66s)]
