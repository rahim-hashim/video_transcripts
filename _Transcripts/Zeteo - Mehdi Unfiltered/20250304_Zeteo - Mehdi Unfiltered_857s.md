Video Description: “I think Americans are going to take to the streets. There's part of me that believes Trump wants Americans to take to the streets, because Trump wants to use the military.”

Ex-Republican Congressman and 'Never Trumper' Joe Walsh joins Mehdi Hasan in a two-part interview on ‘Mehdi Unfiltered.’ In *Part One* they discuss Donald Trump — the Democrats' failure to push back, whether the US is heading towards civil war, and Elon Musk’s ‘constitutional crisis.’

In *PART TWO* Mehdi and Walsh get into a HEATED debate about Israel and Gaza. Profanities were uttered, and, at one point, Walsh even grabbed Mehdi’s questions paper out of his hand!

# ‘Hell Yes’ We Could See Civil War in the US
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI)
*  Former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=0.0s)]
*  was once a proud ally of the right-wing Tea Party. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=2.04s)]
*  He hated Barack Obama, obsessed over radical Islam, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=5.14s)]
*  and endorsed Donald Trump in 2016. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=8.58s)]
*  He's since become a never-Trump Republican, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=10.98s)]
*  regretted a lot of his old offensive comments, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=13.32s)]
*  and even voted for Joe Biden. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=15.82s)]
*  He and I had many conversations when I was at MSNBC [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=17.72s)]
*  and agreed on a lot about the threat posed by Trump and MAGA. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=20.7s)]
*  But where we disagree a lot is on Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=24.22s)]
*  So this interview is in two parts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=27.46s)]
*  First, we're going to talk about what we agree on, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=30.060000000000002s)]
*  the danger from Trump, and then in part two, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=32.3s)]
*  on what we disagree on, the danger from Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=34.94s)]
*  Joe Walsh, who now writes the social contract on Substack, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=38.4s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=42.28s)]
*  Thank you, Joe, for coming on May the Unfiltered. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  Good to be with you, my friend. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=44.58s)]
*  Good to be with you in person here in D.C. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=45.42s)]
*  We spoke many years remotely when I was at MSNBC. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=47.58s)]
*  We're now back into a second Trump term. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=51.22s)]
*  We are over five weeks into a second Trump term. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  Is it as bad as you thought it would be? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=56.66s)]
*  Is it worse? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=59.26s)]
*  What has stood out to you the most [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  from the past month or so? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=62.81999999999999s)]
*  I think it's worse. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=64.06s)]
*  I'm not surprised, but I think it's worse. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=65.1s)]
*  Mehdi, what stood out to me is, not you and not me, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=67.89999999999999s)]
*  how the Democrats seem to be caught flat-footed. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=71.96s)]
*  He told us every single freaking day during that campaign [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=75.17999999999999s)]
*  what he was going to do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  He told us every day during that campaign [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=79.5s)]
*  he was going to be a dictator, a king. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  And for him to win and then be sworn in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  and the Democrats really don't know how to react to it, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=87.14s)]
*  that's been mind-boggling to me. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=90.1s)]
*  One thing I don't think any of us, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=92.33999999999999s)]
*  correct me if I'm wrong, even you, but certainly not me, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=94.38s)]
*  quite anticipated is that this would be a co-dictatorship, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=96.72s)]
*  that you would have President Trump and President Musk. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=99.82s)]
*  It's almost crazy to think that six months ago, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=102.06s)]
*  Musk had not even been on stage with Trump. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=104.86s)]
*  That's how quickly it all happened. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=106.8s)]
*  He endorses him in the summer, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=108.02s)]
*  turns up with him in October, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  and is now made a special government employee [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=110.82s)]
*  or whatever he is right now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=113.44s)]
*  You have been a close student of all things Trump [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=114.92s)]
*  for almost a decade. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=117.28s)]
*  Is Musk working for Trump or is Trump working for Musk? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=118.58s)]
*  I think Musk is working for himself [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=121.92s)]
*  and he's working for Trump. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=124.02s)]
*  Medi, we're in a constitutional crisis [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=125.86s)]
*  and it just pisses me off when people say [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=130.0s)]
*  we shouldn't say that yet [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=132.26s)]
*  because he hasn't formally defied quarters yet. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=134.14s)]
*  Bull crap. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=136.4s)]
*  We're supposed to have three independent branches [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=138.28s)]
*  of government. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=140.88s)]
*  I worked in one. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=141.7s)]
*  Congress isn't there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=144.04s)]
*  I don't think the American people realize that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=144.88s)]
*  We only have two independent branches [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  of government right now. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=148.95999999999998s)]
*  My former colleagues, Medi, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=150.2s)]
*  they have pledged fealty to him. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=151.6s)]
*  They don't give a flying you-know-what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  about the Constitution. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=155.54s)]
*  A healthy Congress would have hauled Elon Musk's ass [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  in front of them under oath three weeks ago [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  and just said, what in God's name are you doing? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=164.16s)]
*  Just tell us what you're doing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=166.26s)]
*  But they roll over again and again. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=168.14s)]
*  I mean, you and I spent many years discussing [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=169.56s)]
*  how Republicans in Congress roll over for Trump, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=171.76s)]
*  but now they're rolling over for Donald Trump [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=174.0s)]
*  and Elon Musk. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=175.44s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=176.56s)]
*  The cult is extended to two. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  They roll over because you know politicians [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=179.23999999999998s)]
*  want to get re-elected. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  He's threatening to pay for primaries [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  against any Republican. Oh my God, yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=184.88s)]
*  Yeah, now Musk is not as popular with the base, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  I hear from them every day, as Trump is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=188.88s)]
*  Trump's hold on the base is ironclad. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=191.28s)]
*  No, never let go. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=193.28s)]
*  They fear Musk's money [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=194.64s)]
*  because he will put money into primary challenges. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=197.32s)]
*  It's interesting you talk about Trump's grip on the base [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=200.35999999999999s)]
*  and I agree with you on that as well. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  I remember when people were saying, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  Ron DeSantis will win the nomination. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=204.56s)]
*  I said, no he's not. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=206.12s)]
*  Trump will defeat DeSantis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=207.04s)]
*  And people didn't believe us, but we were right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  He has a grip on the base. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=210.88s)]
*  There was a lot of talk about conservatives [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=213.12s)]
*  peeling away from Donald Trump, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=214.76s)]
*  disappointed by the insurrection, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  not wanting to see a return to chaos. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=218.2s)]
*  They would prefer a DeSantis. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=219.6s)]
*  They might switch over to Harris. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=221.0s)]
*  There was the whole talk of Nikki Haley Republicans, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=223.84s)]
*  which I always thought was weird [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=225.68s)]
*  because Nikki Haley endorsed Trump. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=226.6s)]
*  So you are a never Trump Republican. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  Democrats spent a lot of time wooing never Trump Republicans. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=231.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris went on the campaign trail [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=235.04s)]
*  with Liz Cheney more than she did with Sean Fain [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=237.04s)]
*  or AOC or people on the left. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=238.83999999999997s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  Most conservatives stuck with Donald Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  There was not some big shift. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  Democrats lost. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=245.16s)]
*  Was that a failed strategy that you were invested in? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=246.48s)]
*  It's a great question, Mehdi, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=249.72s)]
*  and I think about it every day [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=251.04s)]
*  because I was out there every day, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=252.28s)]
*  Republicans for Harris, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=254.28s)]
*  in a battleground state campaigning for her. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  Well-intentioned, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=257.20000000000005s)]
*  I'm not questioning your intent. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=258.68s)]
*  I'm just wondering, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=259.68s)]
*  did you believe that these people are gonna come over [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=260.52000000000004s)]
*  and we're gonna defeat Trump in this way? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=262.48s)]
*  Yes, I thought more would. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=264.48s)]
*  Now some did. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=267.04s)]
*  The way I look at it, Mehdi, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=269.36s)]
*  is we were helping, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=270.6s)]
*  Kamala had a cut on her arm [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  and we put a bandaid on that cut. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=274.36s)]
*  She had an open gash on her leg with a tourniquet [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=277.24s)]
*  and we didn't do anything about that. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=281.56s)]
*  She definitely lost a lot of enthusiasm [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=283.32000000000005s)]
*  and support on her left flank as well. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=286.44s)]
*  But the left flank would say she spent far too much time [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=289.2s)]
*  with the Never Trump Conservatives. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  Even Jen Psaki, who we both know, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  who was not a lefty, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=296.12s)]
*  one of her first comments after the election, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=297.23999999999995s)]
*  I remember when MSNBC was like, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=298.64s)]
*  maybe we spent too much time talking to Never Trump Conservatives. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=300.08s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what pisses me off? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=302.08s)]
*  When I was on Jen Psaki's show during the campaign [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=303.35999999999996s)]
*  and she was applauding this effort. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=305.91999999999996s)]
*  Oh my God, look at this country. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=307.79999999999995s)]
*  But it failed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=311.08s)]
*  We agree it failed. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  No, no, well, she didn't get elected. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=313.96s)]
*  I think there were bigger problems at play. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=315.8s)]
*  I think we helped to a very small degree. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=318.56s)]
*  So how do you feel about the fact that Donald Trump in 2024, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=320.68s)]
*  not only did he win more votes than he won in 2016 and 2020, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=324.08s)]
*  but he also won the popular vote for the first time. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a guy who was twice impeached, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=330.44s)]
*  multiple felony convictions, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=333.52s)]
*  incited insurrection in plain sight, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  found liable for sexual abuse. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=338.04s)]
*  This is not the 2016 apprentice Donald Trump, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=339.44s)]
*  ah, let's give him a chance to go burn it down. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=342.24s)]
*  We don't know much about him. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=344.44s)]
*  This is a decade in and he gets more votes than ever before. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  What do you think about the American public? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=349.0s)]
*  What do you think about the conservatives in America [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=350.2s)]
*  when you see that? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=351.76s)]
*  Oh, I blame the Democratic Party and I blame Joe Biden. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=352.59999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, Meti, the popular vote thing [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=355.0s)]
*  is freaking deceptive. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=357.2s)]
*  And I may be a rare conservative [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=358.88s)]
*  that would get rid of the electoral Congress [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=360.76s)]
*  because a lot of Democrats in blue states just stayed home. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=362.76s)]
*  So the popular vote doesn't matter. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=366.0s)]
*  That's deceptive. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=368.44s)]
*  Joe Biden, look, Kamala Harris made mistakes. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=369.68s)]
*  I think Joe Biden, I put the lion's share of blame on him. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=372.48s)]
*  A bitter, his bitter old ego kept him in way too long. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=375.72s)]
*  But the Democratic Party, Meti has problems. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=380.12s)]
*  We're living in a populous moment. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=382.92s)]
*  Average people are pissed off. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=384.88s)]
*  On one side, they see a demagogue who's telling them [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  brown and black people are a problem [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=390.40000000000003s)]
*  because they're eating your cats and dogs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=391.8s)]
*  On the other side, we have the Democrats [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  who are just ignoring these issues. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  So they went with the lion demagogue over the party [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=397.48s)]
*  that they told me, Meti, every day, wasn't listening to them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=400.44s)]
*  He obviously is not interested in democracy himself. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  And there will come a time, as we discussed a moment ago, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=407.88s)]
*  where he just completely ignores a major court ruling, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=410.32s)]
*  says out loud, I dare you to stop me, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=413.84s)]
*  which is what JD Vance in the past [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=416.2s)]
*  has encouraged him to do. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=417.56s)]
*  What happens then, Joe? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=419.12s)]
*  You're a former lawmaker. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=420.28s)]
*  What happens to America? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=421.96s)]
*  Should we be worried about political violence, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  civil war even? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=424.76s)]
*  Hell yes. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=426.28s)]
*  Look, I think when it warms up, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=428.32s)]
*  I think this summer's gonna be violent. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=430.48s)]
*  I think Americans are gonna take to the streets. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=432.52s)]
*  There's part of me that believes [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=434.68s)]
*  Trump wants Americans to take to the streets [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=436.32s)]
*  because Trump wants to use the military. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=438.48s)]
*  But he will defy court orders in a very public way. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=440.4s)]
*  And again, Congress won't do anything. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=443.24s)]
*  So then what happens? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  Congress then can issue contempt orders on Trump. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=446.52s)]
*  But then we're technically really [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=450.88s)]
*  in a constitutional crisis. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=452.8s)]
*  And I think then, look, if the courts right now [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  are overwhelmed, if we have a Congress that won't do squat, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=458.16s)]
*  again, we need an opposition party, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=463.16s)]
*  and I don't really see the opposition party. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=464.92s)]
*  The American people are gonna have to rise up. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=466.6s)]
*  The opposition party says, well, we don't have any leverage. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=467.8s)]
*  This is what Hakeem Jeffries says out loud. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=469.68s)]
*  We don't control the House, we don't control the Senate, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=470.68s)]
*  we don't have a majority on the Supreme Court. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=472.88s)]
*  What can we do, they say? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=474.6s)]
*  Yell and scream and keep Chuck Schumer away from the camera. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=475.92s)]
*  I love Hakeem Jeffries. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  But again, many they talk to us like, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=480.28000000000003s)]
*  Democrats talk to us like politicians. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  What was it, three, four weeks ago, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=485.6s)]
*  67 innocent people die in a plane crash in Washington, D.C. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=486.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's immediate reaction, cut through the bullshit, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=490.6s)]
*  was to blame brown and black air traffic controllers. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=494.6s)]
*  And Democrats responded to that by, oh, it's too early, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  oh, that's a little out there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=501.72s)]
*  We need to do this thing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=503.24s)]
*  They're playing by old rules still, a decade in. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=504.08000000000004s)]
*  Completely. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=505.88s)]
*  He's appointing Dan Bongino to be Deputy Director of the FBI, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=506.72s)]
*  and I don't hear much noise from Democrats about that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=510.0s)]
*  No, and Dan Bongino two days ago said, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=512.64s)]
*  Trump should defy court orders. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  He actually said that he should set up a courtroom [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  in the White House like Bane and Scarecrow in The Dark Knight, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=518.52s)]
*  who of course were the villains of that movie. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=522.44s)]
*  It's interesting that they're just openly saying, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=524.32s)]
*  we are villains. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=525.8000000000001s)]
*  I wish the Republican cavalry would be coming. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=527.5600000000001s)]
*  They're not coming. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=531.28s)]
*  I was Tea Party because of this. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=532.36s)]
*  I feared concentration of power. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=534.48s)]
*  Tea Party, they sold out a long time ago. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=537.52s)]
*  It's got to be... [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=539.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's not a way that the libertarian Republicans [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=540.28s)]
*  who claim to care about the Constitution... [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=541.76s)]
*  Mike Lee is the biggest toady out there. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=543.04s)]
*  Where are these people who claim to care about the Constitution, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=545.24s)]
*  the courts, separation of powers, small government, free speech? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=547.28s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  They're still in power. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=551.92s)]
*  And if they did what I did, they wouldn't be in power. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=553.28s)]
*  So there's your answer. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=555.4s)]
*  The Libertarian Party has become MAGA. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=556.2s)]
*  So this is why I jump on Democrats all the time, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  because they're the only shot we've got in opposition voice. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=561.36s)]
*  But they're utterly out of touch, and you said it, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=565.2s)]
*  they're playing by the old rules. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=567.12s)]
*  Again, during the campaign, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=568.4s)]
*  every time Trump speaks, he lies. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=569.88s)]
*  But he goes everywhere to lie. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=572.4s)]
*  The one criticism of Harris, Metty, was they tried to protect her, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=575.0s)]
*  played by the old rules, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=579.32s)]
*  get in front of the Washington Post, and they... [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=580.32s)]
*  Screw that! [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=582.24s)]
*  Get in front of you! [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=583.44s)]
*  Go on the Joe Rogan show. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=584.9200000000001s)]
*  Go everywhere. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=586.52s)]
*  But they need a community that can do that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think she would have done a good job on the Joe Rogan show. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=589.24s)]
*  The bigger issue is they didn't have a natural communicator. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=591.48s)]
*  They need that next time round in 2020. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=594.12s)]
*  It worries me, obviously, that you were so instantaneous to say, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=597.2s)]
*  hell, yes, when I said, do you worry about civil war? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=600.44s)]
*  That's quite a big statement. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=602.76s)]
*  Some people say that's hyperbole. It's alarmism. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=603.88s)]
*  A lot of Americans, you go outside the studio, streets of DC, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=606.4000000000001s)]
*  people just live in their lives, they're walking around fine. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=609.08s)]
*  They may not like Trump, they may think he's a buffoon, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=611.0400000000001s)]
*  they might be slightly worried about some of the stuff he did, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=613.36s)]
*  but most Americans are pretty complacent, I would argue. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=615.6800000000001s)]
*  The MAGA base, and I think your listeners need to hear this, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=619.64s)]
*  because I still engage with them every day, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=624.12s)]
*  they're welcoming violence. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=627.0s)]
*  Like, they want the left and Democrats and ordinary people to say, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=629.72s)]
*  this is crazy, let's take to the streets. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=633.48s)]
*  Trump wants violence. MAGA wants violence. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=636.28s)]
*  I just don't think the American people fully understand [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=640.72s)]
*  kind of this unprecedented moment we're in. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=643.56s)]
*  And of course, Trump remains pretty teflon. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=647.08s)]
*  We see this polling is bad. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=649.32s)]
*  I hear people saying, look how bad his polling is. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=650.76s)]
*  He's the most unpopular president at this point in his term, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=652.4s)]
*  but does it stop him from having momentum, leverage, power? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=655.76s)]
*  He survived so much. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=658.88s)]
*  I mean, he literally is the teflon politician of our time. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=660.6s)]
*  I mean, he survived convictions, he survived rape accusations, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=664.28s)]
*  he survived all sorts of things. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=667.6800000000001s)]
*  The Russia stuff was big in term one. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=670.4s)]
*  In some ways, I feel like it's coming back in term two. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=673.48s)]
*  It didn't really work for Democrats in term one. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  Now he's... [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=678.4s)]
*  Look, I'm no fan of Donald Trump's support for Vladimir Putin [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=679.64s)]
*  and selling out the Ukrainian people. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=682.4s)]
*  You wrote recently on your sub-stat [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=684.48s)]
*  that Donald Trump, quote, is a Russian asset. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=685.84s)]
*  Your words, Russian asset. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=688.36s)]
*  Like I said, I'm not a fan of his love into Putin. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=690.48s)]
*  Clearly there's something dodgy there. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=692.72s)]
*  But Russian asset, isn't that the same kind of, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  some would say over-the-top rhetoric, conspiratorial thinking [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=698.0s)]
*  that led Democrats and the hashtag resistance Twitter [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=702.4000000000001s)]
*  down a dead end during the first term? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=707.0s)]
*  It didn't get anywhere and Trump came out looking like [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=708.8800000000001s)]
*  the victim of a witch hunt. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=711.12s)]
*  This just pisses me off. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=713.52s)]
*  We find out a day or two ago that there's gonna be a book [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=715.52s)]
*  coming out in four months on the great cover-up, right? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=718.56s)]
*  On Joe Biden. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=721.12s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=722.56s)]
*  No one's ever written the book about the great cover-up of Trump. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=724.36s)]
*  Is he a Russian plant? Is he a Russian asset? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=727.88s)]
*  How come we don't know that? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=730.6s)]
*  A lot of people hear you say that, they just roll their eyes. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  Aren't you gonna lose a lot of people with that kind of language? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=734.4s)]
*  Everything he's done and said for 10 years [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=737.16s)]
*  is exactly what Putin would want him to do. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=739.8s)]
*  That's true. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=742.96s)]
*  So give me another explanation. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=743.96s)]
*  Don't just tell me he's a fanboy. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=745.96s)]
*  But, Mehdi, why hasn't anyone really looked into this? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=747.76s)]
*  People forget that the Mueller report was not a counterintelligence... [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=752.16s)]
*  No. No. ...investigation. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=755.16s)]
*  No. It was a criminal investigation. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=756.64s)]
*  Look, I just think the simplest answer is usually the best answer [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=758.88s)]
*  and it's right in front of us. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=762.96s)]
*  I've spoken to people in the know, as I know you have. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=765.48s)]
*  And damn near everyone I've spoken to who is familiar with the intelligence [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=769.12s)]
*  has said to me privately, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=775.12s)]
*  of course Trump is compromised by Putin. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=777.12s)]
*  Everyone has privately... People would say he's too chaotic [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=780.08s)]
*  and too ignorant and too narcissistic and too impetuous [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=782.36s)]
*  to be any kind of asset plant, Russian intelligence person. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=786.8000000000001s)]
*  That's all true. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=790.64s)]
*  But he also cares about money [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=792.1600000000001s)]
*  and he couldn't go anywhere on the planet to get money... [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  That's true. ...for a long period of history. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=797.2s)]
*  His son's bragged about it except for Russia. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=799.52s)]
*  I just think it... No, no. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=802.12s)]
*  Right, Mehdi, so this is really... [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=804.12s)]
*  The question is, come on, how do you beat Trump? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=805.5999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about the price of eggs, because now he owns it, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=808.4s)]
*  or do we keep talking about the rule of law and democracy? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=810.92s)]
*  You've got to talk about both. OK. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=814.52s)]
*  I think. All right, let's pivot a bit. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=816.76s)]
*  You have been an outspoken opponent of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  going as far as to call it a genocide. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=822.16s)]
*  But when it comes to Gaza, you've criticised people [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=824.64s)]
*  for calling Gaza a genocide. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=827.36s)]
*  Why is that, Joe? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=829.36s)]
*  Why is what's happening in Ukraine a genocide [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=830.6800000000001s)]
*  but not what's happening in Gaza, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=833.84s)]
*  when far more people have been killed and displaced in Gaza [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=835.36s)]
*  than in Ukraine? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfzsOCf-wuI&t=838.2s)]
