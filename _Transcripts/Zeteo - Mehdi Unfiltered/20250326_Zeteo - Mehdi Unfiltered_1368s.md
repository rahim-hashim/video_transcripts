Video Description: From the south of Gaza, *trauma surgeon Dr. Feroze Sidhwa and orthopedic surgeon Dr. Mark Perlmutter* huddle in front of their webcam at Nasser Hospital to describe the horrors they’ve witnessed over the last week since Israel broke the ceasefire.

_“We're losing friends all the time. We all have medical student friends that we befriended last year that are now dead,”_ Dr. Perlmutter tells Mehdi Hasan.

Dr. Sidhwa, meanwhile, had a closer-than-usual brush with death this week when an Israeli airstrike on the hospital killed his 17-year-old patient. He pointed out on Twitter how he could have been killed, too.

_“I got a call from the US Embassy after I sent out that tweet, because I think people saw it, and the lady said, ‘Hi, this is the embassy. We just want to make sure you're okay.’ And I was like, yeah, I'm fine. If you want to be sure I stay okay, maybe you could ask the Israelis not to bomb Nasser Hospital again, and I swear to God, she goes, ‘Actually, that's not our role, sorry.’”_

Watch the full interview to hear the heartbreaking stories that both doctors share with Mehdi, including how Dr. Perlmutter was forced to use a drill bit to fix a child’s fractured arm, and how Dr. Sidhwa treated a family attacked by an Israeli Apache helicopter. They also tackle the Israeli claim that fighters are hiding in Gaza’s hospitals.

# Israel Almost Killed This US Doctor. US Embassy Says It’s Not Their ‘Role’ to Protect Him
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI)
*  The last 10 days in the month of Ramadan are supposed to be the holiest of the year for Muslims around the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=0.0s)]
*  Sadly, however, that is not the case in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=5.2s)]
*  Instead of family gatherings and communal prayers, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=8.24s)]
*  Palestinians are searching for family members under the rubble again and praying at funerals. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=10.84s)]
*  Since breaking the ceasefire, Israel has killed more than 750 Palestinians. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=16.72s)]
*  And for those that survived the bombing, the shelling and the shootings, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=21.2s)]
*  Israel is making sure they have nowhere to go. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=24.64s)]
*  By bombing the one place they could think to go, the hospitals. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=26.84s)]
*  This has been a pattern for Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=31.04s)]
*  And that's not me saying it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=32.72s)]
*  That's the UN. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=33.88s)]
*  Yes, the United Nations last year accused Israel of displaying a pattern of attacks on Gaza hospitals [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=34.76s)]
*  after carrying out 136 strikes on at least 27 hospitals and 12 other medical facilities. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=40.08s)]
*  And that's just between October of 2023 and June of 2024. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=45.84s)]
*  Plenty more hospitals have been bombed since then, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=50.56s)]
*  the latest of which not only housed wounded Palestinians, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=53.24s)]
*  but also American doctors treating them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=56.48s)]
*  On Sunday, Israel bombed Gaza's Nasser Hospital, the largest medical facility in South Gaza, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=59.08s)]
*  killing at least two people and setting the second floor of the hospital's surgical wing on fire. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=64.24s)]
*  Israel says the strike targeted a Hamas leader getting treatment at the hospital, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=69.92s)]
*  which is such a brazen admission of guilt and a complete disregard for international law [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=74.0s)]
*  that need I remind you, international law explicitly states civilian hospitals [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=78.44s)]
*  organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=82.47999999999999s)]
*  may in no circumstances be the object of attack, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=86.28s)]
*  but shall at all times be respected and protected by the parties to the conflict. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=89.08s)]
*  The other victim of the strike, by the way, was a patient of one of the two American doctors [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=93.88s)]
*  currently at Nasser Hospital, California's Dr. Feroz Sidwer, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=97.48s)]
*  a trauma surgeon and North Carolina's Dr. Mark Perlmutter, an orthopedic surgeon. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=101.24000000000001s)]
*  Dr. Sidwer tweeted on the day of the attack saying, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=105.68s)]
*  I was at Nasser Hospital in Gaza when it was bombed today. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=108.16s)]
*  One of my patients, a 17-year-old boy, was killed. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=110.68s)]
*  He could have gone home tomorrow. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=113.8s)]
*  If I had been changing his dressings as I planned to this evening, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=115.48s)]
*  I probably would have been killed too. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=118.36s)]
*  Attacking hospitals is a war crime and it needs to stop. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=120.16s)]
*  Dr. Sidwer and Dr. Perlmutter join me now from Gaza. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=123.84s)]
*  My opening question is, guys, are you safe? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=127.48s)]
*  And I know that's a very relative term in Gaza right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=130.12s)]
*  As much as anybody else, I think. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=134.96s)]
*  We're not, I don't think we are. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=137.68s)]
*  I think and I hope that our presence here actually protects the Palestinians [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=140.32s)]
*  a little bit from attacks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=144.2s)]
*  You know, you're asking because on March 23rd, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=146.6s)]
*  the Israelis bombed the hospital that we're working at. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=149.76s)]
*  And, you know, I can't prove it, but I hope that they used a smaller [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=153.44s)]
*  ammunition because we're here instead of a larger one. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  If they wanted to destroy the whole hospital, since it doesn't seem [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  anybody cares that they bombed the hospital, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=164.32s)]
*  maybe they would have used a larger one, killed a bunch of internationals. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  It just looks bad for them. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  So maybe we're keeping other people safe by being. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=171.76s)]
*  Right. And certainly their ability to target cell phones, even when they're off [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=174.28s)]
*  and and and send a president your way, whenever they wish to, is Israel. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  So I don't feel threatened while I'm here. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=184.28s)]
*  Really at all. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  But having said that, Israel certainly declared its ability to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=188.72s)]
*  attempt to assassinate innocent health care [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=193.68s)]
*  and other peacekeeping forces like the UN last week. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=196.68s)]
*  In a safe house. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  And for, as you mentioned, the strike on the hospital on the 23rd, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=203.12s)]
*  you tweeted about how you were dealing with a patient there who was killed. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  Walk us through if it's not too painful for you, walk us through [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=210.84s)]
*  what happened that day and what your experience was. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's so, yeah, so it was it was, I don't know, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=217.68s)]
*  probably eight o'clock at eight thirty at night. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=221.28s)]
*  And I can't remember exactly. But but yeah, no, I had the 16 year old boy [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=223.44s)]
*  who was killed, Ibrahim Barham. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=228.32s)]
*  He was my patient. I took care of him on March 18th [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  when he was wounded in his tent in the Mwasi. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=232.12s)]
*  And I repaired his colon, gave him a colostomy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=234.68s)]
*  And he was actually he would have gone home yesterday, the day after the bombing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=238.48s)]
*  But yes, I was on my way down to the to the men's surgical ward, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=243.28s)]
*  which is on the second floor, to change his dressings and just talk to his family [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=246.16s)]
*  and tell him he's OK to go home tomorrow. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=249.92s)]
*  Don't worry, everything will be fine. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  But the there's a doctor here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  I think her name is Dr. Hebe. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=256.2s)]
*  She she just pulled me into the ICU and said, hey, there's a guy who's bleeding over here. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=258.0s)]
*  Can you can you just take a look at him? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=261.59999999999997s)]
*  So we looked at him. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=263.4s)]
*  We decided we were going to take him to the operating room. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=264.52s)]
*  And that took like 10 or 15 minutes. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=266.64s)]
*  And then that's when the bomb hit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=268.88s)]
*  So I was like walking out of the ICU when the bomb exploded. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  But I would have been in the surgical ward, standing right next to him, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  changing his bandages and talking to him and his family when the bomb hit. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=275.24s)]
*  So, you know, I. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=279.32s)]
*  If it's a little weird for sure. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=285.2s)]
*  Mark, if if if Farros had been killed, God forbid, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=287.96s)]
*  do you think that would have made any difference? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  Either the US government would have cared that the US doctor just got blown up [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=293.64s)]
*  by an Israeli strike. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=296.08s)]
*  Congressman Darrell Issa, who provided me his cell phone number [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=318.08s)]
*  several months ago to [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=322.35999999999996s)]
*  to gain advice on [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=324.56s)]
*  a potential solution. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=327.52s)]
*  He's been blowing me off ever since. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=328.96s)]
*  But I texted him and said Americans could be dying. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  Certainly, there's foreign nationals from probably 15 countries [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  within 20 yards of us right now. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  And they're at risk. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=344.96s)]
*  Could you please do something to stop it? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=347.6s)]
*  And he hasn't responded at all. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=349.64000000000004s)]
*  He has responded earlier this week, so he's getting my messages [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  and he gave me a read receipt. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=354.56s)]
*  Just doesn't give a shit. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  The bottom line is, our Congress doesn't care. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=359.6s)]
*  I would have lost one of my best friends and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  and we would have kept on working because that's what Farros would have wanted us to do. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=365.24s)]
*  But and that's what we're here for. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=370.0s)]
*  But we're losing friends all the time. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=373.0s)]
*  We all have medical student friends that we befriended last year that are now dead. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=374.84s)]
*  And the targeting of health care workers is nothing that's new, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=380.44s)]
*  but it's not our problem. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=385.64s)]
*  The real issue is what's happening to health care workers within Gaza. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes, there's still 350 health care workers imprisoned in Israel. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=390.84s)]
*  Israel bemoans their their own hostages, but they don't give a hoot about the 10,000 [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=396.55999999999995s)]
*  prisoners that they took. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  We call them prisoners on this side of the border. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=404.24s)]
*  They're hostages on the other side, but they're the same. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=406.44s)]
*  They're all absconded with without committing any crimes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  I have an orthopedic surgeon colleague here who was [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=412.52s)]
*  taken out of the operating room. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=416.84000000000003s)]
*  His fingers were crushed. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=418.2s)]
*  They showed him a picture of his wife from a spy, not not from a magazine [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=420.68s)]
*  or an old photo, and had a metadata and said it was taken the day before [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=424.92s)]
*  up close and said, we're going to bring her here in front of you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=430.72s)]
*  And we're going to gang rape her in front of you if you don't admit that you're Hamas [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=433.88s)]
*  or we'll keep breaking your fingers. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=437.64s)]
*  He still didn't admit he was a mas. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=439.88s)]
*  And they said, well, then we're going to send a drone through your bedroom window [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=441.56s)]
*  and incinerate your children. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=444.88s)]
*  And he still wouldn't admit he was Hamas. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=446.0s)]
*  They beat him every time he asked to speak to a lawyer and beat him twice as hard [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=448.08s)]
*  when they after he spoke to his lawyer. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=451.6s)]
*  And he spent 11 months in prison, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=454.24s)]
*  having troops inserted up his rectum by by female [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=456.92s)]
*  IDS members who said that were the probe was soaked in pork blood. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=461.08000000000004s)]
*  Any way that you can psychologically destroy a human being. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=467.6s)]
*  They did in that prison. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=471.8s)]
*  And that that story was absolutely repeated [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  by the chief of the nursing department here and by multiple health care workers. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=475.92s)]
*  It's not an isolated event. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=480.04s)]
*  And that story was repeated in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=481.8s)]
*  in a hospital where I spent five days north of here. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  And just yesterday, the chief of the surgery department, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=489.32s)]
*  orthopedic surgery department, received a telephone call from the IDF [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=493.2s)]
*  saying that your wife works for the UN as a dentist. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=496.64s)]
*  And because she works for the UN, you must evacuate. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=501.32s)]
*  So they're over at the Mawasi now living in a tent with 50 other people, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=504.2s)]
*  a tent built for 20 with one toilet. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=508.52s)]
*  And they had five minutes to get out of their house. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=512.96s)]
*  They were given five minutes. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=516.08s)]
*  I got a I got a call from the US Embassy [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=518.16s)]
*  after I sent out that tweet, because I think I think people saw it. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=521.52s)]
*  And the lady said, hi, this is the embassy. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=525.2s)]
*  We just want to make sure you're OK. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=528.04s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, I'm fine. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=529.44s)]
*  If you want to make sure I stay OK, maybe you could ask the Israelis [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=532.2s)]
*  not to bomb Nasser Hospital again. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=534.88s)]
*  And I swear to God, I'm making this up. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=536.72s)]
*  She goes, actually, that's not our role. Sorry. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=538.36s)]
*  It's like, well, you know, the calling me to make to ask if I'm alive, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=541.68s)]
*  if I'm dead, doesn't you know, you'll only find out. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=544.84s)]
*  This is the US Embassy in Israel. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=547.56s)]
*  Well, this is I mean, yeah, it was a 972 number. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=549.04s)]
*  So that's what I'm assuming. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=552.28s)]
*  And she said I'm from the embassy. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=553.6s)]
*  I don't see why someone would make that up. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=554.8s)]
*  But the yeah, that was that was that was wild. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=557.2s)]
*  And that parallels their behavior last year when we were here [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=559.6s)]
*  in the World Central Kitchen vans were bombed. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=562.44s)]
*  Yes. Those volunteers were killed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=564.56s)]
*  I emailed the embassy four times, got read receipts that thank you [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=567.44s)]
*  for emailing us. We'll get back to you right away. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=571.72s)]
*  Never heard back. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=574.12s)]
*  I called them called Chuck Schumer's office, spoke to his secretary four times [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=574.84s)]
*  being the ranking Jew amongst us. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=580.52s)]
*  And and his office never responded back. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=582.48s)]
*  So the amount of feedback. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=587.12s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=589.9200000000001s)]
*  So I was going to I was going to ask you mentioned earlier the H word. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=590.5600000000001s)]
*  And for us, I thought I'd ask you this. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=594.52s)]
*  Mark mentioned Hamas, right? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=595.9200000000001s)]
*  That is the be all end all for the Israelis, apparently. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=597.84s)]
*  So they claim if you say to someone here in the West in America, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=600.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, if I say the Israelis bombed the hospital [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=604.68s)]
*  in which two American doctors were at, you know, the response will come back. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=607.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, Hamas, we're using the hospital to hide in. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=610.64s)]
*  Hamas have turned the hospital into a military base. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=613.5999999999999s)]
*  You are in the hospital. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=616.3599999999999s)]
*  What is the role of Hamas in the Nasser Hospital for us? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=617.68s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two things. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=621.56s)]
*  One is actually I guess it's the same thing. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=623.0s)]
*  Number one, I would I did not to contradict you, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=626.4799999999999s)]
*  but I would say it's not just Israel, but it's the US and Israel. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=628.92s)]
*  Yes, this this excuse is used for constantly and Britain, too. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  Sure. It's just absurd. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=635.0s)]
*  But number two, wounded combatants are actually protected people [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=637.52s)]
*  under international law. There's no debate about this. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=641.92s)]
*  Nobody claims otherwise. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=644.28s)]
*  Now, so the so that's that's off the table. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=645.92s)]
*  You don't get to just kill people because they went to seek medical care. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=648.28s)]
*  And you certainly don't disrupt the hospital for that. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=651.36s)]
*  The original, you know, the original Geneva Convention in 1864 [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=653.68s)]
*  is about actually the protection of wounded combatants, not civilians. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=657.36s)]
*  Just saying that people who are wounded and are no longer [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=661.36s)]
*  participating in combat have the right to receive health care [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=663.56s)]
*  and not to be mistreated and certainly not to be murdered. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=666.24s)]
*  So that's that's number one. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=669.12s)]
*  Number two, we all every hospital or every room in this hospital is unlocked. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=670.3199999999999s)]
*  Everybody can walk in anywhere. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=675.3199999999999s)]
*  And there's there are no fighters or any such things going on here. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=677.56s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=680.88s)]
*  But the but you know, just so just just to illustrate how crazy this [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=682.52s)]
*  this this killing is, it Benjamin Netanyahu had his prostate removed [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=686.24s)]
*  on I think it was December 27th or 26th, late December last year. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=690.96s)]
*  And he was in the hospital for a few days. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=695.48s)]
*  Now, I have absolutely no doubt that from his hospital room, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=697.48s)]
*  he was coordinating the war effort once he woke up from anesthesia. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=700.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm sure he was. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=703.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, he stands very credibly accused of genocide and extermination [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=704.88s)]
*  and starvation and all sorts of other heinous crimes. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=708.32s)]
*  Does anyone think Hamas could just bomb the hospital that he's in? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=711.0s)]
*  Or forget that. Suppose they didn't kill anyone else. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  Suppose Hamas just sent one guy to fire one bullet at Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=715.96s)]
*  Well, it would have been a nuclear war after that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=720.6s)]
*  Everybody would have said it because that is criminal. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=722.28s)]
*  You don't kill people in hospitals. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=724.28s)]
*  That's just the the all and end all of it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=725.84s)]
*  You don't do that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=727.92s)]
*  Even though, like I said, I'm sure Netanyahu was participating [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=729.04s)]
*  in the Israeli war effort from his hospital room. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=732.4399999999999s)]
*  It's not it's not what that's not what's done. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=734.84s)]
*  Well, what is the situation in Nassau Hospital right now? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=737.16s)]
*  We're reading about the Israelis having blockaded aid going in supplies [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=739.24s)]
*  going in the ceasefire is obviously over if it ever existed. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=743.24s)]
*  What is the situation in terms of Nassau [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=746.4s)]
*  Hospital's ability to treat people right now? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=748.12s)]
*  Remarkably compromised. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=751.8s)]
*  I just came from a Laksa Hospital [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=753.16s)]
*  where I had to wash my hands and tap water before surgery, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=755.6s)]
*  and I would clean the patient's arm before I repaired a broken [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=758.92s)]
*  elbow on a baby with tap water. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=763.8s)]
*  They received no antibiotics [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=767.84s)]
*  and their supplies are as bad as they were a year ago [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=770.32s)]
*  when we were here and when the border was opened. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=775.92s)]
*  Now there's a blockade and the supplies are dwindling rapidly. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=779.44s)]
*  That's the smallest hospital of the three of the 30 some that were initially [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=784.84s)]
*  present here. That's the smallest of the three that are remaining. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=789.36s)]
*  There's only three. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=792.88s)]
*  There's a tremendous decrease in the number of ability [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=794.08s)]
*  or facilities that can provide care. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=797.24s)]
*  And this is probably the largest remaining. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=798.92s)]
*  This is the largest in terms of bed capacity that actually exists. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=802.4000000000001s)]
*  This is the biggest hospital in Gaza right now. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=806.08s)]
*  And and so this hospital probably has my best guess would be a week. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=808.0s)]
*  Would you agree? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=812.36s)]
*  It's it's it's hard to know is in terms of lifesaving, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=813.36s)]
*  like hemorrhage control operations that we can do. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=817.08s)]
*  If you're bleeding to death, how to stop the bleeding. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=819.96s)]
*  We have what we need to do that at the moment. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=822.48s)]
*  But like actually just over my right shoulder, I don't know if it's visible. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=825.4000000000001s)]
*  It's that building right there with the burned floor. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=827.84s)]
*  That's the hospital's old warehouse. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=830.32s)]
*  It was a dialysis center on the bottom and the warehouse was the third floor. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=832.36s)]
*  The Israelis came in there. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=835.72s)]
*  They raided this hospital a year ago in February and March. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=837.24s)]
*  They searched it. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=839.76s)]
*  They found only equipment for building a new operative room, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=840.48s)]
*  and then they torched the place. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=842.88s)]
*  So if you can hear the warplane going overhead, but the then then they torched [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=844.32s)]
*  the place. So the so yeah, you know, if you so this hospital doesn't even [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=848.44s)]
*  have the capacity to keep a strategic reserve of surgical supplies, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=853.1600000000001s)]
*  of antibiotics, things like that. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=857.0s)]
*  So if we keep getting mass casualty events like we've been getting [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=858.6800000000001s)]
*  since the 18th, there's no way we have the capacity to keep dealing with it, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=861.52s)]
*  even just to control hemorrhage, which means people will die needlessly. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=866.28s)]
*  And then to add to that, just a scooch. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=869.88s)]
*  When an orthopod fixes a fracture, we drill a hole in a bone [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=872.4s)]
*  and then put a screw into that hole, whether it's through a plate [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=876.64s)]
*  or through the fracture line. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=880.04s)]
*  Or we use pins. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=882.76s)]
*  We have no plates in Al-Aqsa hospital. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=884.56s)]
*  We had no screws. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=886.6s)]
*  So I use drill bits. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=888.88s)]
*  So the device we use to make the hole to put the screw in. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=890.24s)]
*  I kept the drill bits in the patient because that's the only metallic device [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=894.12s)]
*  that would fit in a drill that I could hold an elbow fracture. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=898.2s)]
*  This was this was a child, Mark? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=901.48s)]
*  About four months old. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=904.52s)]
*  You put a drill bit into a fracture of a four month old Palestinian child in Gaza. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=906.84s)]
*  Right. Well, normally I would put pins in. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=913.0s)]
*  The drill bit was a little bit bigger than the pins. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=914.76s)]
*  But the point is, we have no pins. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=917.48s)]
*  The standard basic element of orthopedic care is a metallic pin, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=920.6800000000001s)]
*  a stainless steel pin. They don't exist. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=925.84s)]
*  And that's not a fancy thing. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=928.08s)]
*  It's in any third world hospital. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=929.6800000000001s)]
*  You you you both know in the past, let me ask you this. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=931.28s)]
*  You both, for as you wrote a piece for The New York Times, which caused uproar. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=934.0s)]
*  The Times had to come out and defend your op ed [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=938.04s)]
*  when you showed the images of children being shot. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=940.52s)]
*  Mark, you did it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=944.08s)]
*  A now famous interview with 60 Minutes, where you talked about snipers [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=945.32s)]
*  shooting at children right now. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=948.8s)]
*  Are you you know, this is not your first time in Gaza. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  You're back in Gaza. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=953.88s)]
*  Are you still seeing evidence of children being targeted by Israeli forces? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=955.16s)]
*  So I haven't I actually haven't seen any children come in with single gunshot [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=961.28s)]
*  wounds to the head at Nasser since the since the the 18th [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=965.4s)]
*  or actually since I've been here. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  Thank God. But the we despite that, you know, we focused on the shooting [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=971.92s)]
*  of children with single gunshot wounds to the head and chest in that [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=977.04s)]
*  or I focus on that on The New York Times article precisely because it shows [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=980.4s)]
*  what the Israeli attack is. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=984.36s)]
*  It's not possible to explain that away [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=985.8s)]
*  by saying their collateral damage, you know, like one kid, maybe two kids, maybe. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=988.92s)]
*  But in the in the Kashmir area of every hospital in Gaza for a year. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=992.68s)]
*  No, that doesn't make any sense, obviously. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=996.48s)]
*  But the but that that wasn't to I think sometimes people get distracted [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=999.28s)]
*  and think that that's how people that's how children are being killed. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1004.2s)]
*  No, kids are being killed in Gaza the same way everyone else is by getting blown up. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1007.08s)]
*  That's the vast majority of injuries. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1010.72s)]
*  And right now, just as just when like when we were here last year, 40 to 50 [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1012.76s)]
*  percent of the of the casualties we're seeing and most of the severely [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1017.1600000000001s)]
*  injured casualties are kids. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1020.88s)]
*  It's mostly with shrapnel injuries and explosions, you know, like [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1022.96s)]
*  like just the last night, maybe starting at [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1026.52s)]
*  the middle, it was about midnight, actually, when I went down to the ER, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1030.72s)]
*  there was an Apache helicopter gunship attack on apparently just a few blocks [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1034.4s)]
*  that way. And I don't know if it was on a car or a building or what. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1037.88s)]
*  But the one man and several sort of one man and four children came in for that [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1041.72s)]
*  incident. A 10 year old girl who probably is going to lose at least two of her limbs, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1046.96s)]
*  if not three in the end. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1052.8s)]
*  And then a two, four or five year old kid boys, I'm not sure exactly how old they were. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1055.48s)]
*  The first came in with a devastating brain injury. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1060.24s)]
*  He was still breathing, actually, but we don't have a neurosurgeon here and we don't [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1062.32s)]
*  have the capacity to take care of a child that sick. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1065.08s)]
*  So we just had to tell you he was just he had agonal breathing, which means he was [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1067.48s)]
*  just a few moments away from dying. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1070.2s)]
*  We told his dad to pick him up and take him over to the area where dead kids are [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1071.92s)]
*  allowed to die with their families. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1075.1200000000001s)]
*  That's a real thing in the emergency room here. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1076.28s)]
*  And then the next kid that came in, also four or five years old, also had a [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1078.96s)]
*  devastating brain injury. He was eviscerated, meaning his eyes, intestines [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1082.24s)]
*  were on his outside because his abdomen torn open. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1085.52s)]
*  And we had to tell him his his family the exact same thing. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1089.16s)]
*  And all a man came in [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1093.28s)]
*  with these huge wounds on his legs and his buttocks, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1095.8400000000001s)]
*  whether he was the target of the attack, I have no idea. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1100.5600000000002s)]
*  But I know he was the father of the little girl that I just talked about, who's [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1102.64s)]
*  probably going to lose who could conceivably lose three out of her four limbs. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1105.68s)]
*  And he died this morning [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  from from blood loss and maybe maybe from what's called a call to fat. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1112.24s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1115.72s)]
*  So the so, yeah, we're still seeing, honestly, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1117.52s)]
*  half if not more children who are injured. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1120.92s)]
*  And whether the Israelis are targeting them on purpose [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1123.92s)]
*  or just killing them as carelessly as when I step on ants, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1126.52s)]
*  I don't know, but it doesn't really make a difference. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1129.92s)]
*  Well, the night before I came back to this hospital, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1131.68s)]
*  there was a 15 year old girl riding her boy, I'm sorry, riding his bicycle [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1134.84s)]
*  and Apache gunship [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1139.56s)]
*  shot at him. And and we amputated [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1142.44s)]
*  one leg, the foot off the other leg. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1145.96s)]
*  And the next morning we spent probably six hours [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1148.88s)]
*  trying to repair nerves and the break the artery in his upper arm. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1152.84s)]
*  And the next morning his hand was black. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1157.36s)]
*  It wasn't successful. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1159.24s)]
*  And so he literally lost three extremities. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1162.32s)]
*  And this is a 15 year old just riding his bike. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1165.16s)]
*  Terrific. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1167.6s)]
*  Mark, I want to ask one last question to you before I let you both go, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1168.44s)]
*  which is right now in the US, as I'm sure you're following [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1171.52s)]
*  the Trump administration is cracking down on protesters, on students, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1174.52s)]
*  on pro-Palestinian organizers, and they're doing it in the name [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1178.8s)]
*  of fighting anti-Semitism to the point where the White House [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1182.6s)]
*  detained Mahmoud Khalil of Columbia University and used the phrase [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1186.4799999999998s)]
*  Shalom Mahmoud. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1189.9599999999998s)]
*  You are a Jewish doctor who has gone out to Gaza. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1192.0s)]
*  What do you make of what the Trump administration is doing right now? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1194.76s)]
*  It's only about money. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1198.4799999999998s)]
*  Trump can say to Columbia University, I'll withhold [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1200.56s)]
*  400 million dollars from you if you don't play my game. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1202.8s)]
*  And Columbia only cares about money. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1206.04s)]
*  It's the same institution that fired or [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1207.96s)]
*  expelled a graduate student in 1936 for anti-Nazi protests. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1212.08s)]
*  So when the Nazi party had the same exact presence [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1217.68s)]
*  and donation patterns as the APEC does now, it's only about money. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1221.56s)]
*  Trump's not making a decision because he's pro-Israel, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1228.6399999999999s)]
*  he's making a decision because Israel gives them money [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1232.52s)]
*  vis-a-vis the AIPAC and perhaps Christian Zionists. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1235.8799999999999s)]
*  And Farrokh's last question to you. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1240.56s)]
*  Obviously, a lot of Muslims are being targeted here in the US now [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1242.48s)]
*  for quote unquote pro-Palestinian activities. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1245.36s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen to people like yourself [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1248.2s)]
*  when you head back to the US? This isn't your first trip to Gaza. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1250.44s)]
*  What do you think the reaction will be when you head back home? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1253.68s)]
*  I don't know. Actually, I'm not Muslim. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1258.08s)]
*  I don't know that the government will care about that. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1259.72s)]
*  You're a brown guy with a foreign sounding lane. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1262.76s)]
*  Let me rephrase it. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1264.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1265.1599999999999s)]
*  So I doubt they'll... [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1267.76s)]
*  I think when I say I'm Zoroastrian, they'll say gay. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1269.7199999999998s)]
*  But yeah, no, it's... [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1274.4399999999998s)]
*  I do worry about that. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1276.2399999999998s)]
*  But in the end, I don't want... [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1278.56s)]
*  The American Association of University Professors has put out a statement [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1283.0s)]
*  saying that universities shouldn't engage in what's called anticipatory obedience. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1285.9599999999998s)]
*  Like Mark, I think, implied that Colombia is doing. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1290.4s)]
*  And other plans, certainly not just Colombia. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1294.1200000000001s)]
*  Plenty of universities are doing this, unfortunately. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1295.96s)]
*  And I'm not going to do that. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1299.2s)]
*  If I haven't done anything illegal, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1301.28s)]
*  I've only fulfilled the professional mandate that my profession requires. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1304.64s)]
*  I took an oath to help people. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1309.04s)]
*  I didn't take an oath to say I'd help everybody unless they're a wounded [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1311.64s)]
*  Hamas combatant or some other nonsense. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1314.96s)]
*  Anybody who comes into this hospital, they can be an Israeli soldier. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1316.84s)]
*  I don't care. Yeah, I just don't care. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1320.04s)]
*  I help people who need help. That's my job. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1322.12s)]
*  I stop people from bleeding to death. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1324.32s)]
*  I don't care what they look like or what they believe. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1325.76s)]
*  So I'll just keep doing that. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1329.12s)]
*  And if I end up in a quantifiable pair or something, that sucks. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1330.68s)]
*  But I guess I'll help people down there, too. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1334.9199999999998s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1337.24s)]
*  Feroz, Mark, we appreciate you both. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1338.1599999999999s)]
*  Please do stay safe and we hope we can stay in touch. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1340.6s)]
*  And I'm sure above all our viewers, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1343.08s)]
*  we thank you for all your work out there. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1345.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1347.6s)]
*  Thank you, guys. Thank you. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuhOgXIkjI&t=1349.6799999999998s)]
