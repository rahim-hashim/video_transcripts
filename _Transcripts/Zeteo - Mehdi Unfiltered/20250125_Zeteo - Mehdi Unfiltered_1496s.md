Video Description: ‘I was very vocal in my support of a ceasefire. I have been very vocal of my belief that Joe Biden should have used much more leverage. I'm not sure it ever would have worked. I think Benjamin Netanyahu made a decision early on that he was going to only deliver a ceasefire deal to Donald Trump.’

Watch Democratic Senator Chris Murphy and Mehdi have a heated debate about the ceasefire in Gaza, the ban on TikTok, Elon Musk’s salute, and of course Trump and his billionaire administration.

# ‘We're Not Responsible For Anything Hamas Does.’ - Mehdi to Democratic Senator on Arming Israel
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [January 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U)
*  We are just days into Donald Trump's second presidency, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=0.0s)]
*  and while he and the Republican Party [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=2.9s)]
*  are quickly implementing a MAGA agenda that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=4.3s)]
*  is even more authoritarian and dangerous than what [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=6.8s)]
*  we saw in his first term, Democrats [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=8.78s)]
*  in the midst of their post-election blame game [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=11.28s)]
*  have still yet to deliver a clear path forward [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=13.64s)]
*  on how to fight back against Trump and rebuild their party. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=16.12s)]
*  In fact, the Democrats' favorability ratings [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=19.52s)]
*  are now hitting an all-time low, with a new CNN poll [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=21.26s)]
*  showing them at just 33%. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=23.86s)]
*  On top of that, the poll also found [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=26.26s)]
*  that 58% of Democrat voters saying, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=27.68s)]
*  the party needs to make major changes or reform entirely. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Now, unsurprisingly, a lot of the establishment Democrats [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=33.72s)]
*  want to stick to the status quo, stick to the same old responses, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=39.900000000000006s)]
*  that the party should focus on bipartisan legislation, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=41.96s)]
*  which some might say is rolling over [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=45.34s)]
*  for the Republicans yet again. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=46.94s)]
*  But other Senate Democrats have suggested [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=49.2s)]
*  a more robust reform, including a, quote, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=50.84s)]
*  firm break with neoliberalism. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=53.64s)]
*  Yes, those are the words used by Connecticut senators. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  Chris Murphy, after the Democrats' defeat in November, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=58.64s)]
*  has he described how the, quote, wreckage of neoliberalism [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=61.44s)]
*  has left legions of Americans adrift. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=64.18s)]
*  He also criticized Democrats for refusing to pick a fight [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=66.44s)]
*  with billionaires and corporations, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=68.82s)]
*  sounding less like a party moderate [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=71.32s)]
*  and more like Bernie Sanders. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=73.48s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss those comments, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=75.18s)]
*  discuss the new Trump administration [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=76.76s)]
*  and what these next four years might look like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=78.76s)]
*  is none other than that senator himself. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=80.32s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy, thank you for joining me [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  here in the studio. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=84.16s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=85.06s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=85.97999999999999s)]
*  Let's jump straight into it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=86.77999999999999s)]
*  You've got to start with Elon Musk. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=88.61999999999999s)]
*  Sadly, I wish we didn't. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=90.25999999999999s)]
*  And that salute. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=91.96s)]
*  You asked Trump's candidate for UN Ambassador Lee [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  Stefanik this week, quote, what do you [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=95.36s)]
*  think of Elon Musk doing two Heil Hitler [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  salutes at the president's rally? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  She, of course, refused to accept [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=101.66s)]
*  it was a Heil Hitler salute. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=103.1s)]
*  Musk has suggested they weren't Nazi salutes. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=104.5s)]
*  You think they are. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  I think they are. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=107.89999999999999s)]
*  What does he? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=109.78s)]
*  My question, then, is what do you make of those two Heil [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=111.38s)]
*  Hitler salutes? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=115.02s)]
*  What do they make Musk? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=116.02s)]
*  Like, he's all very well saying, OK, he did a Nazi salute. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=117.41999999999999s)]
*  Let's say he did. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=119.78s)]
*  What does that make Musk? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=121.02s)]
*  Does that make Musk a Nazi? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=122.02s)]
*  Does that make him a Nazi sympathizer? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=123.05999999999999s)]
*  What are the consequences of that? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  I mean, listen, maybe you could excuse that gesture [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=126.66s)]
*  if it wasn't coming from somebody who [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=129.95999999999998s)]
*  has a consistent history of identifying themselves [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  with neo-Nazis and with anti-Semitic conspiracy [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=136.14s)]
*  theories. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=139.38s)]
*  He literally amplifies some of the most vicious anti-Semitic [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=140.57999999999998s)]
*  conspiracy theories on Twitter. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=144.02s)]
*  He just endorsed the far-right, essentially neo-Nazi party [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=146.06s)]
*  in Germany. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=149.74s)]
*  And so when that guy does something [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=150.84s)]
*  that looks suspiciously identical to the Nazi salute, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=153.64s)]
*  you might come to the conclusion that it is. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=157.84s)]
*  And listen, what I think is so dangerous [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=160.44s)]
*  about this broader moment is that there [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=162.52s)]
*  are these signals being sent to really dangerous, fringe, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=165.02s)]
*  violent groups on the right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=169.82s)]
*  Fringe right groups, white supremacists, neo-Nazis, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=172.12s)]
*  that Trump's with you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=175.68s)]
*  The pardons, essentially, were a message [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=176.88s)]
*  that there is immunity for political violence. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=180.16s)]
*  And all throughout Telegram and far-right channels [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=182.96s)]
*  on Monday night, that Musk neo-Nazi salute [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=186.9s)]
*  was being amplified as evidence. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=190.96s)]
*  Nick Fuentes thinks it was a Nazi salute. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=193.1s)]
*  I mean, Proud Boys, other groups saying, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=195.1s)]
*  Trump's got our back, right? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=198.34s)]
*  The white supremacy cause is back in vogue. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=200.06s)]
*  And that makes for an explosive moment, politically [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=205.04s)]
*  and physically, in our political space right now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=213.04s)]
*  How dare you accuse a top advisor to the president [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=214.14s)]
*  of doing a Nazi salute, the president who then pardoned [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=216.54s)]
*  a guy in a Camp Auschwitz t-shirt. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  Let me ask you this, Senator. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=220.88s)]
*  Is Elon Musk the shadow president of the United States, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=222.17999999999998s)]
*  in your view? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=224.16s)]
*  And if so, what does that say about the state [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=225.16s)]
*  of American democracy, or should we say, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=226.56s)]
*  American oligarchy? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=228.26s)]
*  Well, I think it's clear that a handful of billionaires [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=230.06s)]
*  are in charge. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=232.5s)]
*  Elon Musk certainly has the most influence. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=233.7s)]
*  But right now, Donald Trump has made it clear [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=237.0s)]
*  that he is doing the work of the richest five or six [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=239.1s)]
*  men in the world. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=244.14s)]
*  And it is not coincidental to the fact [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=245.82s)]
*  that they control major information companies, right? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=247.82s)]
*  Because the way that you seize power permanently [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  is a pretty well-troddened path for autocrats that start out [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  as elected leaders. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=263.5s)]
*  And one of the key first moves is to seize control, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  take control, create some kind of relationship [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=268.24s)]
*  between government and private sector in the information [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=271.24s)]
*  space. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=273.14s)]
*  And that's what he has done. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=274.14s)]
*  Through his alliance with Elon Musk, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=275.44s)]
*  through his courting and threatening of people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=276.98s)]
*  like Jeff Zuckerberg, through his suggestion [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=280.18s)]
*  that the government take a 50% stake in TikTok, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=282.12s)]
*  all of a sudden, he has the ability [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=285.3s)]
*  for those big information platforms [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=287.76s)]
*  to suppress dissent and amplify his content. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=289.9s)]
*  And so it's not coincidental that the billionaires he [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=293.3s)]
*  is identifying with are the folks who [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=296.2s)]
*  can help assure that he stays, or his family, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=298.38s)]
*  or his interests stay in power. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=302.08s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't have the Wall Street guys [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=303.48s)]
*  or the fossil fuel guys on stage. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  There were like a couple of them, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=306.48s)]
*  but they were further back in the days. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=307.58s)]
*  Yeah, the comms guys. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=309.12s)]
*  So you have the three richest men in the world, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=310.32s)]
*  Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk, with better seats [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=312.02s)]
*  than the Trump cabinet members at the inauguration. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=314.18s)]
*  You have Joe Biden slamming oligarchy [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=316.92s)]
*  in his farewell address on his way out the door. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=319.1s)]
*  What do you say to critics, Senator, who point to the fact [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=321.5s)]
*  that the 100 wealthiest Americans got more than $1.5 [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  trillion richer over the last four years on Joe Biden's, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=327.84000000000003s)]
*  not Donald Trump's watch, on the Democrats' watch, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=331.58000000000004s)]
*  that Joe Biden himself gave billionaire mega [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  donor George Soros the Presidential Medal of Freedom [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=336.1s)]
*  just two weeks ago? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  So Joe Biden began the work of breaking up [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  these big corporations, breaking up these big monopolies. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=342.98s)]
*  He's responsible for a piece of legislation [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=346.58000000000004s)]
*  that guarantees every corporation in this country [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  pay at least 15% in corporate taxes. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=351.22s)]
*  Back before Joe Biden, the biggest companies paid zero. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=353.92s)]
*  But of course, that transition to a fairer economy [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=357.26s)]
*  doesn't happen in four years. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=359.82s)]
*  Yes, I am broadly a critic of a Democratic Party [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=362.32s)]
*  that I think has not been aggressive enough [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=366.5s)]
*  in breaking up concentrated power. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=368.70000000000005s)]
*  Do I think Kamala Harris should have run? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=370.6s)]
*  Should that have been a more nakedly populist campaign? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=372.8s)]
*  Should that have been the tent pole rather than democracy? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=376.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=378.56s)]
*  But I frankly don't apologize for what Joe Biden did. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=379.86s)]
*  We saw health and life breathe back into our antitrust [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=384.6s)]
*  operations. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=391.6s)]
*  Corporations started to pay their fair share. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=392.78000000000003s)]
*  Industrial policies started to become a conversation again. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=394.44s)]
*  So he didn't get all the way there, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=397.48s)]
*  but he was a much more consequential president [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=399.38s)]
*  than he was when it came to creating a fair economy. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=401.44s)]
*  And I think anybody would have predicted. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=403.24s)]
*  We had Lena Kahn on the show very recently. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=404.6s)]
*  The problem is, of course, that Kamala Harris didn't run [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=406.28s)]
*  with a Lena Kahn agenda. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=408.98s)]
*  She ran with Mark Cuban and Liz Cheney rather than... [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=410.14s)]
*  We didn't see much of Lena Kahn on the campaign trail. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=412.64s)]
*  Do you think Democrats made a mistake not to break up Big Tech, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=416.52s)]
*  as Senator Elizabeth Warren was suggesting [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=419.12s)]
*  back when she ran for president in 2020 [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=421.02s)]
*  in the Democratic nominations? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=423.52s)]
*  Not only do we not break up Big Tech, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=425.26s)]
*  you had the Biden-Pentagon giving must contracts. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=427.26s)]
*  We had Chuck Schumer, your leader in the Senate, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=429.82s)]
*  hosting Musk for an AI summit less than 18 months ago. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=431.74s)]
*  Was that all a mistake in hindsight? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=434.98s)]
*  Well, again, we moved through the Senate [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=436.82s)]
*  under Chuck Schumer's leadership in the last Congress, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=438.86s)]
*  a piece of legislation that would have finally given kids [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=443.02s)]
*  some protection online, a piece of legislation [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  that the online social media companies didn't like. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=447.7s)]
*  But yes, years ago, we should have had the foresight [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=451.09999999999997s)]
*  to understand how poisonous this technology is to society. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=454.3s)]
*  It should be brought broadly to our children [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=459.36s)]
*  and either place regulations on it [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=461.92s)]
*  like we traditionally do with every new technology [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=464.52000000000004s)]
*  that comes along that is a breakthrough economic, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  social or cultural technology. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=469.66s)]
*  And we should have had the foresight to understand [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=471.8s)]
*  that these companies, when they get too big, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=473.64s)]
*  ultimately have the power to become immune [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=475.7s)]
*  from market forces. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=479.5s)]
*  So yes, our mission now needs to be to regulate [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=480.74s)]
*  these tech companies that are literally stealing from us [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=483.98s)]
*  and corrupting our lives and also to try to shrink [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=486.38s)]
*  the market place. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=488.56s)]
*  Shrinking power is very important. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=489.6s)]
*  But it's not just the tech billionaires, obviously. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  It's also the old-fashioned Wall Street billionaires [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  who are always there and are still around. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=494.5s)]
*  A lot of them are taking top-level cabinet positions [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=496.3s)]
*  under Donald Trump, including hedge fund manager Scott Besant, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=498.38s)]
*  who has been nominated by Trump for Treasury Secretary. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=501.14000000000004s)]
*  A man who went asked recently about whether he supported [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=503.82s)]
*  cutting Medicaid didn't seem to know what Medicaid was [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=506.22s)]
*  or covered. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=508.82s)]
*  When asked if he opposed raising the minimum wage, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=509.92s)]
*  he said, yes, he's not a fan of raising the minimum wage. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=511.42s)]
*  Is this what the much-fabled, working-class Americans [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=513.82s)]
*  voted for when they voted for Donald Trump? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=517.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what you're seeing being constructed [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=518.84s)]
*  is essentially a kleptocracy in which the billionaires [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=521.68s)]
*  of this country are going to steal from the poor [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=526.3199999999999s)]
*  and the middle class. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=528.52s)]
*  Four years ago, when they did that massive tax [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=530.26s)]
*  cut for the wealthy, eight years ago when they did [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=532.4s)]
*  the first Trump tax cut for the wealthy, it was all borrowed. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=534.4s)]
*  Now, that was miserable because we eventually [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=537.4s)]
*  have to pay that bill. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=539.66s)]
*  80% of that tax cut went to the richest 1%. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=540.86s)]
*  This time, they're not talking about borrowing it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=543.4s)]
*  This time, they're talking about cutting Medicare, Medicaid, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=545.12s)]
*  Obamacare subsidies, education, senior benefits. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=550.26s)]
*  So they literally are proposing to do a real-time transfer [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  of $2 to $4 trillion from poor people in the middle class [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=557.0999999999999s)]
*  and put it straight into the pockets [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=561.0s)]
*  of that billionaire cabinet. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=562.54s)]
*  And I don't think it's a secret that that's their agenda [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=564.38s)]
*  because they're advertising it in these hearings, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=568.04s)]
*  how out of touch they are and how entitled [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=570.3199999999999s)]
*  they feel to rip money out of the middle class [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  and poor people and put it in the pockets of the people [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=574.5799999999999s)]
*  who are already doing pretty freaking well. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=576.68s)]
*  And you've also got lobbyists in government, too, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=578.88s)]
*  not just billionaires. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=581.1199999999999s)]
*  Talk about draining the swamp. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=582.02s)]
*  Sean Duffy, who lobbied for transportation clients, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=583.38s)]
*  is going to be transportation secretary. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=585.9799999999999s)]
*  Susie Wiles, who ran a company that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=587.4599999999999s)]
*  lobbied for Chinese companies, is [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=589.3599999999999s)]
*  going to be chief of staff for this supposedly [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=591.3599999999999s)]
*  hawk on China president. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=593.16s)]
*  Do you think this administration is compromised financially, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=595.3599999999999s)]
*  ethically, even geopolitically? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=598.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but they're also not hiding that either. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=600.2399999999999s)]
*  So what happened during the campaign? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, Trump widely reported that the oil industry took a trip [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=604.36s)]
*  down to Mar-a-Lago and just did a deal with Trump, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  an old-fashioned deal. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=610.8399999999999s)]
*  We'll give you a billion dollars, a billion dollars, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=611.9s)]
*  in campaign contributions. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=614.3399999999999s)]
*  Like, that's hard to imagine. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  And Trump said, I'll give you whatever you want. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=616.78s)]
*  So guess what? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=618.74s)]
*  On day one, as part of that suite of executive orders, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=619.8199999999999s)]
*  there's a whole bunch of just sweetheart gifts [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=622.18s)]
*  for the oil and gas industry that's [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=624.38s)]
*  going to make those CEOs even richer, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=625.78s)]
*  those companies even richer. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=628.12s)]
*  It's all out there in the open. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=630.12s)]
*  The story is that by not raising objections [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=632.38s)]
*  to the blatant, transparent corruption that is happening, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=635.4599999999999s)]
*  we normalize it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=638.92s)]
*  Like, this is Corruption 101 staring you in the face. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=640.2199999999999s)]
*  What Zuckerberg did the other day, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=644.66s)]
*  where he went down there and got his instructions [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=646.4s)]
*  to stop fact-checking in exchange for a little lighter [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=648.4s)]
*  treatment from the government, what the oil industry did. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=650.9599999999999s)]
*  And it's all in the open. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=653.3399999999999s)]
*  It's all in the open. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  And so we don't talk about it, in part, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  because he's so brazen that he does it all out in the open. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=657.64s)]
*  And Americans are used to conspiracies [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=660.38s)]
*  being behind the scenes. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=661.78s)]
*  You voted for Marco Rubio to be Secretary of State. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=663.08s)]
*  1999 to 0 was the vote in his favor. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=665.5600000000001s)]
*  Is this the much-heralded bipartisanship [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=668.4s)]
*  that Chuck Schumer keeps going on about? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=670.76s)]
*  Or are Senate Democrats such as yourself, I don't know, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=672.4s)]
*  trying to pick your battles and only go after the really, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=675.2s)]
*  really, really bad nominees like Hegseth or RFK Junior, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=677.74s)]
*  not the just bad nominees like Rubio? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=682.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, most of them, I mean, 80%, 90% of them [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=684.0s)]
*  are in the really, really bad category. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=687.92s)]
*  But yes, listen, absolutely. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=690.7s)]
*  Should we swear off bipartisanship? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=692.84s)]
*  No. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=695.84s)]
*  The American people have no problem [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=697.04s)]
*  with us finding lanes of cooperation [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=698.88s)]
*  where it's going to help them. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=702.14s)]
*  So Chuck Schumer's not wrong to say [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=703.38s)]
*  that we should try to find bipartisanship where it exists. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=705.08s)]
*  It's just not going to exist in any real way, shape, or form, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=708.08s)]
*  because they have made it clear that they are going to ram [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=711.32s)]
*  through most of their agenda through this process called [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=714.02s)]
*  reconciliation, which they don't need a single bit of time. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=716.12s)]
*  But in nomination terms, in the vote side. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=718.36s)]
*  In nomination terms. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=719.9s)]
*  Like Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Junior, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=720.9s)]
*  those people who are just never non-negotiable for you? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=724.34s)]
*  Well, for me, certainly. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=727.28s)]
*  I can't speak for all 46 of my colleagues. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=728.84s)]
*  But yes, I think you will see every Democrat [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=731.84s)]
*  or close to every Democrat opposing those nominees. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=734.88s)]
*  There's always John Federman to do the MAGA bidding. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=737.82s)]
*  Trump has nominated longtime loyalist [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=741.02s)]
*  Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to run the Justice [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=743.16s)]
*  Department and the FBI. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=744.86s)]
*  They want to go after his enemies. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=746.16s)]
*  Kash Patel certainly has said so publicly. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=747.46s)]
*  Biden's preemptively pardoned some of those targets, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=749.76s)]
*  the Fauci's, the Cheney's. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=752.2s)]
*  How do you actually stop a state-sponsored vengeance [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  campaign by Trump, Bondi, Patel, and the rest? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=758.3000000000001s)]
*  They control the White House, the DOJ, the FBI, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=762.38s)]
*  both houses of Congress. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=765.08s)]
*  And they have a majority on the Supreme Court that says, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=766.2800000000001s)]
*  immunity. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=768.12s)]
*  How do Democrats push back against that? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=769.12s)]
*  Is there a way to push back against that? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=770.6600000000001s)]
*  Of course there is. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=772.98s)]
*  I'm not saying it isn't a narrow path. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=774.76s)]
*  But the American public is frustrated with democracy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=778.24s)]
*  They think that the rule of law mostly [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=782.3s)]
*  accrues to the benefit of the wealthy. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=784.64s)]
*  But they haven't given up on it. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=786.3399999999999s)]
*  And right now, they aren't convinced [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=788.8399999999999s)]
*  that Trump really is going to deliver us a slide from [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=790.78s)]
*  democracy to autocracy. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=795.54s)]
*  They'll only believe it if Democrats talk about it [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  on a regular basis, if Democrats connect [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=800.18s)]
*  the dots between what's happening to capture [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=803.02s)]
*  the media companies, the threats of violence that [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=805.9399999999999s)]
*  will now be regular against political opponents, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=809.2199999999999s)]
*  the possible legal actions that will be taken by [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=811.86s)]
*  Casper Tell's FBI. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=815.4599999999999s)]
*  If we lay out for the American people how dangerous [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=817.3199999999999s)]
*  this moment is for democracy, then yes, I think Republicans [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=820.26s)]
*  could pay a price for it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=822.9599999999999s)]
*  And ultimately, it only takes a handful of them, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=824.36s)]
*  in the Senate, for instance, to stand up [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=826.8s)]
*  to a couple of these nominees to get a different outcome. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=828.54s)]
*  So I just don't think we should give up [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=831.4s)]
*  on telling this story. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=833.38s)]
*  A lot of people don't have faith in your party right now, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=835.2399999999999s)]
*  including in your base. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=837.18s)]
*  A lot of Democratic voters are like, my party is just not [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=838.4s)]
*  strong enough. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=840.54s)]
*  They don't have a fight in them. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=841.38s)]
*  I mentioned the poll at the start, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=842.54s)]
*  which shows record low favorable ratings [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=843.78s)]
*  for the Democrats. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=845.68s)]
*  There seems to be a lot of examples [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=846.88s)]
*  of political malpractice. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=848.18s)]
*  On Sunday morning, when TikTok was still briefly banned, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=849.42s)]
*  you criticized the app for, quote, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=852.42s)]
*  tucking itself in with Trump after they displayed [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=853.92s)]
*  a message saying, Trump's going to work on a solution. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=856.5s)]
*  Then they put out a second message saying, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=858.66s)]
*  thank you, President Trump, for saving us the next day. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=860.0s)]
*  And look, I don't disagree with you. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=862.8399999999999s)]
*  TikTok's being cynical, self-serving, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=864.0999999999999s)]
*  sucking up to Trump. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=865.5999999999999s)]
*  But it was Democrats that essentially handed Trump [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=866.9599999999999s)]
*  that political victory. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=869.3399999999999s)]
*  It was you guys who voted to ban TikTok last year. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=870.54s)]
*  It was Joe Biden, through his inaction, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=872.9399999999999s)]
*  that allowed Trump to come in on day one [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=875.5s)]
*  and get this huge victory with young people. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=877.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, come on, Manny. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=879.98s)]
*  I mean, let's go back and actually remember [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=881.24s)]
*  how this thing played out, right? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=883.3199999999999s)]
*  So we were passing a national security supplemental bill [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  that was necessary in order to save millions of lives [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=888.36s)]
*  around the globe, $10 billion of humanitarian relief [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=891.92s)]
*  was necessary to save Ukraine from Russia. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=894.62s)]
*  And yes, Republicans put on the table [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=897.02s)]
*  as their price for that piece of legislation [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=899.36s)]
*  the legislation to ban TikTok. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=902.42s)]
*  It was Republicans who insisted that the only way [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=903.92s)]
*  that they would vote for that piece of legislation [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=906.4s)]
*  was if we added the ban on TikTok. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=908.86s)]
*  So you are right that as part of a compromise, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  Biden could have used a 90-day poll. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=914.4s)]
*  Democrats voted for it. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=915.98s)]
*  There was a 90-day poll built into it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=917.38s)]
*  But let's accurately assess blame [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=918.84s)]
*  where blame exists. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=920.8s)]
*  Republicans put that on the table. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=921.9599999999999s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, all the polls [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=924.6999999999999s)]
*  show the American public, including independents, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=926.0s)]
*  a poll out today saying they get the polls that show [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=927.5799999999999s)]
*  that they give credit to Trump. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=930.38s)]
*  I mean, it's logical. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=931.48s)]
*  Oh, no, no, I don't. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=932.28s)]
*  You gave him a victory. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=932.88s)]
*  I don't disagree with that. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=933.78s)]
*  But that is also due to a broader information [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=934.92s)]
*  infrastructure deficit that Democrats have right now. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=938.52s)]
*  It's not just the information deficit. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=941.4599999999999s)]
*  Biden could have stopped it on the weekend. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=942.86s)]
*  He could have done a 90-day pause and taken credit for it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=944.1s)]
*  And listen, let's also be clear. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=946.3199999999999s)]
*  I've been more critical than probably anybody else [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=948.44s)]
*  about the state of the Democratic Party. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=950.78s)]
*  But that poll you keep on citing that says 33% of Americans [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=952.1800000000001s)]
*  like Democrats says that 36% of Americans like Republicans. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=955.26s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=959.0600000000001s)]
*  So they're not popular either. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=959.86s)]
*  The story really is a broader indictment of political parties. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=961.0600000000001s)]
*  Yes, but you're less popular than Donald Trump's Republicans. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=963.9s)]

*  by concerns over China, but over Israel too? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=969.3000000000001s)]
*  Mitt Romney said to Antony Blinken on stage in Arizona [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=972.1s)]

*  to shut down TikTok because of, quote, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=977.1999999999999s)]

*  is designed to divide Americans from each other. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=994.3199999999999s)]

*  You're going after TikTok because of its content, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1004.16s)]

*  Gaza being one of many, is to try to divide Americans [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1014.96s)]
*  from each other. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1019.5600000000001s)]

*  owning the most, perhaps the most important social media [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1038.94s)]

*  What happened to Americans on TikTok in the Gaza debate [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1046.1200000000001s)]
*  is just an example of what TikTok is doing to us [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1049.8600000000001s)]
*  on a host of issues. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  What about people who say it's TikTok that allowed us [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1054.52s)]
*  to see what was happening in Gaza [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1056.3600000000001s)]
*  when the mainstream media weren't showing us images [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1057.7s)]
*  from that conflict? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1059.16s)]
*  Well, there's plenty of places where people can find [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1060.3600000000001s)]
*  those images of TikTok. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1062.44s)]
*  Only on social media? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1063.44s)]
*  But TikTok, if a Chinese-owned social media platform [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  disappears, there will be other places [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1067.2199999999998s)]
*  in which the truth will be told online. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1068.78s)]
*  TikTok isn't the only win Democrats handed to Trump. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1071.02s)]
*  Last week, we saw Biden announce a ceasefire deal [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1073.36s)]
*  had finally been reached in Gaza. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1075.86s)]
*  On the eve of Donald Trump taking power, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1077.4199999999998s)]
*  with Trump's envoy going to see Netanyahu, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1079.36s)]
*  apparently pressuring him into signing it, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1081.4599999999998s)]
*  Biden spent almost a year failing to pressure [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1083.4599999999998s)]
*  Netanyahu to sign that same deal. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1085.9399999999998s)]
*  It's pretty much the same deal that was on the table [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1087.4399999999998s)]
*  in May last year. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1089.1399999999999s)]
*  It gets signed on the eve of Trump coming to office. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1090.52s)]
*  A recent poll showed that among the millions of people [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1094.16s)]
*  who voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1097.56s)]
*  but did not vote for Harris in 2024, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1099.5s)]
*  the top reason they cited for voting [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1102.04s)]
*  for a non-democratic candidate or staying at home [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1103.94s)]
*  above the economy and immigration was Gaza, right? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1106.3s)]
*  So your party and its blind support for Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1109.64s)]
*  a man wanted for war crimes, many would argue [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1115.02s)]
*  helped cost you the election with swing voters [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1117.52s)]
*  and young voters, and it also gave Donald Trump [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1119.84s)]
*  the ability to claim credit for a ceasefire [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1122.3799999999999s)]
*  that was negotiated by Joe Biden. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1124.98s)]
*  Well, I'm not here as a representative [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1127.08s)]
*  of the Democratic Party. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1129.28s)]
*  You're a Democratic Senator. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1130.3799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1131.48s)]
*  I'm a Democratic Senator who has my own views, right? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1132.48s)]
*  And so I was very vocal in my support of a ceasefire. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1134.06s)]
*  I have been very vocal of my belief [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1137.7s)]
*  that Joe Biden should have used much more leverage. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1140.1s)]
*  I'm not sure it ever would have worked. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1143.2s)]
*  I think Benjamin Netanyahu made a decision early on [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1144.6s)]
*  that he was going to only deliver a ceasefire deal [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1146.82s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1150.56s)]
*  You think they did that deal? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1152.06s)]
*  To do that to Donald Trump. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1153.16s)]
*  I think Benjamin Netanyahu made a decision [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1154.46s)]
*  that he was not going to deliver a political benefit [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1157.36s)]
*  to Joe Biden, that his interest was [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1161.2s)]
*  in getting Donald Trump elected. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1163.58s)]
*  And so he was never going to do that deal [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1165.54s)]
*  until at the very least on the dawn of the inauguration. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1167.84s)]
*  But I can only speak for myself and my views on Gaza [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1172.48s)]
*  and my belief in a ceasefire and my vote [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1175.72s)]
*  to temporarily suspend certain weapons shipments to Israel [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1177.26s)]
*  because of the danger of terrorists growing in strength [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1181.7s)]
*  based upon the humanitarian conditions in Gaza [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1185.9s)]
*  have been well-known. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1188.2s)]
*  I'll speak for myself. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1189.0s)]
*  You did vote towards the end of last year [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1190.24s)]
*  against certain weapons, offensive weapons going to Israel. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1191.5s)]
*  I did. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1193.5s)]
*  But earlier in the year, you also [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1194.5s)]
*  voted for a lot of packages that did send weapons to Israel. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1195.74s)]
*  A new study in the Lancet Medical Journal [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1197.74s)]
*  suggests the death toll last summer was already above 60,000. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1199.48s)]
*  And I think that's a good example of what we're seeing [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1203.48s)]
*  in the world. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1205.58s)]
*  We've seen over 100,000 Gazans injured, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1206.48s)]
*  kids killed in Gaza at a higher rate [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1208.42s)]
*  than any other conflict in the world. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1209.96s)]
*  Northern Gaza, we now see the images wiped off the map. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1212.02s)]
*  Do you regret your party in Congress, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1215.22s)]
*  forget the Biden White House, giving essentially a blank check [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1217.7s)]
*  to a far-right Israeli government that's engaged [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1221.64s)]
*  in what Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1223.56s)]
*  multiple UN experts have called a genocide. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1225.9s)]
*  And you don't want to call it a genocide, that's fine. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1227.5s)]
*  But engage in what they've engaged in. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1229.38s)]
*  I think that's a good example of what we're seeing in the world. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1231.1s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of people supporting Israel [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1234.0s)]
*  in its defense of its people. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1236.34s)]
*  What happened on October 7th was an abomination. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1238.54s)]
*  And if we had turned our back on Israel [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1241.54s)]
*  and its need to make sure that Hamas pays a price, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1243.9199999999998s)]
*  that would have accrued to the detriment [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1246.9399999999998s)]
*  of US national security. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1248.82s)]
*  Were many of us almost immediately [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1250.8799999999999s)]
*  critical of the way in which those weapons were being used? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1253.58s)]
*  Did Joe Biden apply conditions to make sure [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1256.12s)]
*  that we could no longer support those weapons sales? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1258.92s)]
*  Did we not see the US eventually come to the decision [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1261.4s)]
*  that we could no longer support those weapons sales? [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1263.8000000000002s)]
*  Of course. But no, I don't regret the fact [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1266.2s)]
*  that the United States stood behind Israel. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1268.4s)]
*  Even with that death toll. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1270.2s)]
*  And I also think that we should be clear that, well, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1271.5s)]
*  as I have said repeatedly, Israel bears responsibility. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1275.74s)]
*  So does Hamas. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1280.02s)]
*  Hamas could have ended that war. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1281.48s)]
*  But we don't support Hamas. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1283.2800000000002s)]
*  You didn't vote for weapons to Hamas. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1284.48s)]
*  But Hamas could have decided to stand down [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1286.38s)]
*  and said, well, we're not responsible for that war. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1288.92s)]
*  You and I don't send our money to Hamas. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1291.02s)]
*  That war for months. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1292.52s)]
*  We're not responsible for anything Hamas does. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1293.5600000000002s)]
*  You and I are responsible for what Israel does. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1294.96s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1296.4s)]
*  But let's talk about accurately who [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1297.4s)]
*  is responsible for this carnage. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1299.3600000000001s)]
*  60,000 dead. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1301.0s)]
*  There's responsibility in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1302.0s)]
*  There's responsibility amongst Hamas leadership. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1305.0s)]
*  But we're responsible for only one part of that, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1307.1000000000001s)]
*  you would agree? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1308.74s)]
*  We fund one part of that. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1309.74s)]
*  We don't fund Hamas. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1310.8400000000001s)]
*  I would agree that we are allied with Israel [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1311.94s)]
*  to protect Israel's security. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1313.72s)]
*  So we're responsible for those deaths. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1314.8200000000002s)]
*  I know we're out of time, but I've [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  been saying just before we finish, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1317.34s)]
*  the Democrats have a 33% favorability rating. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1318.98s)]
*  I know you pointed out Republicans are at 36. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1321.3799999999999s)]
*  It's shockingly low. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1323.08s)]
*  And you said after the election, you said, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1324.32s)]
*  the party has never fully grappled [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1326.82s)]
*  with the wreckage of 50 years of neoliberalism, which [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1328.4199999999998s)]
*  has left legions of Americans adrift. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1331.06s)]
*  Real economic populism should be our temple. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1332.8s)]
*  A lot of people cheered to hear you say that. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1335.52s)]
*  People say it sounds a lot like Bernie Sanders back in 2016, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1337.76s)]
*  2020. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1340.24s)]
*  Based on what you're saying now with the benefit of hindsight, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1341.3s)]
*  do you think the Democrats made a mistake not [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1343.34s)]
*  going with Sanders in one of those two elections? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1345.1799999999998s)]
*  Oh, I have no idea. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1347.86s)]
*  I mean. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1348.86s)]
*  Or at least, OK, forget Sanders to person. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1349.76s)]
*  The vision. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1351.02s)]
*  The vision of Bernie Sanders? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1352.56s)]
*  I mean, listen, I obviously have a great deal of affection [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1355.06s)]
*  for Bernie as a person, but his message, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1357.8999999999999s)]
*  which is about taking on corporate power, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1362.1s)]
*  taking on elite power, and delivering power [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1365.04s)]
*  in real, tangible ways to regular people. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1368.1799999999998s)]
*  I love his discipline about an economic message that [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1370.78s)]
*  breaks through. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1373.9599999999998s)]
*  I love the fact that he is iconoclastic, right? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  That he sort of doesn't fit into boxes. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1377.4199999999998s)]
*  That he doesn't sound like everybody else. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1379.52s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of things [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1382.62s)]
*  that we can learn from a brand that is very focused [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1383.8799999999999s)]
*  on ordinary, regular people and very focused [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1387.76s)]
*  on the deconstruction of elite power. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1391.5s)]
*  What happened to this party is that we became [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1393.56s)]
*  the party of the status quo. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1395.6s)]
*  People decided that they wanted to blow the whole system up, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1397.54s)]
*  and they came to the conclusion that Donald Trump was more [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1401.24s)]
*  likely to blow it up. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1403.4199999999998s)]
*  And we got to look at ourselves in the mirror [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1405.82s)]
*  and ask ourselves, is it in part because we became a high income [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1407.9599999999998s)]
*  coalition that we all of a sudden [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1412.36s)]
*  started endorsing ideas that really weren't [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1414.36s)]
*  as revolutionary as people want ideas to be? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1417.8s)]
*  2028 candidate for president for the Democrats [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1422.1799999999998s)]
*  should be an economic populist? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1424.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, the Democratic Party will make that decision, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1426.1399999999999s)]
*  but I think if we want to win, you [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1428.34s)]
*  have got to make economic populism and economic fairness [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1430.1799999999998s)]
*  the tent pole of your party. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1432.82s)]
*  You've got to build a bigger tent in which you have [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1434.72s)]
*  the courage, maybe courage is the right word, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1437.52s)]
*  in which you are willing to bring in some people [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1440.22s)]
*  to that tent that might not line up with you on all the issues [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1443.8s)]
*  that I think are important, gay rights, guns, climate, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1447.26s)]
*  but are willing to be part of a coalition that says, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1451.8s)]
*  we're going to break up concentrated economic power. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1454.24s)]
*  We're going to raise your wages. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  We're going to make work pay again. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1457.6399999999999s)]
*  And with the candidate pushing that message in 2028, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1459.04s)]
*  will his name be Chris Murphy? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1461.34s)]
*  No, I do not think so. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1462.6399999999999s)]
*  So I think I've got a pretty good job [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1464.12s)]
*  in the United States Senate. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1466.28s)]
*  You know I have to ask the follow-up question. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1467.48s)]
*  You're not ruling it out. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1469.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm staying in the United States Senate. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1470.62s)]
*  I just got re-elected. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1472.56s)]
*  All right. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1473.66s)]
*  Well, congratulations for getting re-elected. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19qwRYDmW-U&t=1474.66s)]
