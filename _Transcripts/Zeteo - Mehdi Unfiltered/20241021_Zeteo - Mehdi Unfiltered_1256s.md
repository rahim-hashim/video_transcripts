# Ilhan Omar on Kamala Harris’s Failing Outreach to Muslim Voters
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo)
*  Joining me now to talk more about Harris and Gaza and Trump is Minnesota representative and squad member [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=0.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar welcome back to the show. Thank you for being in the studio for May the unfiltered [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=6.04s)]
*  Last time we spoke at the DNC and I want to come to that but before we get to that this is breaking news out [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=11.24s)]
*  Today Israel has confirmed the assassination of the Hamas leader in Gaza. Yeah, yes in war [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=16.44s)]
*  They call him the mastermind of October the 7th in the wake of his killing a Republican congressman Mike Turner [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=21.38s)]
*  On the House Intelligence Committee said that he hopes quote sin was elimination will result in further progress [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=27.16s)]
*  Towards the release of hostages as well as a ceasefire [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=33.28s)]
*  Senator Van Hollen and others on the Democratic side have said there could be some silver lining to this could this end the war [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=35.8s)]
*  Do you believe this is gonna lead to an end to the conflict or is Netanyahu gonna carry on regardless of who he kills? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=41.0s)]
*  Or catch well, I mean it always seems like you know, we have this sort of hopeful [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=45.84s)]
*  vision of what is possible without [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=51.16s)]
*  Creating the the conditions to make [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=55.32s)]
*  That possible and we hear Netanyahu say [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=58.16s)]
*  That you know, this is this is not the end [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  And he is not going to stop [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=65.2s)]
*  And and we really do not know what his end goal is outside of the initial [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=68.24s)]
*  You know press conferences that he had where he was clearly intent on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Ethnically cleansing the Palestinians out of Gaza [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=81.92s)]
*  So the ethnic cleansing is ongoing. We're seeing horrific scenes out of northern Gaza this week [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=86.0s)]
*  It's been about two months since you and I spoke at the DNC time flies at the time [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=91.28s)]
*  You were hoping to see some policy changes on Gaza from Vice President Harris [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  There haven't been any in the past two months the war meanwhile has escalated from Gaza to Lebanon [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  Maybe now in the coming days Iran [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=105.44s)]
*  Is this where you thought we'd be two months on from the DNC and is it making your job harder? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=107.8s)]
*  To try and get people maybe in your district to vote for Kamala Harris [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=112.64s)]
*  This is not where I thought we would be two months ago, and I certainly did not think we would be here a year later [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=116.64s)]
*  The the fact that there it seems to be an escalation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  Really? I think it's a testament to the fact that we seem to think Israel is an ally [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  But they seem to not treat us with the respect and the dignity [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=132.66000000000003s)]
*  That that we deserve and I think you know, not in Yahoo clearly does not want a Democrat back in in the White House [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=137.06s)]
*  He wants to make sure Trump is successful in his campaign [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  That is mostly who he would like to work with and we've seen that rhetoric from Trump and fans [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=148.5s)]
*  And and the Republican side on what they would like to see happen to the people of Gaza [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  And I think we have to be clear-eyed about what that possibility could mean for the people of Gaza [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=160.66s)]
*  But it's interesting you mentioned Netanyahu wants Trump which is obvious, but it's not just you saying that there's reporting that Joe Biden in private [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=166.18s)]
*  Has said that Netanyahu is trying to get Trump elected which really really really confuses me because if he knows [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=171.82s)]
*  That Netanyahu is doing all this to get Trump elected. Why is he going along with it? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=177.42s)]
*  Why is he undermining Democratic Party's chances in November? Yeah [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=180.38s)]
*  I mean that seems to be the biggest question that all of us have. Do you know why? I would love an answer [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=183.46s)]
*  I think it is quite heartbreaking [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=189.62s)]
*  To to watch us be humiliated, you know, I talk a lot about [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=193.34s)]
*  Secretary Blinken [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=199.42s)]
*  Constantly being humiliated as he goes over to to Israel and makes these lavish speeches about you know [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=201.14s)]
*  The progress that's being made just to have [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=208.38s)]
*  Netanyahu follow and and say no there is no such thing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=211.9s)]
*  We're not listening to these people and we don't know what they're talking about that level of humiliation on a [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=215.5s)]
*  International stage I think undermines [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  our credibility and our strength as as a nation and to actually have a client state right this is [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=225.01999999999998s)]
*  Israel is a [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  recipient of the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=235.33999999999997s)]
*  of the generosity of the people of America and [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=237.73999999999998s)]
*  The fact that they do not respect the people of America and and are unwilling to at least [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=241.58s)]
*  Utilize the weapons that we are giving them to not cause civilian harm [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=248.02s)]
*  violates [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  Human rights it violates our laws and violates international law and just recently Blinken [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=255.78s)]
*  and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=262.42s)]
*  Secretary Austin seemed to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=263.5s)]
*  Right take a step but I don't think I don't think that there will be a response that's that's favorable [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=265.54s)]
*  And that's a shame. It is a shame and it's not just geopolitically bad. It's domestically electorally bad [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=273.38s)]
*  Vice President Harris is clearly doing better than Joe Biden was against Donald Trump still in the polls [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=279.34s)]
*  But the enthusiasm we saw for her in August at the DNC just before the DNC clearly that is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=283.7s)]
*  Not where it was a couple of months ago a new ABC News Ipsos poll showed that she went from a five-point lead [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  Over Trump back in September to now only a two-point lead an NBC News poll showed her going from a five-point lead to neck-and-neck [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=296.38s)]
*  With Trump so whatever leads she had seemed to be being eroded [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=302.74s)]
*  Why do you think that is a lot of people say it's because she's not taking on the mantle of a change candidate when she's asked [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=306.02s)]
*  On the view will you be different from Biden? She says I would have done nothing differently [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=311.14s)]
*  She's campaigning not with progressives or [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=314.46s)]
*  Arab-americans in Michigan, which she needs to win. She's campaigning with Liz Cheney and Biden's praising dick Cheney [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=318.18s)]
*  You know have they kind of undermined even squashed some of that progressive energy and excitement that we saw in August and September [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=323.02s)]
*  Well, you know polls obviously are a snapshot of a moment and there is a you know, clearly [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=330.9s)]
*  Shift in in polling depending on what what is happening that week [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=339.06s)]
*  Or or that month I will say, you know on the ground in in Minnesota [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=344.18s)]
*  We saw a groundswell of enthusiasm and I have not seen that way to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=348.46s)]
*  And and disappear that enthusiasm is still there [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=353.9s)]
*  I do think that people forget that she is a sitting vice president to the president [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=357.65999999999997s)]
*  Criticizing or undermining any progress the president has made or has not made [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=364.97999999999996s)]
*  Is it's not something that has been asked of any vice president [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=370.26s)]
*  Humphrey when he did distance himself from LBJ on Vietnam and did much better as a result [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=375.58s)]
*  But she she interestingly does take some rhetorical stances that sometimes feel different [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=379.62s)]
*  She tweeted this week about the situation in northern Gaza [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=384.46s)]
*  The UN reports that no food has entered northern Gaza in nearly two weeks Israel must urgently do more [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=386.94s)]
*  International humanitarian law must be respected which is something Joe Biden hasn't said certainly something Donald Trump will never say [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=392.18s)]
*  But again, it's this role of bystander as if she has no power or influence or leverage. She keeps saying I'm a prosecutor [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=397.98s)]
*  She could say as a prosecutor I will enforce the law. I will enforce international humanitarian law [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=404.78000000000003s)]
*  I will enforce the Leahy law she could do that, but I do think just because she spoke up [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=409.22s)]
*  I think that is what prompted the the letter that secretary Blinken and secretary Austin did sent [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=413.82s)]
*  I do believe that we could possibly [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=420.26s)]
*  see changes [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=425.22s)]
*  She does seem to constantly say she wants to follow the law and it is my expectation [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=427.18s)]
*  That that she will so that's your expectation [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=434.9s)]
*  But a lot of voters as you know better than me are saying no, we're not seeing any evidence of any change [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=437.53999999999996s)]
*  Rhetoric isn't enough a tweet isn't enough [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=441.9s)]
*  We need actual policy change people are literally being [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=443.74s)]
*  Genocided in northern Gaza as we speak this week and a lot of people especially on the left a lot of Arab Americans Muslim Americans [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=446.41999999999996s)]
*  You know this I'm sure Somali Americans tell you this in your district [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=452.58s)]
*  In Michigan a lot of Arab Americans are speaking very loudly. I've spoken to them. They say we're voting Jill Stein [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=455.88s)]
*  We're voting green because she's the only candidate who stops the genocide. What do you say to them? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=461.0s)]
*  Well, I've always said that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=466.2s)]
*  as as the candidate running for for president it is [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=468.88s)]
*  Vice President Harris's job to convince and win over these voters [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=474.72s)]
*  and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=480.96s)]
*  The efforts that are currently being made are not enough you cannot do outreach [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=482.36s)]
*  To a community when you cannot deliver the thing that they are asking for [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=488.12s)]
*  And so unless and when that that happens [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=493.92s)]
*  I am afraid that these voters are not going to come over and vote for her [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  Just on the Green Party though. What is your argument when people say they're voting Greek? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=504.48s)]
*  A lot of people are criticizing Muslims who support Harris the Green Party now has a vice presidential candidate who is Muslim [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=508.32s)]
*  Butchware he was on this show recently on Instagram. He called you quote beyond reprehensible [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  He said about you after you praised a group of Somali community leaders for endorsing Harris [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=519.88s)]
*  He has also suggested that Muslims who vote for Harris or endorse Harris are not proper Muslims [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=523.56s)]
*  They're hypocrites that they have betrayed the people of Gaza. What's your response? I don't know who this person is, but clearly [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=527.88s)]
*  It is always wrong [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=534.92s)]
*  for a candidate to [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=538.08s)]
*  Characterize the people who are opposed to them or supporting their their opponents in the ways in which [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=541.84s)]
*  He has done and you know, I was born Muslim [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=548.12s)]
*  I will die Muslim and I do not have a qualifier to my Muslimness that I worry about [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=551.66s)]
*  And I do believe certainly, you know Jill Stein herself talks about the fact that [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=558.32s)]
*  The chances of her winning are nonexistent [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=564.62s)]
*  And so in places where the margins are small [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=567.9s)]
*  you have to worry about what that means in regards to a second Trump presidency and [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=571.66s)]
*  Speaking for myself that is not something I'm willing to risk or willing to entertain [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=580.1s)]
*  So I will do everything in my power [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=585.26s)]
*  To make sure that that man does not become our president again [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=587.9399999999999s)]
*  I will come back to Donald Trump in a moment [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=591.74s)]
*  But just sticking with Gaza and US policy back in April after Israel's deadly strike on the world's central kitchen staff [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=593.98s)]
*  You and I think 55 other House Democrats including Nancy Pelosi signed a letter to Biden and blinking urging them to withhold weapons to Israel [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=600.82s)]
*  Now on the one hand, I never imagined Nancy Pelosi would sign a letter like that [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=608.46s)]
*  Tells you how much the kind of spectrum is shifting on Israel, but that's still a tiny minority of Democrats in Congress [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=611.86s)]
*  And let's not even get started on Republicans none of whom have any qualms about arming Israel [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=618.42s)]
*  Why do you think Congress an institution you've been part of now for several years has been so blind to the genocide so unwilling? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=622.9s)]
*  To even put some conditions on some aid. Why? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=628.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think you know many of them [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=633.78s)]
*  Are on this, you know, we [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=637.3s)]
*  Wholeheartedly support Israel and I think you know friends do not allow [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=642.14s)]
*  Their friends to commit [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=648.22s)]
*  crimes [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=649.98s)]
*  and the fact that we have colleagues who are unable and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=651.34s)]
*  unwilling to enforce the laws of this land on the behest of [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=658.06s)]
*  Israel that would not do that that would not reciprocate that [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=664.3s)]
*  Is I think something that they should be ashamed of not just on the basics of morality [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=668.86s)]
*  But they should be ashamed of the fact that they are unwilling to uphold our laws [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=675.46s)]
*  Two of your close colleagues in the squad [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=681.1s)]
*  Congressman Jamal Bowman congressman Cory Bush [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=684.0600000000001s)]
*  Both of whom like yourself have been outspoken on Gaza actually lost their primaries the Democratic Party primaries in their seats that congressional careers are now over [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=686.62s)]
*  After a pack spent millions over 20 million dollars to defeat them both [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=694.58s)]
*  What was your reaction to their defeats at the hands of a pack? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=698.74s)]
*  And why do you think a pack chose to stay out of your primary this year? Yeah [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=702.62s)]
*  Well, you know, I I love [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=706.14s)]
*  Congresswoman Cory Bush and congressman Jamal Bowman [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=708.7800000000001s)]
*  They are not just close allies but two of my favorite human beings to to serve with [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=712.3000000000001s)]
*  I know their spouses their families and they've become really really close to to mine and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=719.62s)]
*  And it is unfortunate that they have [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=726.5400000000001s)]
*  Lost their their seat. I think the reason a pack stayed out of [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=729.54s)]
*  My race is they think they did see the the strength that that we had [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=736.22s)]
*  to win re-election [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=742.78s)]
*  And they did try [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=745.1s)]
*  In other ways without being vocal to help my my opponent [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=747.74s)]
*  It is also true that they are retroactive in my district [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=753.3s)]
*  You know back in 2020 when they dumped in millions of dollars [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=758.1s)]
*  We won by 60 percent of the votes. And so I think they've learned [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=763.26s)]
*  Their their lesson. I represent a very progressive [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=768.02s)]
*  human rights [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=772.46s)]
*  focused district I represent great human beings and [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=774.1800000000001s)]
*  And I am confident that the the votes I take the decisions I make is [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=777.98s)]
*  They know that it's with them in mind [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=784.38s)]
*  And that was the primary you're currently up for reelection in the general next month in Minnesota's 5th district running against Republican Dahlia [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=787.5s)]
*  Al-Aqidi last week she actually had to ask her campaign manager Matthew Brodsky [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=793.7s)]
*  To resign after he said on Twitter that Israel should carpet bomb the Irish peacekeepers in southern Lebanon [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=797.9s)]
*  Adding that he hopes each of them are quote blasted to bits [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=803.5400000000001s)]
*  What does that say about her? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=807.5400000000001s)]
*  What does that say about the modern Republican Party that someone so hateful so incendiary so supportive of violence? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=809.34s)]
*  Abroad was just until a few days ago running a congressional campaign. Yeah, I mean it says all of that that these are [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=815.42s)]
*  deranged [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=822.9799999999999s)]
*  People these are people who are so filled with hate [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=824.62s)]
*  their [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=829.7399999999999s)]
*  ability to dehumanize [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=831.14s)]
*  And and want to cause catastrophe is is beyond measure [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=834.26s)]
*  and I think I take you know great offense to him wanting to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=839.38s)]
*  The [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=843.98s)]
*  Carpet bomb the the Irish as someone who's married to a man of Irish heritage [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=845.38s)]
*  I think it is it is not just offensive but disgusting [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=850.0999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about Donald Trump because this is his party and I feel like there's been a bit of a rehabilitation of Trump [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=856.0999999999999s)]
*  Weirdly not just in the media [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=861.5s)]
*  But some Americans seem to have amnesia and forget what he did you even in some Muslim American Arab Americans [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=862.6999999999999s)]
*  You have a Muslim mayor in Michigan who's endorsed him bizarrely you were on the receiving end of a lot of his hate and [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=869.62s)]
*  bile and [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=875.34s)]
*  incitement to violence [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=876.26s)]
*  He famously led a crowd chanting send her back in relation to you. He said a lot of racist misogynist things things about yourself [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=877.74s)]
*  I'm curious to know what is your reaction to the Arab American and Muslim American [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=883.74s)]
*  Voters who aren't that worried about Trump's Islamophobia who say we're gonna vote for him because at the end of the day Kamala Harris [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=888.0600000000001s)]
*  Did a genocide so we're gonna vote Trump to punish her [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=894.62s)]
*  I [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=897.1s)]
*  Mean I [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=899.34s)]
*  Cannot imagine [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=902.22s)]
*  The the idea of [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=905.42s)]
*  Someone just within a short period of time forgetting that this was a man who instituted a Muslim ban [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=909.3s)]
*  that threatened [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=917.26s)]
*  our lives and and our liberties [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=919.3s)]
*  Where we relied on so many allies showing up for us in order to feel protected [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=922.98s)]
*  This is a man who? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=929.6999999999999s)]
*  capped [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=932.42s)]
*  Refugee admissions this is was a man who? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=934.78s)]
*  Did not want to have family reunification which divided a lot of our families [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=938.98s)]
*  I remember I still remember the many phone calls that I would get of people who did not have the ability for the relatives to attend [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=944.14s)]
*  Weddings, I remember you know meeting this this young mom from Yemen [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=951.58s)]
*  whose child [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=956.58s)]
*  desperately needed [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=958.22s)]
*  Healthcare services and and she did not have the the ability to provide that to him because of the Muslim ban [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=960.98s)]
*  You know the response you've heard the response people say it doesn't matter Muslim man's not as bad as a genocide. Well, yes [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=969.4200000000001s)]
*  Nothing is compared to to they say well, you know what he's not that bad compared to the current [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=975.52s)]
*  Compare to genocide, but the genocide does not end with Trump election true the genocide will most likely be worse [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=981.16s)]
*  And our ability to advocate as he thinks anybody who is against him is an enemy within [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=989.84s)]
*  Diminishes and so I would like to still have a fighting chance [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=997.9599999999999s)]
*  In advocating for the end of this genocide without ending up behind bars [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1003.04s)]
*  And if you want of my constitutional rights and people hear that that's hyperbole, but Trump has said openly [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1009.84s)]
*  I think we have a clip that we can play of Trump talking about the enemy within and how we would use the National Guard [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1015.04s)]
*  Let's play that clip the bigger problem are the people from within we have some very bad people [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1020.64s)]
*  We have some sick people radical left lunatics [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1025.36s)]
*  And I think they're the bay and it should be very easily handled by if necessary by [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1028.76s)]
*  National Guard or if really necessary by the military. He also is threatening to use the alien act [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1034.12s)]
*  Right, which he already implemented within the Muslim ban, which he forgets [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1041.12s)]
*  You know, he's he's banned people from countries [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1047.08s)]
*  He supposedly at war with but he wants to use it against gangs who are not from countries where it was that none of it [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1050.0s)]
*  Makes sense and and and he wants mass deportations [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1054.1999999999998s)]
*  And so the the threat to our democracy in itself alone is a reason to fear him [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1057.76s)]
*  But everything else that he is promising to do to us [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1063.8s)]
*  And to everything we care about [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1069.12s)]
*  Really for me is enough. So [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1072.16s)]
*  Vice President Harris talks a lot about the threat from Donald Trump [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1076.68s)]
*  A lot of people say that's not enough [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1080.24s)]
*  We need something to vote for not just vote against [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  When we spoke at the DNC you said to our viewers then that if Harris loses in November [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1084.0s)]
*  Democrats will quote have no one to blame but ourselves. Do you still believe that to be true? Yes [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1088.0s)]
*  When you are a candidate running for office, it is your job to convince as many voters as possible [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1094.44s)]
*  On why they should vote for you. And so if we do not do everything that is within our power whether it is [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1101.7600000000002s)]
*  Policy change you saw black men [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1109.2800000000002s)]
*  Were upset and [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1111.94s)]
*  We saw a policy proposal for black men [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1115.82s)]
*  Muslims are upset. We see no policy proposal [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1121.42s)]
*  There are young progressives that are upset. There is no proposal. And so unless [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1125.94s)]
*  We contend with that [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1133.02s)]
*  if [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1135.86s)]
*  The election does not go our way [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1137.18s)]
*  We have to be reminded of these conversations and not point fingers at the people who have made a decision [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1139.42s)]
*  Because they did not see anything at the table for them [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1145.9s)]
*  Well put last question on an unrelated topic a few weeks ago you in Congresswoman [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1150.7800000000002s)]
*  I on a press he introduced a long kovat bill in Congress [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1155.3400000000001s)]
*  It would provide the National Institute of Health with extra 1 billion dollars in funding for studying this disease [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1158.7s)]
*  Which is believed to affect roughly 17 million people in this country 7% of all adults in America suffering from long cover [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1164.08s)]
*  And that's a conservative estimate because no one still quite knows how to define it [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1170.6s)]
*  Why has it taken so long to get attention to this quite crucial issue? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1174.36s)]
*  Because it's it's not as visible as [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1180.12s)]
*  Covid was when it was actually killing people [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1185.44s)]
*  There is not a national conversation. You don't see [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1188.84s)]
*  News coverage of it [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1192.5200000000002s)]
*  You know my advocacy Ayanna's advocacy senator Bernie Sanders who carries the Senate version [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1194.5600000000002s)]
*  Came out of our constituents and people that we know in our lives that are that are struggling with it [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1201.72s)]
*  And that prompted us to take action. I think that's the thing that people forget, you know, we don't just sit in a room and dream up [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1APOXIOL3yo&t=1208.24s)]
