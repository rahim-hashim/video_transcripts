# “I would EXPOSE Their War Crimes in Balochistan”: Mahrang Baloch Tells Mehdi Hasan
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs)
*  Imagine you're a young female human rights activist [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=0.0s)]
*  and Time magazine recognises you as one of today's most influential leaders. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=2.72s)]
*  But when you try to board a plane to attend the awards ceremony in New York, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=6.72s)]
*  you're told by immigration authorities in your country [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=10.56s)]
*  that you are not allowed to travel there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=13.24s)]
*  That's exactly what happened to Dr. Maharang Baloch, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=15.52s)]
*  who was included in the Time 100 Next List of 2024. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Maharang is a human rights activist [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=22.84s)]
*  advocating for the rights of the Baloch community in Pakistan, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=24.88s)]
*  which, last time I checked, is a close US ally. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=28.12s)]
*  Last December, she led a march to Islamabad [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=31.12s)]
*  to protest the killings of Pakistan's Baloch minority, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=33.32s)]
*  which included her father, also a prominent activist, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=36.24s)]
*  who was abducted in 2009 and sadly found dead two years later. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=39.2s)]
*  The march made waves in bringing attention to the Baloch struggle [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=43.72s)]
*  and surely caught the attention of the Pakistani government. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=47.0s)]
*  When Maharang arrived at the airport to fly to the United States [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=49.92s)]
*  to attend the Time magazine ceremony in New York, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=52.56s)]
*  she was prevented from travelling without any basis or explanation. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=55.56s)]
*  Because there was not a legitimate purpose to prevent my travel, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=59.720000000000006s)]
*  just to silence the Baloch vices internationally, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=64.16s)]
*  to conceal the two decades-long genocide [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=68.0s)]
*  and the human rights violation back in Balochistan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=70.72s)]
*  Advocacy group Frontline Defenders [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=73.56s)]
*  strongly condemned the move by Pakistani authorities, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  calling it part of a pattern of abuse against Maharang [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=77.68s)]
*  and Baloch human rights defenders in that country. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this is Dr. Maharang Baloch. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=84.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show today. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=87.32s)]
*  Can you tell us what exactly happened at the airport [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=90.28s)]
*  as you're trying to leave Pakistan to go to New York [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  to be recognised by Time magazine? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  On 7th of October, I had a flight to board for New York. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=102.16s)]
*  But when I arrived at immigration, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=110.91999999999999s)]
*  they took my passport without any explanation. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=114.96s)]
*  So I was there at the airport for more than five hours. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=119.52s)]
*  I was running behind the FIA officials [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  and asking them why I had been prevented to take my flight. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=128.12s)]
*  The thing is that they didn't even answer me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=132.88s)]
*  After two hours, they gave me a vague explanation [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=135.16s)]
*  that your visa is not valid. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=138.92s)]
*  Although I had a five-year visa. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=143.88s)]
*  For the US? Your visa for the US they were trying to enforce? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=147.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  Even though you were invited by Time magazine? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=153.76s)]
*  Yes. They even didn't show my documents. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=155.48s)]
*  I was searching for the in-charge, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=160.64s)]
*  but in-charge himself disappeared from the airport. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=162.67999999999998s)]
*  Marang, why do you believe they stopped you from travelling to the US? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=166.84s)]
*  Because I represent a cause, the Baloch national cause. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=173.36s)]
*  They prevented me to not reach New York. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=177.8s)]
*  And also, if I would reach New York, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=182.88000000000002s)]
*  I would expose their war crimes in Balochistan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=186.12s)]
*  What their army is doing every day in Balochistan. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=189.88000000000002s)]
*  They are abducting innocent people and not confined to Balochistan, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=193.88s)]
*  but also in the Punjab province. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=198.28s)]
*  Like yesterday night, three Baloch students are abducted [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=202.12s)]
*  from their hostel in Lahore. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=207.24s)]
*  It became a norm in Balochistan to get abducted, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=209.72s)]
*  even though to get mutilated and receive your beloved bodies [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  in return from the state forces. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=218.12s)]
*  Are you worried about your own safety now, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=222.36s)]
*  given you've got all this prominence now? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=224.04s)]
*  They know in Pakistan that people in America are inviting you to speak. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=226.48s)]
*  They blocked you from travelling. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=230.2s)]
*  Are you worried about your safety going forward in a place like Pakistan, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=231.56s)]
*  where unfortunately there has been a lot of political violence, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=234.28s)]
*  targeted killings? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=236.8s)]
*  Yes, Mehdi. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=240.48s)]
*  I am... [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=242.56s)]
*  That makes me very depressed when we, you know, when we leave our home [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=244.0s)]
*  and when we saw our mother, we say that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=249.12s)]
*  we don't know whether we will return or not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=252.2s)]
*  Like all of the human rights defenders, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=256.44s)]
*  those who dare to speak against the state atrocities, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=260.08s)]
*  their own lives and also their family lives are in danger. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=263.88s)]
*  So I know at a point in my life I get killed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=268.36s)]
*  And they don't fear anything. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=274.0s)]
*  For doing this, law itself is supporting them to do this. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  It is awful to hear what's happening there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=281.12s)]
*  Pakistan is a very close ally of the United States. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=283.44s)]
*  What is your message to President Biden, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=286.24s)]
*  the Biden administration, the US State Department? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  They must be aware of the fact that you were denied the right to travel [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=290.8s)]
*  to New York for this high-profile event. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=293.64000000000004s)]
*  What's your message to the American government? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=295.48s)]
*  My message is very clear. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=297.6s)]
*  Do not turn a blind eye to the sufferings and oppression in Balochistan. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=298.84000000000003s)]
*  For years, our people have suffered in forced disappearances, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=303.64000000000004s)]
*  extrajudicial killings, and unimaginable human rights violations. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=307.0s)]
*  And the US is a big ally. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  It is supporting Pakistan in many things, also in counterterrorism. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  But the aid they give in counterterrorism that is used to, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=318.4s)]
*  you know, suppress Baloch masses. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=324.56s)]
*  Our voices have been silenced by a powerful military state [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=327.52s)]
*  that controls the narrative, and we are not giving up. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=331.59999999999997s)]
*  We are fighting for justice. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=334.91999999999996s)]
*  And our issue of Balochistan is being concealed for decades [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=336.84s)]
*  because of what's happening in Afghanistan [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=343.71999999999997s)]
*  and what's happening, you know, in the borders of Balochistan. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=346.67999999999995s)]
*  And now the world is more focused on Gaza situation and Ukraine. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=350.35999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  But yes, you cannot stay blind-eyed on Balochistan [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=356.55999999999995s)]
*  because our situation is getting worse day by day, year by year. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=361.28s)]
*  One last question for you. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=366.76s)]
*  And not a single person that belongs to Baloch community is safe. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=371.96s)]
*  One last question for you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=372.96s)]
*  You were supposed to be travelling to New York [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=374.76s)]
*  to be on Times 100 Next List of 2024. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  What did it feel to you to get that recognition [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=379.24s)]
*  from a major Western media publication? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  What would your late father have made of your accomplishment [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=385.0s)]
*  on behalf of the Baloch cause? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=387.08s)]
*  That was the dream of my father. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=389.44s)]
*  He saw a dream, and he, you know... [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=392.12s)]
*  He has given me many teachings that you have to be a political activist. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=394.92s)]
*  You have to stand with your people. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=401.12s)]
*  So, getting this recognition is empowering and humbling. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=405.0s)]
*  Because it's not just from my personal mind-stone, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=412.8s)]
*  but it's, you know, a dedication and a victory [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=416.56s)]
*  for the struggle of Baloch women, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=421.68s)]
*  for our nation's collective fight against... [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=424.24s)]
*  for peace and... [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=428.84s)]
*  peace and justice in our land. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=432.36s)]
*  And I am very proud of our struggle. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=435.68s)]
*  We lack national recognition. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=440.08s)]
*  All of the media, all of the state institutions [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=442.08s)]
*  are supporting the state propaganda, you know? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  Flaming and... [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=448.84000000000003s)]
*  that we are traitors, we are anti-state. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=450.84000000000003s)]
*  But still, our people have lost the hope to struggle. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  So, the international recognition is the hope for us. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=458.8s)]
*  Because we are not being heard in our own land. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=464.44s)]
*  All of the people keep aside... [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=467.24s)]
*  those who try to speak get killed. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmCTsbER1qs&t=471.40000000000003s)]
