# Why the Tech Bros Allied with Trump
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k)
*  Has there ever been a president quite like Donald Trump? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=0.0s)]
*  Twice impeached, convicted on 34 felony counts, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=3.2s)]
*  an insider of insurrection, and yet back in the White House [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=6.2s)]
*  after a four-year absence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=10.24s)]
*  He's the first president since Grover Cleveland in 1892 [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=12.24s)]
*  to win a non-consecutive second term. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=15.88s)]
*  But Trump would rather compare himself to William McKinley, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  who came after Cleveland and was a natural businessman, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=20.78s)]
*  to quote Trump from his inauguration speech on Monday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=23.68s)]
*  Now, McKinley, who was a proud American imperialist, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=26.42s)]
*  assassinated in 1901 and succeeded by Teddy Roosevelt, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=29.18s)]
*  is set to have his name put back on Mount Denali [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=33.26s)]
*  in just one of a dizzying number of executive orders [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=36.4s)]
*  that Trump made on his first day back in office. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=39.1s)]
*  Who better to talk about the unprecedented historical moment [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=41.8s)]
*  that Americans find themselves in [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=44.56s)]
*  than a historian who has made a name for herself [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=46.44s)]
*  as a prolific writer on Substack, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  where she has over a million followers [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=50.3s)]
*  for her nightly letter from an American. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=52.1s)]
*  She's also a professor and a bestselling author [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=54.24s)]
*  who interviewed President Biden twice. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=56.58s)]
*  Heather Cox Richardson joins me now. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=58.540000000000006s)]
*  Thank you so much, Heather, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=60.74s)]
*  for joining me on Mayor the Unfiltered. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=61.78s)]
*  It's such a pleasure to be here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  So looking back, Heather, on all of the inaugurations [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=65.68s)]
*  you have watched in your life, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=70.68s)]
*  not just as a professor and a historian, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=71.92s)]
*  but in your entire life, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=73.16s)]
*  where does Monday stand in comparison? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  How does it compare [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=78.06s)]
*  to other American presidential inaugurations? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=79.10000000000001s)]
*  It's really different in one very obvious way, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=82.64s)]
*  and that is that usually an inauguration speech [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=85.04s)]
*  is designed to bring the country together [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=87.72s)]
*  and to put behind the rancor of the campaign [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=89.36s)]
*  that came before it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=92.6s)]
*  And of course, Trump didn't do that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=93.8s)]
*  He doubled down on what he did during the campaign. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=95.76s)]
*  I thought that was interesting. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=98.74s)]
*  I thought more interesting was what happened immediately [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=100.08s)]
*  after that when he spoke to a smaller group [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=102.44s)]
*  of his followers in an adjoining room [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=104.44s)]
*  to where he had given that speech in the rotunda [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=106.42s)]
*  in the same place where the people [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=109.02s)]
*  who had supported him in 2021 [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=110.86s)]
*  tried to overturn the government. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=112.76s)]
*  And in that second speech, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=114.5s)]
*  it was interesting to me because it was not scripted. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=116.64s)]
*  It was all over the map. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=119.28s)]
*  It was off the wall, very hard to follow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=120.88s)]
*  And I think more of what we're really grappling with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=123.42s)]
*  in this new administration [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=126.38s)]
*  than that canned speech that came before. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=127.88s)]
*  So Heather, given he gave that second speech, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=130.76s)]
*  then he gave another speech at the Capitol arena. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=133.72s)]
*  He chatted to journalists. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=135.6s)]
*  He said a lot of stuff. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=136.46s)]
*  He did a lot of stuff. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=137.66s)]
*  He signed a record number of executive orders. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=138.86s)]
*  You know that Steve Bannon has talked about flooding [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=141.1s)]
*  the zone with shit. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=143.46s)]
*  Stephen Miller has talked about that being the strategy [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  for the second term. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=147.46s)]
*  There's a blitz of stuff from birthright citizenship [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=148.7s)]
*  to all of the other stuff that's going on, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=151.76s)]
*  the border emergency. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=154.2s)]
*  What's one thing perhaps stood out to you [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=156.98s)]
*  above everything else that you heard [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=159.84s)]
*  or saw him do since Monday? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  Again, what stood out to me was that he doesn't seem to me [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=164.32s)]
*  to be fully on his pins. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=166.96s)]
*  That is, if you think about the, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=168.52s)]
*  I think it's 78 executive orders at this point, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=171.44s)]
*  they have largely been messaging to his base [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=173.83999999999997s)]
*  that he was going to do the sorts of things [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=176.82s)]
*  that he promised to do. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, if you actually read them, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=179.98s)]
*  a lot of them are already being challenged. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  It looks like they really were in many ways signaling. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=182.77999999999997s)]
*  I'm not to suggest here [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=185.56s)]
*  that people aren't gonna get hurt by them. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=186.95999999999998s)]
*  But it seems once again that he's trying to bring [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  his professional wrestling performance [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=191.89999999999998s)]
*  back to the White House. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=193.94s)]
*  And one of the things that's really interesting [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=195.06s)]
*  in this moment is to me, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=197.16s)]
*  is that it's very easy to break things. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=198.66s)]
*  It's much harder to rebuild them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=202.34s)]
*  And you can see this, I think, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=204.34s)]
*  in the January 6th pardons that he delivered, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=205.7s)]
*  the pardoning of everybody, the blanket pardons. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  A lot of people voted for Trump with the understanding [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=211.88s)]
*  that he really wasn't gonna do the things [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=214.48s)]
*  he said he was gonna do, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=216.01999999999998s)]
*  that this was all window dressing. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=217.32s)]
*  And now he is actually doing them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=218.98s)]
*  I think the combination of the fact [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=221.22s)]
*  he is himself seemingly not at the top of his game [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=223.62s)]
*  and he's delivering things that many people expected [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=227.42s)]
*  is gonna mean he's gonna face a lot of unrest [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=230.68s)]
*  a lot more quickly than a new administration usually does. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, the number of liberals, progressives [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=237.52s)]
*  who told me during the election campaign, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=239.72s)]
*  oh, Smethy, stop taking him literally. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=241.32s)]
*  He just says this stuff. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=242.8s)]
*  It's not really gonna happen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=243.64000000000001s)]
*  And here he is on day two, night one, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  pardoning violent insurrectionists, domestic terrorists, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=248.32s)]
*  as he said he would, to be fair. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=252.12s)]
*  He mentioned William McKinley, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=255.28s)]
*  the 25th president of the United States, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  very favorably in his inauguration speech. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=258.8s)]
*  A lot of people don't know McKinley. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=261.12s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about William McKinley, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=262.92s)]
*  his presidency, and why it is you think Trump likes him? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=265.38s)]
*  Yes, I can. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=269.56s)]
*  And it just astonishes me that William McKinley [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=270.68s)]
*  is having the moment he is right now. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=273.72s)]
*  Trump is actually confusing two things [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=276.0s)]
*  in William McKinley's life. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=278.08000000000004s)]
*  One is his career as a representative, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=279.2s)]
*  member of the House of Representatives, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  where he was chair of Ways and Means. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=283.3s)]
*  And as chair of Ways and Means, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=285.0s)]
*  there was an enormous pushback in America in the late 1880s [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=286.6s)]
*  against the tariffs that were protecting big business, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=291.24s)]
*  which was colluding to raise prices [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=293.68s)]
*  against ordinary Americans. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=295.36s)]
*  The Republicans promised to, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=298.12s)]
*  when they elected Benjamin Harrison, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  they promised that they would, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  what they called, reform the tariff, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=303.76000000000005s)]
*  which they understood, people understood to mean [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  that the tariff numbers would come down, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  that the levies would come down, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  making products more affordable for other Americans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=311.92s)]
*  In fact, under William McKinley [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=314.64s)]
*  in the House of Representatives, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=316.08s)]
*  they raised those tariffs. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=317.36s)]
*  That's the 1890 William McKinley tariff, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=319.0s)]
*  or the McKinley tariff. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=321.32s)]
*  And it was so unpopular, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=322.64s)]
*  the Republicans got just swept out of everything in 1892. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=324.28s)]
*  So one of the things that happens [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  when they sweep the Republicans out in 92 [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=330.64s)]
*  is there's a Republican who actually writes a letter [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=332.91999999999996s)]
*  to the president and says, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=335.32s)]
*  well, at least we've gotten rid of that no good, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=336.32s)]
*  no talent William McKinley. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=339.8s)]
*  McKinley is re-elected, or is elected as president in 1896. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=342.72s)]
*  And what he really represents [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=347.48s)]
*  is this extraordinary turnover of the government [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  to big business at the time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=352.12s)]
*  And in fact, the government is funded by big business [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=353.84000000000003s)]
*  and there is enormous, I'm sorry, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=356.74s)]
*  the government works with big business [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=358.36s)]
*  and there is enormous unrest over that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=360.26000000000005s)]
*  And when McKinley is elected, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=364.48s)]
*  it looks as if America is headed toward a civil war [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  between workers and employers and industrialists. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=368.6s)]
*  And one of the things that makes that so it doesn't happen [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=373.16s)]
*  is the discovery of gold in the Yukon [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=376.18s)]
*  because that begins to flood back into the country [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=378.02000000000004s)]
*  and changes the financial situation. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  But I think what Trump is really doing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=382.48s)]
*  when he doubles down on McKinley is he's saying, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  I want a world again where a few rich guys run everything. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=387.32000000000005s)]
*  And that's great, that's when everybody's really rich. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  And what he misses is that that's when a very few people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=393.64000000000004s)]
*  were really rich and children are working in the factories [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=396.5s)]
*  and losing their limbs and people can't have educations [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=399.98s)]
*  and they live in tenements. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=403.38s)]
*  And this is where we got the progressive era. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=404.5s)]
*  So it's this weird like funhouse vision of William McKinley [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=407.18s)]
*  both has himself a great leader. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=411.78s)]
*  He was really known as being in the pockets [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=414.24s)]
*  of the industrialists and this attempt [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=416.34s)]
*  to redefine the Gilded Age, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=419.24s)]
*  which has historically not been remembered well [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=421.02s)]
*  as this moment that we wanna get back to. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=424.04s)]
*  And I just have never in my entire career [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=426.6s)]
*  seen anybody who said, gee, it was really great [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=429.72s)]
*  to have seven year olds working in the factories. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=432.32s)]
*  Let's go back to that. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=435.12s)]
*  Although maybe Sarah Huckabee Sanders [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=436.84s)]
*  and some Republican governments may want us to go back [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=438.28s)]
*  to that in terms of child labor. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=440.24s)]
*  It's interesting, I wonder someone like Trump [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=441.6s)]
*  when the assassination attempts happened last year, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=443.64s)]
*  maybe that makes him think more about William McKinley [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=445.8s)]
*  who was assassinated in office. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=447.88s)]
*  Maybe that's more him putting himself back in history, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=449.0s)]
*  not that he knows very much about history. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=452.4s)]
*  McKinley of course was also the president on whose watch [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=454.0s)]
*  American imperialism really ramps up [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=456.64s)]
*  in terms of building an empire. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=459.28s)]
*  And Trump spoke about putting a flag on Mars [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=461.44s)]
*  during his speech, which appealed of course [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=465.12s)]
*  to Elon Musk in the audience. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=467.17999999999995s)]
*  Trump called it America's manifest destiny. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=468.62s)]
*  Heather, why should we be concerned by that phrase? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=472.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, we should be concerned about that phrase [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=475.44s)]
*  for a number of reasons. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=477.14s)]
*  But one of the points that is important here [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=478.26s)]
*  is that William McKinley in fact is associated [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=480.42s)]
*  with imperialism, the late 19th century American imperialism [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=483.22s)]
*  that led to the American Navy ending up in places [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  like the Philippines for example. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=490.42s)]
*  And it's important to remember that the McKinley tariff [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=492.46000000000004s)]
*  changes the tariff walls around the country, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=496.40000000000003s)]
*  including putting up new tariff walls [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=499.5s)]
*  on a certain kind of refined sugar [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=501.72s)]
*  that comes into the country. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=503.66s)]
*  And sugar was the most profitable trust [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=504.66s)]
*  in that period in the 1890s. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  So one of the reasons that people are willing [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=509.84s)]
*  to take over sugar producing islands, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=512.92s)]
*  like Guam for example, is because they can then bring [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=516.36s)]
*  in those products without having to go through those tariffs. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=521.92s)]
*  One of the things that I would look for with Trump's tariffs [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=524.88s)]
*  is always a financial dimension of it. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=527.58s)]
*  When he threatens to put on a tariff, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=530.1s)]
*  I wonder to what degree he will simply be shaking down [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=531.9s)]
*  an industry to say, hey, come over here [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=534.7s)]
*  and you're not gonna have to worry [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=537.38s)]
*  about those tariffs anymore. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=538.6s)]
*  And that may in fact be part of what he's doing with Canada. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=539.9s)]
*  That's different than the whole idea of manifest destiny, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=542.82s)]
*  which happens in the 1840s and the 1850s [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  and is largely a concept that comes [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=548.46s)]
*  out of the American South. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=551.9s)]
*  And that's the idea of empowering individual white men [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=553.38s)]
*  to take over lands and take over the property [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=557.7s)]
*  of their neighbors. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=561.26s)]
*  And that is based not only on economics, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=562.24s)]
*  the idea of spreading, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=564.5s)]
*  they didn't call it capitalism at the time, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=566.34s)]
*  but spreading a certain kind of trade economy. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=568.06s)]
*  It's based in religion, the idea of spreading Protestantism [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=570.0999999999999s)]
*  instead of Catholicism into places like the regions [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=573.0999999999999s)]
*  where the Catholic church had been very active. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=576.14s)]
*  And of course, it's also predicated on race. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=578.6999999999999s)]
*  The idea that white people should oversee the actions [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=580.86s)]
*  of people of color and of people [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=585.66s)]
*  of what they considered lesser religion. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=588.4599999999999s)]
*  So that's gonna be Mexicans and indigenous Americans [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=590.38s)]
*  primarily in the American West. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  And that idea that somehow America is special [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=596.44s)]
*  with its democracy, its economy, its religion [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=600.08s)]
*  and its race is going to be extraordinarily potent [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=603.76s)]
*  in the 1840s and the 1850s. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=607.24s)]
*  And where it's gonna lead, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=609.24s)]
*  and I think this is an important piece of it, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=610.6s)]
*  where it's gonna lead is the idea that so long as people, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=613.08s)]
*  and by that they mean white men, vote for something, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=617.44s)]
*  that's what the country should do. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=621.4s)]
*  And of course, what they are voting for is [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=623.12s)]
*  to take over the lands first of indigenous people, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=625.88s)]
*  but also of Mexicans and soon to be Mexican Americans. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=628.3s)]
*  And that's gonna get written into our history [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=631.74s)]
*  as late as the 1890s. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=633.9399999999999s)]
*  The idea that you will see in places [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=635.78s)]
*  like Frederick Jackson Turner's frontier thesis [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=637.74s)]
*  that slavery was a blip. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=641.62s)]
*  It really didn't matter because what really mattered [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=643.06s)]
*  was that people voted for it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=645.72s)]
*  People again, being white men voted for it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=647.18s)]
*  And that's a real upholding of American traditions. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  I think that's incredibly dangerous. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=652.34s)]
*  And it's one thing I don't think we focus enough on [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=655.0799999999999s)]
*  by nowadays recognizing how heinous things [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=658.4799999999999s)]
*  like the institution of human enslavement was. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  We forget that there's a long period of American history [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=664.88s)]
*  where people celebrated that as a triumph of democracy, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=667.9599999999999s)]
*  not as a perversion of it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=672.28s)]
*  And that's what's inherent in manifest destiny. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=673.8599999999999s)]
*  And while the William McKinley is different than that, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=676.6999999999999s)]
*  Trump obviously is picking up on those impulses, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=680.3399999999999s)]
*  even though I suspect he would not make it through [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=683.76s)]
*  his master's comps to try and differentiate [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=686.66s)]
*  between those two things. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=689.24s)]
*  Well, I was gonna ask you about that. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=691.18s)]
*  I mean, Donald Trump, you know, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=692.52s)]
*  prior to maybe a few months ago, a few years ago, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=695.52s)]
*  would have no clue who William McKinley was. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=698.18s)]
*  He wouldn't know if he was an employee [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=700.68s)]
*  of the Trump organization. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=701.7s)]
*  He had never heard the phrases manifest destiny, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=703.26s)]
*  I'm sure in his life. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=705.24s)]
*  Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=707.22s)]
*  these are the kind of people who feed him these ideas. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=709.26s)]
*  You mentioned, you know, a lot of this is predicated [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=711.08s)]
*  on race, on white men. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=712.78s)]
*  Stephen Miller obviously had a great input [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=714.36s)]
*  into that inauguration speech, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=715.9599999999999s)]
*  just like he did in the 2017 American carnage one. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=717.0799999999999s)]
*  How worried are you about the influence [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=720.1999999999999s)]
*  of some of these ideologues behind Trump? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=722.68s)]
*  Well, I'm terribly worried about it. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=726.16s)]
*  And I would worry even more about Peter Thiel, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=727.28s)]
*  Curtis Yarvin, John Musk, the tech pros [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=729.8399999999999s)]
*  who are making common cause with the mega Republicans [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=733.28s)]
*  because they both share an interest [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=736.28s)]
*  in destroying the federal government. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=737.88s)]
*  That's where they're really able to work together. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=739.26s)]
*  You can already see that splitting apart by the way, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=742.3s)]
*  where I am less concerned than I expected to be [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=744.74s)]
*  after only two days now of this administration [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=748.6999999999999s)]
*  is where we started. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=751.38s)]
*  The performative nature of the executive orders, for example, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=753.66s)]
*  is suggesting to me that the danger is less in this moment. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=759.0s)]
*  And again, we don't know what's gonna happen in the future, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=764.16s)]
*  but it's less in their ability to use the federal government [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=766.62s)]
*  in such a way that it forces upon everybody [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=769.9s)]
*  a reality that, or a governmental system that we don't want. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=773.88s)]
*  As much as it is in, again, where I started, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=777.76s)]
*  that it's very easy to break things. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=780.68s)]
*  It's very easy to fire the head of the Coast Guard [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=782.18s)]
*  and the head of the TSA [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=785.64s)]
*  and to say that the FDA can't do things. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=786.92s)]
*  It's very easy to stop things from happening. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=788.84s)]
*  It's harder to build them. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=792.6s)]
*  And that simple destruction that I think Trump [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=793.76s)]
*  and his people are engaging in already [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  is gonna be a real problem for a lot of people. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=800.5400000000001s)]
*  Now we'll see what happens when they start to try [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=803.5s)]
*  to use the federal government to do things [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=805.98s)]
*  like conduct mass deportations, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=807.9s)]
*  how effective they are at that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=810.02s)]
*  I'm sure people are gonna get hurt. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=811.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm not gonna take a bet on how efficient that's gonna be. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=816.5s)]
*  You mentioned Elon Musk, who is the richest man in the world, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=820.5s)]
*  owner of the most influential messaging platform [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=823.46s)]
*  on the planet and is now [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=825.58s)]
*  an official American government advisor. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=826.94s)]
*  Is there a precedent, Heather, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=829.24s)]
*  for someone like Elon Musk in American history? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=831.22s)]
*  I mean, the Rockefellers, Henry Ford, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=834.46s)]
*  none of them come close, do they? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=836.22s)]
*  Is there anyone like Musk that we've seen before [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=837.46s)]
*  in American history? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=839.3s)]
*  Well, we can point to people for sure. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=841.26s)]
*  I mean, you think about the elite Southern enslavers. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=843.26s)]
*  They had their advisors. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=845.54s)]
*  People like William McKinley, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=847.1s)]
*  and before him, Benjamin Harrison, had Andrew Carnegie. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=848.54s)]
*  I mean, you certainly had these people, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=852.3s)]
*  but there's a really big difference between them [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=853.84s)]
*  and somebody like the tech bros that we're talking about, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=856.24s)]
*  like Elon Musk, who first of all has at his disposal, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=858.74s)]
*  apparently now, the most powerful government in the world. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=862.34s)]
*  When we talk about Andrew Carnegie, for example, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=865.72s)]
*  the US government is important in America. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=868.1800000000001s)]
*  It's not terribly important [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  in the rest of the world at that point. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=872.62s)]
*  We don't yet have a big global footprint, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  and we won't until really after World War II. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=876.86s)]
*  So there's that problem. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  There is also the problem that even though Carnegie [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=881.32s)]
*  did write for the papers or some of the later people [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=884.0s)]
*  in the 1920s had some media reach, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=887.2s)]
*  we have the problem of the fact that these tech bros [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=890.24s)]
*  have control over very large digital platforms [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  that determine many of the ways in which we live. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=897.5200000000001s)]
*  They also determine our public speech, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=899.6400000000001s)]
*  and that is truly frightening. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=902.1600000000001s)]
*  It is truly frightening, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=906.0200000000001s)]
*  and this is the era we're entering now. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=907.32s)]
*  And in many ways, it is sui generis, as you point out. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  America wasn't like America before. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  There were figures like Musk, but not quite like Musk, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=915.7s)]
*  and Trump is Trump, and that's where you and I agree a lot. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=917.8000000000001s)]
*  During the first Trump presidency, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=922.4000000000001s)]
*  a lot of people looked to historians, scholars of fascism [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=924.24s)]
*  for context, for history. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=928.5400000000001s)]
*  And this is not a country, let's be honest, Heather, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=930.12s)]
*  and I say this as an American citizen [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=931.9200000000001s)]
*  who's an immigrant from abroad, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=933.4200000000001s)]
*  this is not a country that really studies history [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=935.1600000000001s)]
*  very closely or has a long memory. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=937.62s)]
*  There's a real goldfish tendency to a lot of Americans. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=940.62s)]
*  So people like yourself and Kevin Cruz [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=942.9200000000001s)]
*  and Ruth Ben-Giag, a friend of mine, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=946.36s)]
*  became very prominent during the Trump era [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=947.86s)]
*  for giving historical context [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=949.36s)]
*  from both other countries and the US, got big followings. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=950.76s)]
*  And then you got critics as well, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=955.0s)]
*  as is the nature of things. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=956.64s)]
*  And some people say they call you Twitterstorians, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=958.0s)]
*  dismissively, or resistance historians. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=961.14s)]
*  And their argument against people like yourself, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=964.1800000000001s)]
*  and I wanted to get your response, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=966.44s)]
*  is that you give Democrats a pass [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=967.84s)]
*  and suggest Donald Trump is an aberration in US history [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=970.72s)]
*  when in actual fact, he's a product [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=974.84s)]
*  of bipartisan US institutions and of American capitalism. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=977.48s)]
*  And I just wanted to get, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=981.38s)]
*  what is your response to people who say that? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=982.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, I would not say [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=985.6600000000001s)]
*  that he is completely divorced from American history at all. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=987.7s)]
*  I've argued just the opposite, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=991.7600000000001s)]
*  that he is a continuation of the Republican rhetoric [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=993.0400000000001s)]
*  since the 1980s. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=995.7s)]
*  But I think you're asking a larger question [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=997.48s)]
*  and that is, there are two larger questions there. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=999.1s)]
*  The touchdown for me is not partisanship, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  it's not Democrats or Republicans, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1007.8s)]
*  it is who is currently a threat to American democracy. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1009.68s)]
*  And that right now is the MAGA party, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1013.24s)]
*  which I've said repeatedly is not the same thing [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  as traditional Republicans. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1016.9399999999999s)]
*  And that, I can't speak for other historians, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1018.98s)]
*  but that to me is what's really at stake here, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1022.16s)]
*  not Republicans or Democrats or independents [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1025.28s)]
*  or any political party. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1027.62s)]
*  Democracy itself. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1029.56s)]
*  What's at stake here, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  which are, I'm sorry. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1031.6399999999999s)]
*  Democracy itself you're focused on. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1032.9799999999998s)]
*  Yes, and the principles of our foundational documents. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1034.9399999999998s)]
*  But I think there's a larger question there [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1038.2199999999998s)]
*  for the profession and that is, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1040.12s)]
*  there's two ways to look at what we do as scholars, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1042.4799999999998s)]
*  not as teachers, which I think is a third question. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1045.06s)]
*  And that is, do you support a political party, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1048.1s)]
*  which is something that someone like Arthur Selassie Jr. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1051.1999999999998s)]
*  insisted was the case, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1053.7399999999998s)]
*  that in fact historians should throw their weight [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1055.1399999999999s)]
*  in his case with the Democratic party [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  because that was the wave of the future. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1059.34s)]
*  Or should you do what somebody like John Hope Franklin [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1062.42s)]
*  argued very well, I think, in the historian, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1064.82s)]
*  should you try to identify what historians actually do, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1067.8s)]
*  which is the patterns of American, in this case, history, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1070.9s)]
*  to illuminate the present without taking a side necessarily. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1074.3s)]
*  And people disagree about that. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1078.18s)]
*  And people who I respect a lot disagree about that. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1079.54s)]
*  But I'm with John Hope Franklin on that, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1083.02s)]
*  that what we do as historians is we say, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1084.62s)]
*  here are some patterns and here are the patterns [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1087.02s)]
*  that may or may not have resonance today. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1089.6s)]
*  And that doesn't suggest that any historian [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1092.6s)]
*  has a monopoly on those. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1095.0s)]
*  So we have different ways we look at the world. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1096.54s)]
*  And I would suggest that the more voices we get, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1099.1799999999998s)]
*  not only from history, but also from literature [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1102.62s)]
*  and from art and from music, from American culture, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1104.82s)]
*  in ways that has tended to be neglected [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1107.96s)]
*  over the last several decades, is really valuable [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1110.1799999999998s)]
*  because people might listen to me and think, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1113.06s)]
*  oh man, she's nailed that pattern, it's really great. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1114.6999999999998s)]
*  This is the way I should think about the world. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1118.12s)]
*  And somebody else is gonna say, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1119.78s)]
*  she is completely out to lunch, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1121.26s)]
*  she has completely missed this issue [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1123.02s)]
*  that is much more important. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1125.4599999999998s)]
*  And neither one of those are necessarily wrong. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1126.9199999999998s)]
*  They need to be in dialogue with each other. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1129.8s)]
*  And I love that we are now listening to voices again, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  that for so long, just simply we're getting no traction [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1135.3s)]
*  at all in popular America. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1139.4599999999998s)]
*  I have to say, well, I laugh a little bit at the idea [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1141.54s)]
*  we got huge followings. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1145.6999999999998s)]
*  Because we still are historians. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1148.1799999999998s)]
*  It is really shocking to me the degree to which [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1151.06s)]
*  so many people who simply paid no attention to history [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1154.02s)]
*  at all before this moment, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1157.1s)]
*  literally paid no attention to history at all [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1159.06s)]
*  before this moment are sort of waking up and saying, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1161.1399999999999s)]
*  maybe William McKinley matters, why does he matter? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1164.1399999999999s)]
*  And that I think is very healthy because until the 1960s, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1166.82s)]
*  people did read history, they did care about history. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1171.6999999999998s)]
*  They learned quite a bit about it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1174.1s)]
*  And I think it really matters. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1175.5s)]
*  No disagreement for me on that for sure. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1178.02s)]
*  You interviewed President Biden twice, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1181.1399999999999s)]
*  including once last year. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1183.4199999999998s)]
*  And last summer after that disastrous debate of his, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1185.5s)]
*  you were one of the people who was saying [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1189.46s)]
*  he didn't need to step aside. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1190.6599999999999s)]
*  And it might be a mistake if he steps aside. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1191.98s)]
*  There was a whole intense debate. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1194.34s)]
*  We were all involved in it taking different positions. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1195.62s)]
*  We've learned recently from the New York Times [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1198.78s)]
*  that Biden's team were keeping negative polls away from him. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1201.54s)]
*  They were surrounding him with aides, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1205.78s)]
*  the news cameras wouldn't capture his quote awkward bearing [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1207.54s)]
*  when he walked outside. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1210.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm just wondering, given you, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1212.58s)]
*  I didn't get a chance to interview the president last year, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1214.22s)]
*  when you met with him, what was he like? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1216.3s)]
*  Did you at the time now looking back [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1218.1399999999999s)]
*  with the benefit of hindsight think, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1219.62s)]
*  actually there was an issue with his age [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1221.26s)]
*  or his competence or his health? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1223.1s)]
*  No, I didn't at all. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1225.74s)]
*  And I again, look at accomplishments [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1227.66s)]
*  and that administration accomplished [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1231.7s)]
*  extraordinary amounts of stuff. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1233.98s)]
*  So as I said to somebody, if this is age, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1235.8600000000001s)]
*  give us more of it. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1239.02s)]
*  What I did see is somebody who has a stutter [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1241.42s)]
*  and that a dear friend of mine [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1244.3s)]
*  has quite a serious stutter as well. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1247.06s)]
*  And so I'm accustomed to listening to that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1249.58s)]
*  I think what is one of the issues [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1252.58s)]
*  about talking to historians is that [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1255.7s)]
*  if anybody interpreted what I was saying last year [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1257.78s)]
*  as a defense of Biden, that was a mistake. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1261.14s)]
*  And I think if you look back over, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1264.62s)]
*  you will see what I was saying was that Biden [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1266.3799999999999s)]
*  and Vice President Kamala Harris had managed [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1270.1399999999999s)]
*  to nail together a coalition that there's a reason [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1272.3799999999999s)]
*  that they were the president and the vice president [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1276.3s)]
*  and that that was going to be extraordinarily hard [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1278.22s)]
*  to replicate. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1280.94s)]
*  I think Vice President Harris tried to do that [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1281.78s)]
*  by putting Minnesota Governor Tim Walz next to her. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1283.7s)]
*  But what I said was that when you change [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1287.62s)]
*  the way you see this late in the game, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1291.46s)]
*  it's very, very difficult to keep that coalition together. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1293.14s)]
*  And so I recognize that if you got rid of Biden [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1297.02s)]
*  and didn't put Harris in there, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1301.1000000000001s)]
*  you would have completely splintered that coalition. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1303.94s)]
*  And in retrospect, of course there are always things [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1306.5800000000002s)]
*  that you can sit back later and say, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1311.26s)]
*  oh, they could have done this, they could have done that. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1312.94s)]
*  But in a way, the idea of not replacing him [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1314.78s)]
*  at the very end, you could argue that was justified [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1318.22s)]
*  at this point because of course she did lose. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1321.3s)]
*  Or you could say, well, he should have done this, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1323.26s)]
*  he should have done that. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1324.9799999999998s)]
*  I was just suggesting that if you looked [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1326.02s)]
*  at the few occasions in which we had something like that, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1327.8999999999999s)]
*  Humphrey, primarily, you'd have a problem. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1331.4599999999998s)]
*  And people disagreed. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1334.02s)]
*  And like I say, that's, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1335.34s)]
*  disagreement's a good thing, I think. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1339.02s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1340.86s)]
*  And now, well, I'll come to Humphrey in a second, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1341.6999999999998s)]
*  but it's interesting because of course he claims [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1343.82s)]
*  he still would have won. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1346.74s)]
*  And a lot of us is like, no, no, no, no, no, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1347.58s)]
*  you would have lost worse than Harris. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1349.02s)]
*  And of course, we'll never know. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1351.54s)]
*  We'll never know. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1352.38s)]
*  The polls suggest that he would have lost [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1353.22s)]
*  much worse than Harrison. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1354.98s)]
*  And we now know that he had much worse than Astata. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1356.38s)]
*  But anyways, history is history. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1358.82s)]
*  Biden is now history. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1360.74s)]
*  But I do wonder from the perspective of history, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1362.1000000000001s)]
*  and you mentioned the accomplishments, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1364.02s)]
*  I get a lot of heat from folks on the left [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1365.98s)]
*  because I did an interview with The Guardian in 2023 [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1368.5s)]
*  when I was promoting my book. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1371.5s)]
*  And I said, he's the most impressive president [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1372.82s)]
*  of my lifetime. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1374.5800000000002s)]
*  People always forget the second line, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1375.5800000000002s)]
*  which is compared to all the rest, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1376.8600000000001s)]
*  which is Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Donald Trump, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1378.66s)]
*  Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1380.8600000000001s)]
*  Not the highest of bars with the exception of maybe Obama. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1381.98s)]
*  And I still actually think, despite Gaza, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1385.5s)]
*  and I think his record on Gaza is shameful, unforgivable, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1387.5s)]
*  I think Harris did a Humphrey [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1390.22s)]
*  and didn't distance herself from Gaza [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1391.7s)]
*  like he didn't distance herself from Vietnam, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1393.78s)]
*  another famous counterfactual, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1395.66s)]
*  what would have happened in 68 [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1396.9s)]
*  if he had thrown LBJ under the bus. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1398.3400000000001s)]
*  But on domestic policy, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1400.6200000000001s)]
*  I will always say Biden was a very strong president. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1402.8200000000002s)]
*  I think he screwed up his legacy with the foreign policy. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1405.3400000000001s)]
*  What will historians say about that domestic policy record [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1409.22s)]
*  when it comes to things like the American Rescue Plan, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1412.5800000000002s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1415.9s)]
*  We now have Donald Trump already chest beating, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1417.22s)]
*  saying infrastructure weeks back, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1419.3400000000001s)]
*  and they're gonna take credit [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1421.02s)]
*  for a lot of the economic achievements of Biden. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1422.22s)]
*  We know that's what he did last time around. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1424.5400000000002s)]
*  Given Jimmy Carter just passed away [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1426.46s)]
*  and got a much more positive reception [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1428.6200000000001s)]
*  than many people would have imagined, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1430.7s)]
*  given how historians talk about his presidency, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1431.9s)]
*  do you think Gaza aside, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1435.14s)]
*  there might be a reevaluation [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1437.34s)]
*  of Joe Biden's domestic policy record [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1438.82s)]
*  as president going forward? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1440.54s)]
*  Well, I don't know if it needs to be a reevaluation. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1443.5s)]
*  I think what he did was earth shattering [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1446.1s)]
*  in that he took the previous 40 years of neoliberalism [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1448.7s)]
*  and supply side economics and said, this doesn't work. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1452.78s)]
*  I'm taking us back to what we did between 1933 and 1981, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1456.62s)]
*  and I'm gonna prove it works. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1459.94s)]
*  And he did. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1461.18s)]
*  I think that's why there was such incredible venom [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1462.02s)]
*  directed at him toward those people [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1464.22s)]
*  who had an interest in... [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1466.22s)]
*  We proved it worked economically. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1467.06s)]
*  Unfortunately, he didn't prove it worked politically [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1468.14s)]
*  because they lost. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1469.82s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1471.02s)]
*  That's where I think that's actually, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1471.8600000000001s)]
*  that's where I would say that the Biden administration [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1473.26s)]
*  did not measure up to the moment. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1476.34s)]
*  And I think it was understandable. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1478.14s)]
*  I think that Biden and his team made the calculation [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1480.06s)]
*  that so long as they produced things that people liked, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  that people would like that he was staying out [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1487.66s)]
*  of the limelight, that he was trying to work [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1489.98s)]
*  in a bipartisan fashion, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1491.78s)]
*  that he was trying to heal the country. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1493.02s)]
*  And what we learned was what that did [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1495.7s)]
*  is gave room for Donald Trump to be unprecedented [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1498.06s)]
*  in his use of his position as a former president, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1501.42s)]
*  essentially to run a shadow presidency [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1504.7s)]
*  that was constantly carping on the Biden administration. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1507.42s)]
*  And one of the things that I don't think we talk about, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1510.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't think we talk about that enough [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1513.82s)]
*  because presidents have traditionally backed away [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1515.3799999999999s)]
*  after they leave office [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1518.42s)]
*  and let the next president carry on as they wish. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1519.74s)]
*  Certainly Barack Obama even said [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1522.02s)]
*  he was gonna do that with Trump. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1523.74s)]
*  Go ahead, I'm not gonna stand in your way. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1525.1s)]
*  But that's important. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1527.4199999999998s)]
*  I also think it's really important [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1529.3s)]
*  that the mega Republicans were actively working [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1531.02s)]
*  to destroy the government while Biden was trying to build it. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1534.2199999999998s)]
*  And I compared it the other day to Abraham Lincoln [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1537.9399999999998s)]
*  trying to deal with the problem of westward expansion, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1541.82s)]
*  which is actually at the heart of what happens [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1544.98s)]
*  in the middle of the 19th century, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1546.74s)]
*  while the Confederates are still in the government. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1548.4599999999998s)]
*  I mean, Lincoln had the benefit of the fact [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1550.54s)]
*  that those people trying to destroy the United States left. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1552.54s)]
*  In Biden's case, they stayed. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1555.66s)]
*  And that required a different approach to politics [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1557.66s)]
*  than the Biden administration put on the table. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1561.9s)]
*  Yeah, one of them was speaker of the house for a while, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1564.7s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1566.18s)]
*  Just days after the election, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1568.06s)]
*  you went on Jon Stewart's podcast, Heather, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1569.18s)]
*  and you said the following, quote, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1570.74s)]
*  "'What this rejection of the Biden economic plan [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1572.06s)]
*  is shown to future politicians [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1574.06s)]
*  is that there is no upside in trying to invest [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1575.78s)]
*  in ordinary Americans.'" [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1578.14s)]
*  If that's the case, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1580.62s)]
*  how do you see Democrats moving forward [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1582.06s)]
*  to win back voters who have rejected them? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1584.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's worth remembering [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1588.46s)]
*  that Trump did not win 50% of the American voters. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1590.02s)]
*  More people voted for somebody else and voted for him. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1592.86s)]
*  I think there's a lot of things [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1595.86s)]
*  that we're gonna have to deal with going forward. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1597.06s)]
*  And not by we, I mean, the American people. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1599.1399999999999s)]
*  The democracy, the mechanics of our democracy [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1602.22s)]
*  are badly out of whack. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1605.46s)]
*  We know that. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1607.06s)]
*  I mean, the electoral colleges [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1607.8999999999999s)]
*  and the Supreme Court is a mess. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1609.38s)]
*  The representation in the House of Representatives, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1610.5800000000002s)]
*  if in fact it were still the way the framers [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1612.5800000000002s)]
*  of the Constitution had designed it, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1614.6200000000001s)]
*  we would have more than a thousand people [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1616.5s)]
*  in the House of Representatives. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1618.3000000000002s)]
*  Those things all need to be on the table. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1619.8200000000002s)]
*  We also have the issue of the fact [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1622.26s)]
*  that we've got a demographic change going on in the country [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1624.66s)]
*  in terms of age, I mean, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1627.1000000000001s)]
*  not only in terms of who are the people here. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1628.7s)]
*  But one of the things that I expect to see going forward [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1630.98s)]
*  is a much clearer articulation [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1633.9s)]
*  on the part of the Democratic Party [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1635.8600000000001s)]
*  of what they stand for [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1638.5s)]
*  and how they are going to implement that. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1640.14s)]
*  And by the same token, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1642.3s)]
*  the mega Republicans have articulated [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1645.42s)]
*  what they stand against. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1647.42s)]
*  And they have articulated the idea [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1648.9s)]
*  that they want to create essentially Christo-fascism [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1651.34s)]
*  and impose it on America through a strong government. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1655.98s)]
*  That is really unpopular. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1658.74s)]
*  So either they're gonna have to impose that by force [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1661.02s)]
*  or a new version of the Republican Party, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1665.54s)]
*  whether it has the name Republican or some different name [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1668.22s)]
*  is going to have to reach back into its ideology [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1671.02s)]
*  and emerge around that idea. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1674.78s)]
*  And what that looks like, at least historically, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1677.22s)]
*  is Republicans beginning in the 18, I'm sorry, 50s, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1679.38s)]
*  began to articulate a world that looks much like [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1683.22s)]
*  what Biden put in place. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1685.54s)]
*  We invest in people in the bottom, they produce a lot, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1686.98s)]
*  they support people in the middle, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1689.54s)]
*  they in turn produce more than they consume. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1691.06s)]
*  And they support a few industrialists and financiers [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1693.02s)]
*  at the top who in turn support people at the bottom, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1696.1399999999999s)]
*  hire people at the bottom. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1699.62s)]
*  The Democrats in contrast rising when they did [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1701.02s)]
*  tended to see the world as, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1704.58s)]
*  I always think of it as like a teeter totter or a seesaw. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1706.1399999999999s)]
*  There's the haves and the have nots [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1708.82s)]
*  and the role of the federal government [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1710.3799999999999s)]
*  is to balance the two between them. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1711.6599999999999s)]
*  I could absolutely see the Democrats coming around [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1713.4199999999998s)]
*  and saying, really taking advantage of the fact [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1716.1s)]
*  that Trump has doubled down on billionaires [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1718.82s)]
*  and on the support of billionaires [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1723.98s)]
*  at the very moment that Americans made clear [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1726.3400000000001s)]
*  through their support of the man who shot Brian Thompson, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1728.46s)]
*  the CEO of a healthcare insurance company, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1732.18s)]
*  that we're seeing now a populist moment [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1736.38s)]
*  based in class rather than in culture. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1739.74s)]
*  And that would be a game changer as far as I'm concerned. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1742.9s)]
*  100% agree with you. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1746.66s)]
*  Last question, final question, Heather. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1747.74s)]
*  How do we keep hope alive over the next four years? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1750.02s)]
*  The way we always have. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1753.66s)]
*  We keep hope alive by the fact [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1756.3s)]
*  that what American democracy was always about [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1757.78s)]
*  was the concept of human self-determination. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1760.8600000000001s)]
*  And the idea that we are somehow in a position [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1763.66s)]
*  that's worse than we've ever had it before. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1767.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's true in some ways, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1769.06s)]
*  but talk to African-Americans in the South [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1770.78s)]
*  between about 1874 and 1965. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1772.98s)]
*  That was no bed of roses. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1775.74s)]
*  That was a dictatorship, a one party state [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1777.02s)]
*  that gave them no rights. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1779.78s)]
*  The way that people overcame that [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1781.78s)]
*  was they worked together in communities, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1783.58s)]
*  at the local level, at the state level, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1786.22s)]
*  and they reinforced the idea [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1787.3s)]
*  that having the right to be treated equally before the law [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1789.06s)]
*  and a right to a say in your government [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1791.86s)]
*  are two of the most profound principles of humanity, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1793.9399999999998s)]
*  not just of the United States of America. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1796.98s)]
*  So I think we get out there and we continue to do [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1799.4199999999998s)]
*  what we've been doing since 2017, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1802.02s)]
*  organizing to remind people that this is our government. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1804.34s)]
*  It's not Elon Musk's, it's not the billionaires, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1807.9399999999998s)]
*  it's not a few evangelical Christians [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1810.54s)]
*  who want to impose their will on the rest of us, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1813.46s)]
*  but this is really at the end of the day up to us. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1815.66s)]
*  And in the past, we've managed to bring things around. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1818.82s)]
*  We can only hope. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1823.3400000000001s)]
*  Heather Cox Richardson, thank you so much, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1824.46s)]
*  appreciate you. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1826.42s)]
*  Nice to be here. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1828.3400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAQiePTIs-k&t=1843.46s)]
