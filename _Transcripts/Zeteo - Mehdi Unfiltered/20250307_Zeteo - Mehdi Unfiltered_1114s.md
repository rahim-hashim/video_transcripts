# ‘One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This’ - Author Omar El Akkad on Gaza
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8)
*  What does it mean to be on the right side of history? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=0.0s)]
*  Is there a statute of limitations on injustice? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=3.1s)]
*  And is it ever too late to take a stance? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=5.94s)]
*  In 2023, award-winning novelist and journalist [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=8.26s)]
*  Omar Al-Aqad published this tweet [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=11.38s)]
*  about the destruction in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=13.82s)]
*  Quote, one day when it's safe, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  when there's no personal downside [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=17.98s)]
*  to calling a thing what it is, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=19.54s)]
*  when it's too late to hold anyone accountable, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=21.22s)]
*  everyone will have always been against this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=23.46s)]
*  Those 180 characters pack a lot of meaning, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=26.54s)]
*  meaning that resonated with the 10 plus million people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=28.72s)]
*  who viewed that tweet, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=32.36s)]
*  meaning that led Al-Aqad to write an entire book [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=34.16s)]
*  titled One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=36.96s)]
*  This is his first work of nonfiction [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  and his debut novel, American War, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  was named by the BBC as one of 100 novels [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=44.32s)]
*  that shaped our world. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=46.6s)]
*  Omar joins me now from London. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=48.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  Congratulations on the book. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  I wish you didn't have to write it, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  but it's a powerful book. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=55.08s)]
*  It's a emotional book and it's an important book. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=56.220000000000006s)]
*  And I just want to start with what it is Omar, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=60.5s)]
*  but also what it isn't. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=63.18000000000001s)]
*  You write that this is not an account of that carnage [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=64.26s)]
*  that we saw in Gaza. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=67.34s)]
*  You say that you're not trying to change anyone's mind [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=68.7s)]
*  with this book. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=70.8s)]
*  So what impact do you think it'll have? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=71.86s)]
*  Do you want it to have? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=74.62s)]
*  What should readers leave with? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=75.66s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=79.94s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=80.94s)]
*  I had been writing the book sort of independent [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=82.5s)]
*  of that tweet. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=85.64s)]
*  I had actually finished the book. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=86.94s)]
*  And then afterwards, one of my editors had suggested [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=89.04s)]
*  that title for the book. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=92.76s)]
*  And so I'm going around now trying desperately [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=96.48s)]
*  to convince people that I didn't just take a tweet [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=99.32000000000001s)]
*  and sort of stretch it out into 250 pages. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=101.4s)]
*  I promise you that wasn't the case. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=103.84s)]
*  There's a reason I sound the way I do. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=108.64s)]
*  I often talk about this idea that if I called you up [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=111.16s)]
*  on the phone and said my name was John Smith, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=113.4s)]
*  you'd probably believe me because I have this accent [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=115.24s)]
*  and I'm sort of attuned to the West in a particular way. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=117.94s)]
*  And I think that has been true for essentially my entire life. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=121.58s)]
*  But over the last year and a half, I felt a kind of severance [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=126.94s)]
*  from everything that I had oriented myself towards. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=130.88s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, I'm killing those kids. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=135.4s)]
*  It's my tax money that is paying [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=139.62s)]
*  for the bombs being dropped on them. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=141.14s)]
*  And so the book, I think, is in part reckoning with that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=143.14s)]
*  and what it means to live in the West as someone with my name, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=148.48s)]
*  with my background, et cetera, but just living in the West [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=151.76s)]
*  in general and knowing that there exists this kind of chasm [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=154.06s)]
*  between the performance of virtue and the pragmatic reality. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=157.72s)]
*  And just to go back to that original tweet [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=163.66s)]
*  that inspired the title of the book, not the book itself, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=166.38s)]
*  was it frustration with the patent dishonesty [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=169.52s)]
*  or the obvious hypocrisy of the people in power [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=173.72s)]
*  that made you write that down? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=176.28s)]
*  One day everyone will have always been against us. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=178.02s)]
*  I mean, today, almost everyone in public life is [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=180.2s)]
*  against the Iraq war, but they weren't back in 2003. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=183.64s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=187.04s)]
*  Yeah, in a sense, it was sort of preemptive pattern recognition. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=190.88s)]
*  You know, it wasn't all that long ago [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  that the U.S. government issued this resolution saying, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=199.08s)]
*  essentially, sorry about all that genocide, indigenous folks, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=201.94s)]
*  and, you know, it comes centuries too late. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=205.58s)]
*  Look, one way or another, I'm going to be proven right or wrong. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=208.72s)]
*  And it doesn't much matter to me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=213.1s)]
*  That wasn't, the attempt wasn't some kind of prediction. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=214.68s)]
*  I think what I was trying to get at is that I think there's a lot [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=217.72s)]
*  of people who have become very well versed in looking away [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=222.96s)]
*  and keeping their head down and then checking every once [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  in a while to see what the prevailing opinion is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=231.0s)]
*  And I don't think that what we've seen, the horror we've seen [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=233.58s)]
*  over the last year and a half is any different from that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=236.46s)]
*  I think it's going to be subject to the same kind [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=240.10000000000002s)]
*  of after the fact self-preservation mode of ideology. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=242.26000000000002s)]
*  You just mentioned the indigenous Native American genocide. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=249.26000000000002s)]
*  In the book, you draw parallels between what we see in Gaza today [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  and events in the past. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=255.76s)]
*  And I wondered, did you, at any point while writing the book, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=257.06s)]
*  get a sense that history is repeating itself here, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=260.06s)]
*  or has the genocide in Gaza left a very different impact [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=263.68s)]
*  on people versus previous genocides? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=267.04s)]
*  I think there were certainly similarities, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=272.32s)]
*  but one of the central differences is that there's a kind [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=273.82s)]
*  of immediacy and horrific intimacy to the violence. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=277.46s)]
*  I mean, it's often been called the world's first live stream [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=283.26s)]
*  genocide, but I think for me, and again, I'm saying this [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=286.98s)]
*  as somebody who has the privilege of living [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=293.02s)]
*  on the launching end of the missiles. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=294.56s)]
*  You know, I live within the heart [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=296.28s)]
*  of the most powerful empire to have ever existed. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=298.82s)]
*  I became accustomed, for example, and conditioned to the fact [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=301.8s)]
*  that when I open up my social media feeds, and granted, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=305.34s)]
*  I'm not really on social media anymore, but if I saw a picture [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=307.61999999999995s)]
*  of a smiling Palestinian kid, it was probably [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=311.96s)]
*  because that kid had just been killed. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=313.65999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  And I think operating under the systems of power [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=316.02s)]
*  that we have generally relies in large extent on looking away. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=322.38s)]
*  And this was much, much more difficult to look away from. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=328.0s)]
*  One sentence that stood out for me in your book was [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=333.86s)]
*  when you say the starting point [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=335.86s)]
*  of history can always be shifted, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=337.1s)]
*  such that one side is always instigating, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  the other always justified in response. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=341.5s)]
*  I think Palestinians, it's fair to say, are a prime example [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  of how this can be weaponized [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=346.92s)]
*  against an entire population, entire place, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=348.12s)]
*  given what's happened there and the reasoning behind it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=350.56s)]
*  But can people still claim [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=354.82s)]
*  that they didn't know how bad it was? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=357.98s)]
*  Can they switch sides so late in the name of ignorance, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=359.92s)]
*  do you think, when it comes to Gaza? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=363.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really interesting question. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=367.44s)]
*  And my immediate answer is, from my perspective, I don't care. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=369.72s)]
*  You know, and I don't mean that as to be dismissive [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=380.68s)]
*  of your question, the exact opposite is true. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  I think it's a fascinating question precisely [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=385.38s)]
*  because I don't care. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=387.24s)]
*  There are going to be people who try to do this. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=388.74s)]
*  You know, it is very difficult to find somebody who was on board [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=392.88s)]
*  with apartheid in South Africa. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=397.54s)]
*  Everyone's against it in hindsight. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=399.66s)]
*  That avenue has always been available, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=402.90000000000003s)]
*  and I think it will be in this case. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=406.82000000000005s)]
*  But my central concern isn't the rehabilitation [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=411.08000000000004s)]
*  of anyone's reputation, my own included. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=415.3s)]
*  I mean, we're all going to be judged for what we did [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=417.4s)]
*  or didn't do in this moment. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=420.0s)]
*  My central concern is whatever the hell it takes [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=422.09999999999997s)]
*  to stop an ongoing slaughter and occupation and three-quarters [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=424.64s)]
*  of a century long injustice from continuing. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=428.0s)]
*  Gaza's genocide, Omar, for many people seems [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=432.56s)]
*  to have blurred the line between their perceptions [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party here in the U.S. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=438.28s)]
*  You being one of those people write, quote, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=441.56s)]
*  as much as the mainstream liberal parties might be far less [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=443.53999999999996s)]
*  deranged and cruel than their right-wing opponents [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=446.56s)]
*  on virtually every policy issue, it is the case [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=449.32s)]
*  of Palestinian suffering, or more precisely, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=451.79999999999995s)]
*  utter indifference to it, where the two sides seem [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=454.28s)]
*  to be most in agreement. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=459.58s)]
*  And how do you think people who are progressive [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=462.03999999999996s)]
*  on every issue except Palestine, the PEPs, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  how do you think they justify the Palestine exception [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=467.28s)]
*  in their own minds to their own consciences as Palestinians die [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  in their tens of thousands? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=472.96s)]
*  I mean, I've had some variant of this conversation many, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=476.68s)]
*  many times over the last 15 months. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=480.68s)]
*  I mean, I live in Portland. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=483.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm around a lot of liberals. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=484.46s)]
*  I'm around an overwhelming sort of ideology that is [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  in that sphere one way or another. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=490.28s)]
*  And I think for me, you know, one of the things that I've seen [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=493.79999999999995s)]
*  over and over again in the last few weeks is the same person [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=498.5s)]
*  who previously was telling me that I had to vote Democrat [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=503.52s)]
*  at all costs. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=506.9s)]
*  I had to vote Democrat because the alternative was [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=508.48s)]
*  so much worse. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=510.82s)]
*  And I understand that the alternative is worse [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=512.12s)]
*  on so many issues. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=513.42s)]
*  It's not like I wasn't around [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=514.88s)]
*  for the last Trump administration. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=516.22s)]
*  I get it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=517.64s)]
*  But that same person who appealed to our shared solidarity [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=519.22s)]
*  in trying to fix all of these things now turn around [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=523.34s)]
*  and express almost a sense of glee at every act of cruelty now [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=526.58s)]
*  that it's happening under a Republican administration, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=531.98s)]
*  you know, but you didn't vote for the Democrats. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=535.74s)]
*  Well, now you deserve the deportations. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=539.1800000000001s)]
*  And now all of the carnage in Gaza is on you. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=542.32s)]
*  That tells me two things, right? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  The first thing it tells me is that you were never my ally. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=548.22s)]
*  There was never solidarity there. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=550.5s)]
*  We just had a temporary adjacency [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  of self-interest, maybe, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=553.94s)]
*  And so I know that going forward. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=556.46s)]
*  The second thing it tells me is that if we are operating [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=558.34s)]
*  in the arena of consequences, and I don't think [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=563.82s)]
*  that the protest vote against the genocide [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=566.22s)]
*  in Gaza would have turned the election, I doubt it [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=568.72s)]
*  in the first place, but let's assume that it could. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=570.94s)]
*  If consequences are going to be applied that way [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=575.34s)]
*  to the electorate, surely that's a two-way street, right? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=577.98s)]
*  Surely sending Bill Clinton to Michigan [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=582.8000000000001s)]
*  to tell Arabs how good this all is [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=586.38s)]
*  as a campaign strategy must also come with some kind [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=589.5s)]
*  of consequences, right? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=592.2199999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, there's no universe [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  in which I'm ever voting for the Republican Party. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=597.64s)]
*  It's a deranged cult, and I want nothing to do with it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=600.68s)]
*  I have no interest in this conversation, though, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=604.62s)]
*  about how it is good enough for the only other mainstream party [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=607.06s)]
*  in this country to be slightly better than a deranged cult. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=611.4599999999999s)]
*  I'm not interested in that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=615.1s)]
*  Well said. You mentioned the Republican Party. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=616.4s)]
*  Looking at what Trump has done since his re-election [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=618.66s)]
*  as president once more makes one of the quotes [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=621.0600000000001s)]
*  in your book ring deafeningly loud. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=624.58s)]
*  You say, quote, American liberalism demands a rhetorical [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=626.34s)]
*  politeness from which the fascistic iteration [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=629.46s)]
*  of the modern Republican Party is fully free. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=631.86s)]
*  Trump's style of politics, his strongman style, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=635.22s)]
*  his abrasive style, is actually forcing a lot of U.S. allies [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=639.08s)]
*  into a weird corner where they have to kind of pick the U.S. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=643.14s)]
*  or someone else, where neutrality is no longer an option. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=646.3s)]
*  You have, you know, Egypt and Jordan now having to come out [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=648.74s)]
*  and say, look, we're not going to be part [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=651.86s)]
*  of this ethnic cleansing plan, no matter what you think, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=653.1s)]
*  no matter how much money you give us. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=654.9399999999999s)]
*  Obviously, you have the Canadas and the Mexicos trying [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=656.78s)]
*  to avoid trade wars while standing up for themselves. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=659.54s)]
*  Do you think Trump's almost abhorrent clarity and bluntness [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=662.16s)]
*  on his plans globally, but specifically [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=667.58s)]
*  for the occupied territories, is forcing others [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=669.92s)]
*  around the world, including U.S. allies, to pick a side? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=672.74s)]
*  I think so. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=678.34s)]
*  I mean, I think we underestimate. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=678.86s)]
*  And look, I have a PhD in absolutely nothing. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=680.86s)]
*  I'm a guy who writes for a living. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=683.78s)]
*  Please take all of this with a grain of salt. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  But I think that generally we underestimate just how jarring [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=686.7s)]
*  the disconnect between the performance and the reality is. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=693.5s)]
*  And with Trump, both are horrific, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=698.62s)]
*  but they're closer together. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=704.34s)]
*  You know, I can't count the number of times I woke [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=706.48s)]
*  up over the last year and a half [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=709.62s)]
*  and watched some White House press secretary talk to me [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=711.26s)]
*  about how the Democratic Party is doing more for the Palestinians [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=715.1s)]
*  than any other administration in history. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=718.84s)]
*  And you see it and you think, I don't know what's scarier, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=720.78s)]
*  that you believe the words coming out of your mouth [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=725.84s)]
*  or that you don't. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=727.66s)]
*  With Donald Trump, I think he's forcing a kind of reckoning [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=729.0799999999999s)]
*  that is entirely due to there being so very little room [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  between the cruelty as it is expressed [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=738.18s)]
*  and the cruelty as it is enacted. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  And it is, it's almost a kind of lightness. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=743.8s)]
*  It's a terrible, terrible lightness to see somebody [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=748.6s)]
*  who doesn't even bother with the mask [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=751.62s)]
*  because the face itself is so ugly. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=754.38s)]
*  Let's talk about the media. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=758.2199999999999s)]
*  You talk in your book, and you are a former war correspondent, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=759.52s)]
*  you reported in Afghanistan and elsewhere I know. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=761.98s)]
*  You talk in your book about the media's role [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=764.4s)]
*  in Gaza's genocide, writing, quote, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=766.12s)]
*  the entire notion of reporter as referee, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=768.28s)]
*  announcer, scorekeeper, even if it has any merit, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=770.54s)]
*  requires the game on the field to be played in accordance [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  with some set of rules. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=775.56s)]
*  It has no capacity to deal with players who kneecap. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=776.86s)]
*  Now, when I read that quote, I also think of Trump [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=779.8199999999999s)]
*  and his relation with the media. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=781.68s)]
*  But just on Gaza and Netanyahu, how much did the media fail us? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=782.98s)]
*  I think about the Iraq war and the WMD lies [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=787.36s)]
*  and the way the New York Times and others, BBC and British [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=790.0s)]
*  and American press went along with Bush and Blair. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=792.92s)]
*  Compared to that, I mean, the US media has gone even above [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=796.0s)]
*  and beyond that in terms of its failures, its complicity, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=799.6800000000001s)]
*  its mainstreaming of lies and violence. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=803.32s)]
*  How bad do you think this media failure has been if you think [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=806.4s)]
*  about our lives on this planet? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=809.48s)]
*  I think it's been instructively bad. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=810.78s)]
*  And what I mean by that is that it's not only allowed [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=815.9399999999999s)]
*  for a normalizing of carnage [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=821.1999999999999s)]
*  that I think otherwise would have been much more difficult [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  to achieve, but it has also sort of expressed something [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=827.64s)]
*  that to me I was having trouble wrapping my head [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=832.26s)]
*  around until very recently, which is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=835.06s)]
*  that when these stories come out, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  either very sensationalistic stories about very grotesque acts [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=840.9s)]
*  that later on turn out to be completely untrue or torqued [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=844.36s)]
*  in some way or in the other direction, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=847.6800000000001s)]
*  a truly grotesque act that is minimized [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=850.72s)]
*  by using passive language. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=852.96s)]
*  The bullet found its way into the car and collided [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=854.44s)]
*  with a four-year-old young lady, right? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=859.08s)]
*  In both those cases, the thing that is central for any [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=861.88s)]
*  of this to happen is not so much what any one person or group [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=867.02s)]
*  of people or population actually do, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=871.9599999999999s)]
*  but what they are believed capable of doing. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=876.14s)]
*  And I think this was the case with a lot [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=879.86s)]
*  of the really sensational and really ruinous kind [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=883.14s)]
*  of reporting early on that I think normalized and created a [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=887.38s)]
*  kind of consent for a lot of the carnage that came after, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=891.2199999999999s)]
*  is there was a far less dependent [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=894.4599999999999s)]
*  on what had actually happened than what those people [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=896.0799999999999s)]
*  over there are believed to be capable of doing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=901.42s)]
*  Once you've established that, then permissibility kind [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=903.74s)]
*  of goes through the roof. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=907.18s)]
*  And that I think was the most instructive form of failure [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=908.4799999999999s)]
*  in terms of what it told me about a lot [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=911.7199999999999s)]
*  of the major media organizations in this part of the world. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=913.42s)]
*  This is your first nonfiction book. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=918.0s)]
*  How hard is it to write, A, a nonfiction book versus fiction, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=920.0s)]
*  but also about a topic like this one? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=926.04s)]
*  It's a difficult question to answer because as soon [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=927.64s)]
*  as I start answering, I want to tell you [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=932.8s)]
*  that it's incredibly difficult, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=934.4399999999999s)]
*  just as it's been incredibly difficult to wake up every day [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=936.28s)]
*  and watch visceral proof [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=940.0s)]
*  of the worst things human beings can do to one another. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=942.64s)]
*  On the other hand, you know, I sit alone in my room [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=945.84s)]
*  and I write for a living. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=949.34s)]
*  The word difficult is doing some real heavy lifting there, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=950.96s)]
*  relatively speaking, right? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=955.04s)]
*  Good point. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to give the impression that I suffered [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=958.1s)]
*  through this great Herculean task. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=961.1800000000001s)]
*  I have done one tiny step above nothing. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=962.94s)]
*  And I, like everyone else, will have to live with that, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=968.02s)]
*  with what we did or more to the point didn't do during this [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=972.6800000000001s)]
*  moment of what I think was completely preventable carnage. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=976.52s)]
*  Just one last question you write in the book. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=981.22s)]
*  In the year or so between when I write these words [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=983.22s)]
*  and when they are published, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=985.7s)]
*  perhaps so many innocent people will have been killed. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=986.7s)]
*  So many mass graves discovered that it will not be [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=989.14s)]
*  so controversial to state plainly what is plainly known. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=991.22s)]
*  Sadly, it is still difficult [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=995.1s)]
*  to state what is plainly known even today in February 2025. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=997.0600000000001s)]
*  But I just wonder if you had started writing this book now [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1000.46s)]
*  in February 2025 to be released in February 2026, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1004.14s)]
*  would it have been any different and if so, how? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1007.94s)]
*  I was rewriting this book right until the very end. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1010.0600000000001s)]
*  I was recording the audio book and making changes as I did it, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1014.38s)]
*  which for people who have published a book, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1017.46s)]
*  the publisher does not enjoy that very much. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1019.38s)]
*  And that's in part because of factual stuff. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1023.02s)]
*  You know, it turns out you hear something [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1026.02s)]
*  or you read something and then it turns out later [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1028.42s)]
*  to be a complete fabrication. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1030.3s)]
*  But also in terms of my own complicity [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1032.1s)]
*  in what was happening, there were periods where I clearly [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1035.06s)]
*  in the text was trying to sidestep it. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1037.76s)]
*  And so I had to face that down or else not write this book. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1039.46s)]
*  I don't think I would have changed anything in terms [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1044.42s)]
*  of the overarching thesis of the book. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1050.14s)]
*  Because as much as this book barges in through the door, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1052.66s)]
*  throwing punches and obviously would not have been written, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1056.14s)]
*  were it not for the slaughter in Vesa, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1059.42s)]
*  Palestinians can tell their own stories [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1062.5s)]
*  and are telling their own stories. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1064.2s)]
*  This is a book about the West, I think, and about fissures [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1066.3000000000002s)]
*  and failures that have been around long before this moment [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1071.74s)]
*  but have been made horrifyingly clear by this moment. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1075.3400000000001s)]
*  So thematically, I don't think I would have gone [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1079.38s)]
*  in a different direction writing it now as opposed [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1081.8600000000001s)]
*  to when I was writing it a year ago. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1084.82s)]
*  Omar Al-Aqad, thank you so much. We'll have to leave it there. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1088.06s)]
*  The book is called One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJGJvNTjpR8&t=1090.26s)]
