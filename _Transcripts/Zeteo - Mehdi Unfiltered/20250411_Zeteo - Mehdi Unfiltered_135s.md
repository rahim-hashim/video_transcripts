# TRUMP FOOLED VOTERS ON PEACE
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE)
*  In February, you wrote a piece headlined, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump's peace efforts should be a wake-up call for Dems, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  and that he's running circles around the left, you said. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=5.64s)]
*  This is the man who, since that peace treaty, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=8.28s)]
*  has allowed Israel to violate the ceasefire, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=10.56s)]
*  kill hundreds of Palestinian children, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=12.6s)]
*  while he himself was bragging just the other day [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=14.56s)]
*  about bombing and killing hundreds of people in Yemen [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=17.44s)]
*  who may or may not have been Houthi fighters. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=20.04s)]
*  Do you feel a little bit naive, a little bit foolish, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=22.88s)]
*  to have put that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Trump's peace efforts, I went back and read it, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=28.439999999999998s)]
*  I wonder how he feels now, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=30.16s)]
*  that you thought he was anti-war or pro-peace, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  when someone was like, come on, he wasn't. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=34.0s)]
*  The full piece, if you see what I wrote there, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  is talking about the fact that he went out there [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=38.64s)]
*  and he was making statements such as peace is the biggest, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=41.04s)]
*  the most important element on my legacy. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=43.64s)]
*  You know, of course, of course. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  What did the Dems say? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=47.36s)]
*  What I was trying to point out in this piece is, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=48.68s)]
*  and I say, undeservingly or not, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  he's taking the space of claiming [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=53.04s)]
*  that he's the peace candidate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=55.4s)]
*  And he did that during the campaign, right? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  Whereas Kamala Harris goes around and says, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=58.28s)]
*  no, hold on, hold on, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  I want the most lethal military force in the world. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=61.96s)]
*  Don't use the word peace. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=64.16s)]
*  I went back and looked, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=65.12s)]
*  and the last time you actually had someone [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=66.12s)]
*  getting close to using that language was Obama saying, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=67.92s)]
*  I don't want stupid words. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=71.68s)]
*  So we can agree on- [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=72.64s)]
*  But the point of that article is, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=73.48s)]
*  the Dems need to step up- [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=75.56s)]
*  Left a space for him. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  And actually make sure that they're taking the space, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  instead of leaving it empty for someone [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=80.56s)]
*  who may not at all deserve it, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=82.08s)]
*  and particularly mindful of what you're saying, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=83.52000000000001s)]
*  that's a strong case to be made. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=85.44s)]
*  But the space was left empty by the Democrats. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=86.92s)]
*  So I half agree with you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=88.8s)]
*  You're right, the space was left. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=89.64s)]
*  We don't disagree on that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=90.88s)]
*  Criticism of Harris is totally legitimate. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=92.52s)]
*  And he did go to Michigan, remember, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  before the election, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=95.76s)]
*  and said, I'm gonna be the peace candidate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=96.6s)]
*  Liz Cheney wants to drag Muslims into wars. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna be the anti-war guy. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=100.16s)]
*  All lies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=101.4s)]
*  My problem is, you can say the Democrats left a space [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=103.2s)]
*  without ever accepting the idea [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=106.72s)]
*  that he's some kind of peace guy or anti-war guy. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=108.64s)]
*  When you say Trump's peace efforts, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=110.92s)]
*  that implies there's some good faith to it, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=112.88s)]
*  that they're real. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=114.68s)]
*  I mean, that ceasefire was fake from the get-go. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=115.56s)]
*  It was just for the inauguration. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  He was never gonna restrain Netanyahu. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=118.44s)]
*  We're talking to each other on a day [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=120.12s)]
*  that Netanyahu's been welcomed to DC with a red carpet. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  So he kind of did fool a lot of people who thought, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=123.88s)]
*  oh, maybe he'll be less hawkish than Harrison Biden. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLmJjwFwxhE&t=127.36s)]
