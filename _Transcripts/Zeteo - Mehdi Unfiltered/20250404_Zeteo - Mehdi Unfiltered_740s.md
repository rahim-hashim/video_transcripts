Video Description: “The list is growing, unfortunately, because it affects what we consider to be something very innately American… Our freedom of speech and the government weaponizing the immigration process to clamp down on dissent. And make no mistake — we're not talking about the preexisting exceptions to free speech where inciting hatred, etc. — we are talking about constitutionally protected political speech.”

Mehdi Hasan speaks with Hassan Ahmad — lawyer of detained Georgetown scholar, Badar Khan Suri — about the growing list of legal immigrants targeted by the Trump administration for expressing support for Palestine, how arrests were made due to “guilt by association,” and how these attacks on the First Amendment should concern all Americans.

# Why the Trump Admin is ARRESTING Student Activists
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE)
*  Bring back free speech to America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=0.0s)]
*  Those were the words of President Donald J. Trump [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=2.5s)]
*  on his first day back in office as he promised to end all government censorship [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=4.8s)]
*  and promote the First Amendment. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=8.8s)]
*  Of course, those words couldn't have been further from the truth [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=10.5s)]
*  because not only is Trump kicking reporters out of the White House press room [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=13.4s)]
*  and going after his former critics, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=16.5s)]
*  but he's also gone as far as to detain and try and deport legal immigrants [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=18.3s)]
*  for their pro-Palestine speech, for their views. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=22.7s)]
*  Originally reported by Zateo's own political correspondent, Prem Taka, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=26.2s)]
*  these arrests first started with Mahmood Qalil, a Columbia graduate student [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=29.7s)]
*  who helped lead the university's pro-Palestinian protests. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=33.6s)]
*  And as shocking as that story was, Qalil is a green card holder, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=37.0s)]
*  that crackdown has now extended to include several others, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=40.4s)]
*  including an Indian scholar at Georgetown University, Dr. Badr Khan Suri, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=43.4s)]
*  who despite having a valid visa was taken away from his family last week [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=47.9s)]
*  outside his home in Arlington, Virginia, by MAST Homeland Security agents, MAST, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=51.6s)]
*  who at the time refused to tell him the reason for his arrest. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=56.6s)]
*  As they claimed with Qalil, the Trump administration has now accused Suri [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=59.5s)]
*  of being a mouthpiece for Hamas, claims that his family, his colleagues and his lawyer deny. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=62.6s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss the details of this case is Badr Khan Suri's lawyer, Hassan Ahmed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=68.3s)]
*  Hassan, thanks so much for coming on Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=73.4s)]
*  Before we get into the weeds and the legal arguments, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=75.6s)]
*  are there any updates you can give us on Badr's condition? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=78.7s)]
*  Is he still being held in detention? Where is he being held? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=82.1s)]
*  Have you had any communication with him? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=85.1s)]
*  Thanks for having me Mehdi. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=88.3s)]
*  And yeah, we have been able to speak with him a couple of times. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=89.7s)]
*  We have not yet been able to, although he's been in detention or detained for over a week, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=93.2s)]
*  we still have yet to schedule a confidential attorney client call. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  But I have been able to speak with him. His conditions are rough. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=104.7s)]
*  He is currently in the Prairie Land Detention Center in Texas, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=108.6s)]
*  after where he was moved to last Saturday, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=112.8s)]
*  after being at the Alexandria, Louisiana staging facility for the previous three days. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  He's already been through three or four different detention centers in the past week [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=119.7s)]
*  and is currently in Prairie Land awaiting something to happen in his case. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  You're an immigration lawyer. You've dealt with many cases where people are put in detention. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=130.7s)]
*  Just explain to our viewers, Mahmood Khalil was sent to Louisiana, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=135.0s)]
*  your client Badr Khan Suri sent to Texas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=138.3s)]
*  Mahmood Khalil was detained in New York and Badr Khan Suri in Arlington, Virginia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=141.3s)]
*  Why are they sent far away? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=144.6s)]
*  This is a game that's been played by ICE for a long, long time. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=148.2s)]
*  I remember it from when I was a young attorney, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=152.2s)]
*  sending people far away from their families, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=156.7s)]
*  sending people far away from their legal counsel, keeping them detained, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=158.5s)]
*  making it difficult for the attorneys to actually be able to represent them, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  is part of the game that the government plays, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  to break people's spirits and more quickly get orders of removal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=168.6s)]
*  And people out of this country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=174.6s)]
*  In addition to that, you'll notice that all of the detention facilities [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=177.4s)]
*  that they send people to are in Louisiana and Texas, or many of them are. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=180.4s)]
*  Usually the excuse that's given is, oh, that's the only place they have bed space. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=184.1s)]
*  Well, the only bed space that seems to be available is in the Fifth Judicial Appellate Circuit, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  and that is widely regarded to be the most anti-immigrant, toughest legal circuit to be in, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=193.4s)]
*  so that if an order of removal comes and an appeal is tried to be filed, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=200.1s)]
*  then it makes it that much more difficult to win on appeal. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=205.1s)]
*  How convenient. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=208.6s)]
*  You mentioned the other day on Blue Sky, Hassan, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=210.6s)]
*  that the letter the Trump administration used to detain Brother has still not been provided to you. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=212.7s)]
*  How cooperative or uncooperative have the authorities been on this case, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=217.6s)]
*  relative to other cases you've dealt with? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=221.4s)]
*  I've received nothing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=224.1s)]
*  I've received nothing. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=226.0s)]
*  It has been just crickets. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  It has been absolute silence from the administration. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=228.1s)]
*  This letter that supposedly was signed by Marco Rubio on March 15th has not been provided. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=230.9s)]
*  You would think that in any sort of case, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=235.7s)]
*  the charging document should contain what the allegations are. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=238.9s)]
*  In this case, it's nothing more than a naked allegation of my client, Brother Khan Suri, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  being bad for the foreign policy of the United States. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=250.4s)]
*  And the law also mandates that if such a determination is made based on someone's speech, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=253.5s)]
*  that ordinarily would be constitutionally protected. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=263.3s)]
*  And that is this case, make no mistake. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=265.8s)]
*  There also is a requirement that if the Secretary of State wants to overturn [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=268.3s)]
*  or make that determination in spite of someone's speech, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=272.2s)]
*  that they have to notify the chairman of two congressional committees, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=276.2s)]
*  both on the House side and on the Senate side. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=280.9s)]
*  And to date, not only have we not gotten a determination, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=283.2s)]
*  but there's been no evidence, no indication, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=285.9s)]
*  that Marco Rubio went and notified the proper congressional committees [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=288.3s)]
*  the way he was supposed to under the text of the law itself. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=291.9s)]
*  So I want to come back to that 1952 law and Rubio in a moment, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=295.2s)]
*  but just on your client, what is it about Brother Khan Suri, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=297.9s)]
*  an Indian-born immigrant, that put him, do you think, on the Trump administration's radar? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=301.0s)]
*  Because according to some of his colleagues at Georgetown, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=305.5s)]
*  he was not a very outwardly political person. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=308.09999999999997s)]
*  He wasn't Mahmood Khalil. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=310.0s)]
*  He wasn't negotiating with the university on behalf of an encampment. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=311.1s)]
*  Liking this video? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=313.90000000000003s)]
*  Then don't just watch. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  Hit like, share and subscribe. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  And tap the bell so you never miss a video or live show. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=318.1s)]
*  But if you want early access to exclusive content, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  then you have to head to Zateo.com and subscribe now. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=323.90000000000003s)]
*  You'll be supporting fearless independent journalism. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=327.5s)]
*  You know, that's what makes this all the more concerning [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=330.40000000000003s)]
*  is because this is absolutely a guilt by association. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  The association being his father-in-law, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  who is a former advisor to Hamas. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=340.1s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=342.70000000000005s)]
*  A person that, according to the information that we have, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  he has met twice in his entire life, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=347.20000000000005s)]
*  doesn't really know, and has not had any sort of meaningful relationship with. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=350.70000000000005s)]
*  One of those times when he asked for his daughter's hand in marriage, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  and otherwise has no relationship with. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=358.5s)]
*  So it's guilt by association? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=362.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=363.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=365.3s)]
*  And is it true that Bother and his wife [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=366.3s)]
*  had been targeted by right-wing groups on campus before this arrest and detention? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=369.5s)]
*  Do you believe that right-wing groups [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=374.5s)]
*  are feeding the names of people on college campuses [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=376.5s)]
*  to the Trump administration to have picked up by masked agents? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=379.0s)]
*  They have certainly taken credit for it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=383.0s)]
*  The Middle East Forum, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=386.3s)]
*  Anne Stanley, I believe is her name, and the Cameron, Canary, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=388.0s)]
*  all these groups that have been... [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=391.40000000000003s)]
*  Beta. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=394.2s)]
*  Bearing, Beta is another one, right, Beitar. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  Smearing and doxing people, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=399.8s)]
*  putting names, and they just found a willing ear in this administration. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=402.2s)]
*  You mentioned the kind of judge shopping that they do by going to Louisiana and Texas. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=408.59999999999997s)]
*  Last week, a federal judge in Virginia ordered immigration officials, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  I believe, to not deport Bother Khan Suri. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=417.8s)]
*  Do you have any confidence that will actually stop the Trump administration [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=421.5s)]
*  from doing so given they ignored a judge who said, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=424.8s)]
*  don't send alleged gang members to El Salvador? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  They just ignored that. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=430.7s)]
*  You know, the way the law is supposed to work, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=432.8s)]
*  he now has a hearing in immigration court scheduled for May. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  And so the way the law is supposed to work, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=441.3s)]
*  they're not supposed to deport him because there's no order of removal yet. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=443.2s)]
*  There's no order of removal. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  A judge has to make that determination. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=447.0s)]
*  Bother Khan also has the additional protection of a stay granted by a federal judge [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=448.8s)]
*  saying don't deport him until these issues are resolved. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=454.4s)]
*  So he actually has a double layer of protection. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=459.29999999999995s)]
*  And I'm still concerned. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=462.0s)]
*  I mean, our opposing counsel have assured us that he's not going to be removed. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=463.0s)]
*  And officers that I've spoken to on the Bother Khan Suri case have also assured me [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=469.29999999999995s)]
*  that he's not going to be removed. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=473.4s)]
*  And I guess I'm at the place where the fact that you even have to assure me is kind of sad. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=475.5s)]
*  Although this administration deported a Brown University professor to Lebanon [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=482.4s)]
*  despite her having a court order blocking her expulsion, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=485.7s)]
*  but they sent her to Beirut anyways. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=489.09999999999997s)]
*  Just on the law itself, because you mentioned, just explain to us, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=491.79999999999995s)]
*  because you mentioned that he still gets a day in court. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=495.0s)]
*  Is that something that the Rubio power, this whole 1952 clause about the Secretary of State [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=497.9s)]
*  having the power to personally remove someone who they believe will have adverse, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=503.7s)]
*  serious effects on US foreign policy? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=507.7s)]
*  Does Rubio get to trump that court? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=510.6s)]
*  So Rubio is actually the one to make that determination. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=516.3000000000001s)]
*  And the idea here is that, or the danger here is that no court has a meaningful enough power [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=519.6s)]
*  to review his determination. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=529.5s)]
*  My biggest fear is that Rubio could essentially chat GPT some reason as to why, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=531.9s)]
*  why somebody is bad for the foreign policy of the United States. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=538.7s)]
*  And a court, any court that tries to look at it will say, well, hey, that's what he said. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=543.0s)]
*  And shut off the blinders, shut off the judicial spotlight. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=547.8000000000001s)]
*  That's what needs to change. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=551.3000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the 1952 statute was declared unconstitutional by none other than Donald Trump's late sister, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=553.1s)]
*  Marianne Trump Barry, who passed away a few years ago. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=558.1s)]
*  But of course, it's never been tested by the Supreme Court. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=562.7s)]
*  We will see what happens. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  How worried are you as a lawyer in this country to see people's speech being used against them? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=567.4s)]
*  Because this idea that foreigners don't have First Amendment protections is a bit absurd. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=573.6s)]
*  It is absurd because it's not true and it's never been true. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=580.4s)]
*  And the reason why I think these cases are so significant, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=584.4s)]
*  both for Mahmoud Khalil and Mohamed Houtal and my client, Brother Khan Sury, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=588.4s)]
*  and the list is growing, unfortunately, is because it affects what we consider to be something very innately American, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=593.2s)]
*  our freedom of speech and the government weaponizing the immigration process to clamp down on dissent. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=600.3s)]
*  And make no mistake, we're not talking about, you know, the pre-existing exceptions to free speech [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=609.5s)]
*  where inciting hatred, etc., etc. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=617.3s)]
*  We are talking about constitutionally protected political speech. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=619.7s)]
*  We're talking about speech that has historically enjoyed the greatest level, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=623.5s)]
*  the strongest level of protection from the First Amendment. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=628.9s)]
*  And that is what this administration has seen fit to attack and that should concern every single American. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=631.4s)]
*  And a lot of immigrants on student visas, H-1Bs, even green cards, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=637.5s)]
*  are now worried about leaving the US, going abroad for a work trip or vacation [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=643.6s)]
*  because they're worried about what will happen when they come back in. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=646.9s)]
*  And you're an immigration lawyer, you must be getting inundated with people saying, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=649.1s)]
*  can I travel abroad right now? Should I just stay put in the US? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=651.5s)]
*  Every day, multiple times a day, and everybody is. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=655.0s)]
*  And oftentimes, the best advice that we give people is that it's going to depend on your particular situation. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=657.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, what we have to add to the mix in addition to somebody's immigration history [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=663.7s)]
*  is their history of political speech now. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=668.5s)]
*  And their social media content. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=672.1s)]
*  Yes, that is now a consideration in the advice that we give our clients [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=674.2s)]
*  on whether or not they should take the risk of traveling or not. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=679.4000000000001s)]
*  Last question, Hasan. If they can do this to non-citizens, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=682.2s)]
*  does that mean that inevitably they will do this to citizens as well, especially naturalized citizens? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=685.0s)]
*  I think they're going to try. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=690.0s)]
*  There's nothing to stop them from trying. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=692.1s)]
*  And naturalized citizens, as you know, can go through a process of denaturalization. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=694.6s)]
*  And there are statutes on the books that are seldom used, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=699.6s)]
*  but you know, the ammo of this administration seems to be use the laws that are never used [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=703.4s)]
*  and start using them in new ways and en masse. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=709.8s)]
*  So, you know, this is a very scary slope that we're on. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=713.0s)]
*  Hasan Ahmed, we will have to leave it there. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=718.9s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=720.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Matthew. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=722.6s)]
*  www.faiodot.com. Your support matters. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mb3k2PRaXE&t=733.4s)]
