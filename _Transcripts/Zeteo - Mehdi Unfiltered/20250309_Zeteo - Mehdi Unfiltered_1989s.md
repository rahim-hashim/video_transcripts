Video Description: Joe Walsh joins Mehdi Hasan in a HEATED debate over Israel and Gaza. Walsh, ex-Republican congressman turned Never-Trumper, is a proud supporter of Israel and its brutal war on Gaza.

Mehdi challenged Walsh on his use of the “G-word” on Russia and Ukraine but not Israel and Gaza; on his criticism of the International Criminal Court for having an “anti-Israel bias”; and on his refusal to condemn Israel’s displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank. Walsh pushed back – accusing Mehdi of making this issue sound like a “one-sided affair.”

Watch the full interview — it was a fiery affair, profanities were uttered, and, at one point, the former congressman even grabbed Mehdi’s questions paper out of his hand! Nevertheless, at Zeteo, we believe it is important for interviewers to ask tough questions – and even tougher follow-ups.

This video is PART TWO of Mehdi’s interview with Walsh. In Part One, they discuss the threat to American democracy from Trump, Musk, and MAGA. It is much less heated and sees Mehdi and Walsh in a great deal of agreement. Watch it here: https://zeteo.com/p/trump-maga-civil-war-violence-congress

# Mehdi DEBATES Pro-Israel Ex-Congressman
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro)
*  I don't support Hamas. Do you support Hamas? No. I don't support Israel. Do you support Israel? Yes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=0.0s)]
*  So that's what we're going to talk about. If Israel wanted to exterminate the Palestinian people, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=4.4s)]
*  they could have done it. That's the worst argument you've ever made it all the time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=10.4s)]
*  I tell you what, Vladimir Putin could have erased everyone in Ukraine with a new Duke. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=14.0s)]
*  No. It's not Israel's policy to target civilians. Israel has gone out of their way not to. 335 [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=18.16s)]
*  bullets fired into a car with children. Is that a war crime? I don't know. You know what? Could be. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=27.12s)]
*  Investigate it. But god damn it. This is what Hamas does all the time. They're starving people [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=30.96s)]
*  in Gaza. Are they starving people in Gaza? What would you? Answer me something. No. No. No. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=38.0s)]
*  No. They're not starving people in Gaza. So Cindy McCain. Yes, there's starvation in Gaza. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=43.28s)]
*  But gosh darn it, Israel has gone out of their way to allow aid in. 200 kids killed in the West [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=48.0s)]
*  Bank since October 7th. Are you okay with that? No. I'm not okay. Do you condemn Israel for [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=54.48s)]
*  killing 200 children in the West Bank? I'd have to know. You'd have to know how the children [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=59.76s)]
*  were killed? Yes. I'd have to know how the children were killed. Who's responsible for the children? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=63.76s)]
*  The Israelis are. There's no peace in that region. Why? Is it completely one sided? Because of Benjamin [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=67.92s)]
*  Netanyahu. That's why. No, hold on. No, it's not. I'll read it a third time. No, no. That's all it would [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=73.28s)]
*  be. Don't read it a third time. Let me answer the freaking question. You may have watched part one [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=77.76s)]
*  of my interview with former Republican Congressman Joe Walsh where we discussed Magher and Donald [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=84.64s)]
*  Trump and Elon Musk. But coming up is part two and it's the kind of interview I haven't done for a [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=89.84s)]
*  very long time. It got very, very heated. We debated Israel, Gaza, war crimes, genocide and more. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  You're going to want to watch this. Roll the tape. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=104.56s)]
*  You have been an outspoken opponent of Russia's invasion of Ukraine going as far as to call it a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  genocide. But when it comes to Gaza, you've criticized people for calling Gaza a genocide. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=117.28s)]
*  Why is that, Joe? Why is what's happening in Ukraine a genocide but not what's happening in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=123.2s)]
*  Gaza when far more people have been killed and displaced in Gaza than in Ukraine? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=128.88s)]
*  I think it goes to motive and intent. I think Putin is trying to kill, and he has been for three [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=132.96s)]
*  years, Ukrainian civilians, kidnapping Ukrainian children. His intent is to kill civilians. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=137.44s)]
*  You and I can arm wrestle. I don't think that's Israel's intent at all. I think Israel... Even [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=146.4s)]
*  though Israeli government members have said far more genocidal stuff than Vladimir Putin has. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=151.44s)]
*  Completely. There are extreme members of Israeli government. Not just extreme members. The [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=155.68s)]
*  president, the prime minister. There always have been. The president and prime minister of [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=160.32s)]
*  the country have said stuff that Vladimir Putin has not said about Ukraine, and yet Joe Walsh... [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=164.48s)]
*  If you said, neither is a genocide, then I'd be fine. We'll move on. We'll talk about other [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=169.92s)]
*  things about Gaza. What I find fascinating is that you're happy to say genocide here, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  but if you say it there, you get mad. I don't get it. I don't get mad. I just think... You do. I've [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  seen some of your tweets. I just think Putin's intent is to eliminate the Ukrainian people. Based [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=181.6s)]
*  on what? His words? Based on his actions. Why is Israel's words and actions not the same? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=188.32s)]
*  Israel's actions and words. Again, you can find some, but Israel's actions... Some? I could read [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=194.64s)]
*  you does that all day if I started reading out all the genocidal statements from Israeli men. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=201.04s)]
*  I can find you a more history of actions of not. Just a few days ago, the deputy speaker of the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=204.95999999999998s)]
*  Israeli parliament and senior member of the Likud party, Netanyahu's party, said that the Palestinian [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=210.88s)]
*  civilians, his words, civilians, are scum, subhuman, and the women and children should be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=215.44s)]
*  separated so that men can all be killed. That is stuff that Milosevic said. That is stuff I've not [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=221.2s)]
*  even heard Putin say. I don't hear Joe Walsh condemning that as genocide. Well, I would condemn [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  that, and I will condemn that statement. That's a genocidal statement. That is a genocidal statement. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=230.72s)]
*  I'm saying, Mehdi, that is a very minority view overall in Israel. Oh my God. In Israel's government [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=235.44s)]
*  and among the Israeli people. Well, put the Israeli people to one side. There's many polls. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=242.96s)]
*  The Israeli government consists of Netanyahu and Smotrich and Amir El Yahou who said, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=246.16s)]
*  let's drop a nuke on Gaza. That's not the majority. That is the Israeli government, Joe. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  They're the people killing the Palestinians right now, creating the post-war plan to wipe out the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=256.24s)]
*  Palestinians with Trump to get rid of them from the place. Is it genocidal? Is it Israel's intent [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=260.56s)]
*  to kill, to target and kill Palestinian civilians? 100 percent, yes. You believe it has. That's been [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=266.16s)]
*  their intent from day one after October 7th. They said it, Joe. I just quoted to you. The [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=271.2s)]
*  deputy speaker of parliament said, let's kill all the adult men in Gaza. So you're just putting your [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=276.88s)]
*  hands in your ears. No, no, no. I'm telling you that's a minority view. That's not the majority. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=280.8s)]
*  Okay, Benjamin Netanyahu said they are amelek. What is amelek, Joe? In the Bible, amelek is kill [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=283.92s)]
*  everybody. Men, women, children, even the donkeys. That's what Netanyahu said. I didn't hear Putin say [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=289.44s)]
*  that. Mehdi, again, I can find extreme things that members of Israel's government has said. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=294.08s)]
*  That counts as intent. And that's why they're at the ICJ and that's why ICJ is investigating him. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  That's why some of Israel's leading Holocaust scholars have said it's a genocide. If Israel [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=304.40000000000003s)]
*  wanted to exterminate the Palestinian people, they could have done it in three months. That's the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=308.88s)]
*  worst argument you've ever made in all the time I've ever had. Correct. I'll tell you why. Vladimir [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=314.08s)]
*  Putin could have erased everyone in Ukraine with a nuke. No. Yes, he could. Oh, God, no. Well, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=317.12s)]
*  with a nuke. Yeah. But with a nuke, then... No, hold on. Your argument is Israel is not genocidal [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  because they haven't killed everyone in Gaza and they could. I'm saying Vladimir Putin could [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=327.84s)]
*  kill everyone in Ukraine and he hasn't. Therefore, according to Joe Walsh's logic, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=330.96s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is not genocidal. A different situation in this degree. Israel is capable, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  from day one they were capable... As is Putin. Oh, oh, God. Well, only with nukes. Israel is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=340.32s)]
*  fighting another sovereign nation with a full-on military with the support of the world community. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  Ukraine. You meant Russia. You said Israel. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So Russia [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=351.91999999999996s)]
*  literally has an opposing army. Support it that... But it could wipe it out. And by the way, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=357.12s)]
*  the definition of genocide is not to kill everyone in a place. You know this, right? I do. They don't [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  have to kill everyone to be genocidal. Oh, I know that. But many... But what they've done meets many [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=365.44s)]
*  of the criteria of genocide, which is why they're in front of the ICJ, which is why some of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=369.52s)]
*  leading genocide scholars in the world are saying it's a genocide. No. Omar Bartov, Israeli Holocaust [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=373.44s)]
*  historian. Amos Goldberg, Israeli Holocaust historian. Daniel Blatvich, Israeli Holocaust... [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=378.96s)]
*  They all say it's genocide. Are they crazy? These people study this for a living, Joe. But do you... [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=383.76s)]
*  Not you and me. No, I know that. I know that. And I respect those opinions. But I don't think [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=387.44s)]
*  that's the majority view. But secondly, the only... Going back to Russia... Amnesty International, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=391.04s)]
*  Human Rights Watch. All say genocide. Well, again... Human rights groups, Israeli Holocaust [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  historians. Joe Walsh. With respect. What do you know that they don't know? With respect. I'm sure [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=402.4s)]
*  it's more than Joe Walsh. But again, just to get back to Russia on this point, Mehdi, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=407.92s)]
*  so Russia would be forced to use a nuke because Russia is fighting literally an army... But they [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=412.72s)]
*  could, is what I'm saying. People were worried about Putin using nuke. Right, right. But a nuke then [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=418.32s)]
*  would mean the destruction of Russia. That's a whole different equation. Israel doesn't have to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=423.44s)]
*  use a nuke, and they didn't from day one, to get rid of the Palestinian people. But they have made [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=429.04s)]
*  life uninhabitable. It's not hypothetical. As of right now, Gaza is uninhabitable. Donald Trump [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=433.84s)]
*  says so. The President of the United States. In fact, let me show you. I think we've got some [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=438.4s)]
*  footage. I'd love to get your response to this footage. Because Gaza, over the last 16 months, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=440.88s)]
*  have a look at the screen, has suffered an apocalyptic level of destruction. This is a [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=444.64s)]
*  recent drone video from January. 70% of the buildings destroyed. Look at that imagery. That [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=448.32s)]
*  is not an anti-terror operation. That is not just targeting Hamas. That is... Look at the imagery. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=452.71999999999997s)]
*  That is something out of... I don't even know what... Is that Mad Max movie? It's entirety [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=457.52s)]
*  destruction. If that's not genocidal, I don't know what is. I haven't seen scenes like that [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=462.0s)]
*  in Ukraine. Maybe in one town, Mariupol. But I haven't seen the entire Gaza Strip. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=465.6s)]
*  Medi, by every measurement of urban warfare, Israel has gone... Please don't give me a talking [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=469.84s)]
*  point, Joe. No, I'm not. I'm looking at that. I'm responding to the footage. You don't give a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=475.36s)]
*  damn about the footage. That doesn't bother you. No, I don't say that. I do give a damn. Well, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=479.6s)]
*  then engage with it. I do give a damn. Please don't give me some talking point about [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=481.92s)]
*  urban warfare stats. No, no. It is... I know the stats. I can give you stats. I'm asking you to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=484.32s)]
*  respond to that footage. It is a... Agreed. And... Entire cities and towns wiped out. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=487.68s)]
*  Agreed. Gaza needs to be rebuilt, no doubt. That's not engaging with the footage. No, it is. What [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=491.36s)]
*  is your human reaction to seeing entire town, cities, refugee camps wiped out? My reaction is [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=495.04s)]
*  that really sucks. That's horrible. That needs to be rebuilt. But I'm not going to lay the lion's [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=501.84000000000003s)]
*  share of the blame on Israel for that. The people who wiped that out. The people who chose to drop [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  2,000 pound bombs on civilian homes, apartments, buildings. I'm going to lay the lion's share of [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=511.92s)]
*  the blame on Hamas for starting the war on October 7th, knowing exactly what would happen, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=516.64s)]
*  hiding for years behind their civilians, putting their civilians in harm's way. I'm not going to [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=522.08s)]
*  blame the army. It's a very strange argument that says they started a war knowing that would happen. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=527.52s)]
*  Oh, God, yeah. So hold on. So if I start a fight with a known gangster or murderer and he kills a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=531.12s)]
*  bunch of my family and spots it, it's my fault? Oh. No, seriously. The law... It's a very strange [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=536.56s)]
*  argument. You're basically conceding that Israel was going to respond in a genocidal way. That's [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=540.64s)]
*  what you're saying. You're saying Hamas started knowing Israel would do that. That doesn't make [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=544.0s)]
*  it morally right what Israel did. I'm not conceding that's a genocidal way. What is that? What is that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=547.36s)]
*  imagery in your eyes? I'm trying to understand what is that imagery. No, that is a horrible [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=551.6s)]
*  result. That is something we've not seen in modern wars. I mean, what they've done in Gaza, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=557.28s)]
*  America, other military commanders, you know this, Joey, killing the US, have said, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=561.36s)]
*  we would never do this. But many... The UK, the US. The Gaza is a very unusual setting for a war [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=564.72s)]
*  like this. I'll give you this. But we're talking about Hamas that has a history of purposely [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=571.92s)]
*  provoking Israel, then hiding behind... That's your plan. They would say they're provoked by Israel by [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=579.92s)]
*  unending occupation. But I want to ask you this question about civilians. I do want to ask you [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=584.64s)]
*  because... I love being with you. No, but I want to ask you because I want to deal with actual [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  substantive stuff. We can all... But that is substantive stuff. No, it's opinion. I want to [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=591.68s)]
*  deal with fact. Oh my God. It is opinion about who provoked who. We can get into that. We'll come to [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=594.7199999999999s)]
*  that. I promise. But just dealing with this, I just want to deal with human... Because the reason [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=598.96s)]
*  I want to talk to you about the subject is because at home in the US, I see you caring about human [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=602.0s)]
*  rights, civil liberties, democracy, fascism. And then I see Israel, you're on the wrong side [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=607.2s)]
*  completely. So when I look at, for example, that destruction, I don't think you would defend that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=612.08s)]
*  if it wasn't Israel that was doing it. Similarly, six-year-old Hind Rajab, you always say Hamas, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=616.0s)]
*  Hamas, Hamas. This is the great excuse for Israel committing war crimes. You have a six-year-old girl, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=619.9200000000001s)]
*  Hind Rajab, infamously killed in a car with her four cousins, her uncle and aunt, all killed by an [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=624.8s)]
*  Israeli tank that was firing at them. She makes a 911 call, very, very tragic, horrific call. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=630.8s)]
*  They send two paramedics, the Palestinians, to rescue her. The Israelis kill the paramedics as [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=636.64s)]
*  well in the ambulance. Sky News, the Washington Post have all debunked the Israeli denials that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=640.9599999999999s)]
*  their tank wasn't in the area at the time. The UK independent investigators, Forensic Architecture, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=646.0799999999999s)]
*  they looked at it and said that the Israelis fired 335 bullets into this car and that the tank [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=651.2s)]
*  driver had to have seen that there were children sitting in this car. How do you defend that, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=656.64s)]
*  Joe? I don't. I don't. You do. I've got a quote from you that says, Israel deserves immense praise [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=660.48s)]
*  for winning this war as carefully as they can. Would you say that to the remaining family members? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=664.96s)]
*  No, no, no, let me finish. Would you say that to their faces of Hind Rajab's family? Oh, God, no. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=668.72s)]
*  Mehdi, look, I defend the way Israel, let me finish. In abstract, that's why I get specific. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=672.96s)]
*  I know how people do this. No, no, no. Specific. So let me address both. I agree. Broadly speaking, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=678.9599999999999s)]
*  I defend the way Israel has fought this war, acknowledging that, and let me finish this thought, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  that mistakes are made in every war and that there are purposeful, indefensible acts made even by the [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  IDF and any military. And that's an example of one. So you're agreeing then that in this war that you [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=699.76s)]
*  support, Israel has committed war crimes? Oh, I agree. Purposeful, yes, mistakes have been made. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=706.0s)]
*  No, not mistakes. Mistake is I shot that person. I didn't mean to shoot that person. War crime is I [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=713.36s)]
*  deliberately killed a civilian, which you seemed to concede for a moment, then you pulled back. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=718.32s)]
*  No, no, hold on. I don't know that I'm going to call it a war crime. I'm going to say, oh, I don't [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=721.2s)]
*  know. Why? It's killing a child with 335 bullets in a war crime. Give me the formal definition of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=724.48s)]
*  war crime. A violation of international humanitarian or deliberately targeting civilians. What every [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=728.96s)]
*  human rights group, I mean, I could start reading to you. I could read to you from the International [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=732.64s)]
*  Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor's Envoy. So yes. We know he's literally charged. So many. The Prime [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  Minister you support with war crimes. Well. And crimes against humanity. I don't support that Prime [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=741.4399999999999s)]
*  Minister. You've praised him. You've praised him. I also called for him to resign. I know, but you've [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=746.4s)]
*  also praised him. Hold on. You've also praised him. Right, right, right, but let me get that on the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=750.0s)]
*  record. So I'm factually accurate when I say you've praised him. Two weeks after October 7th, I said he [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=753.6s)]
*  needs to go. And then in the 18 months since you've praised a man who's indicted. I've also been [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=756.24s)]
*  critical of him as well. Indicted for war crimes. I could care less about what the IJC said about [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=759.84s)]
*  war crimes. You sound like a Republican of old now. No, no, no. You do. Republicans, this is what I'm [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=765.12s)]
*  saying. You're like, rule of law, judiciary, court, abroad, screw the ICJ and the ICC. Do you see how [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  you switch from home and abroad? At home, you're Joe Walsh the Democrat. Still a shame. Abroad, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=776.96s)]
*  you're Joe Walsh supporter of fascism and anti-international law. But you know what's great about this whole [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=781.52s)]
*  thing is it's all focused on Israel. You haven't for a second talked about what is. Why would I? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=787.12s)]
*  You're not a supporter of the Palestinians or Hamas. When I talk to people who support that, I ask them [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=793.6s)]
*  about that. You are a supporter of the Israeli government. So I'm going to ask you about Israel. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=797.2s)]
*  And I'm going to. And you can do what about is all you want. Again, that's what MAGA people do here. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=800.88s)]
*  When you ask them about MAGA, what do they do? They blame the Democrats. So let's not play that game. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=804.88s)]
*  No, I'm not. Let's ask you about Israel. Mehdi, it's not the MAGA game. I'm going to say yes. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=808.32s)]
*  Israel's made mistakes. I'm going to say yes. Israel, Israel, call what you want. Israel. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=812.56s)]
*  No, no, I'm asking you to call it. And I'm going to tell you. I don't know. I'm going to tell you. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=818.16s)]
*  No, no, no, no, Joe. I'm not going to let you run away with it. You can shout what you want. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=821.68s)]
*  335 bullets fired into a car with children. Is that a war crime? I don't know. You know what? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=824.4s)]
*  Could be investigated. But God damn it. It was investigated, Joe. This is what Hamas does all [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=828.56s)]
*  the time. Hiding behind civilians is a war crime. You know what slays me about you? By the way, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=834.56s)]
*  I see you say this all the time. Hiding behind civilians, hiding behind civilians. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=840.8s)]
*  And yet when Israelis actually use Palestinians as human shields, you don't say anything. Last week, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=844.64s)]
*  it emerged. I checked your Twitter, Joe. You can correct me. Last week, it emerged that an 80-year-old [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=849.04s)]
*  man, Israeli press reported, was being used as a human shield. They were taking him into houses, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=853.52s)]
*  putting him in front of them. An actual human shield. They were using a Palestinian man. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=857.52s)]
*  They've done that many times. They've done that many times. They've sent Palestinians into tunnels [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=861.52s)]
*  in Gaza. Have you condemned that as a use of human shields? I was not aware of it. If I was [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=866.0s)]
*  aware of it, I'd condemn it. Why are you not acknowledging that this is Hamas' policy? And [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=872.08s)]
*  this has been their policy from day one. What I acknowledge about Hamas is irrelevant because [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=878.88s)]
*  let me hear you say it. I don't support Hamas. Do you support Hamas? No. Do you support Hamas? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=883.52s)]
*  No. Do you support Hamas? No. I don't support Hamas. So that's done. Stop for a minute. It's [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=887.76s)]
*  not done. No. No, not when you don't let me finish sentences. Joe, let me finish my [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=892.56s)]
*  sentences. Bullshit, Marty. I'll give you a long answer if you let me finish this one sentence. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=897.52s)]
*  I don't support Hamas. Do you support Hamas? No. I don't support Israel. Do you support Israel? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=902.2399999999999s)]
*  Yes. So that's what we're going to talk about. Stop. No, no, no. It's very simple. You're here [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=906.3199999999999s)]
*  to support Israel. No, but stop. Why are we talking about something we both disagree with? Hamas has [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=910.0799999999999s)]
*  been the governing entity in Gaza for how many years? So yes, you do need to talk about Hamas [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=913.52s)]
*  because Hamas did what they did on October 7th. And we've condemned it. Hamas has said yes. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=920.08s)]
*  Do you condemn? Yes. Do you condemn? But you're not condemning Israeli war crimes. That's what I [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=924.48s)]
*  don't understand. You're trying to dodge it with what about is about Hamas. It's a very simple [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  question. I can keep going. Let's play a clip here. Let's play a clip for you to watch. We got a clip [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=931.76s)]
*  of a grandmother. Here's a grandmother. Maybe you're not aware of this one. This is a Palestinian [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=935.36s)]
*  grandmother in her 50s. She's holding a child, right, in her arm. He's got a white flag. She's [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=939.2s)]
*  shot in cold blood by an Israeli snubber. Marty, I don't know what the hell that was. That's not... [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  How do I know? It's a sniper who shot a Palestinian grandmother. How, Mehdi, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=948.4s)]
*  you invite me on, you show me a clip of that, and you tell me what it is. I'm sorry. Okay, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=952.72s)]
*  I'm not familiar with that. Okay. I'd like to know what that is. I'm not familiar with that. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=957.92s)]
*  You know I can go through multiple examples, right? You know that. I can start reading [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=961.76s)]
*  multiple examples. The Aldos family in Gaza whose apartment building was bombed. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=965.04s)]
*  We can go through each stop. But where you and I will disagree is this. And I'm telling you, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=969.1999999999999s)]
*  this is ugly and it's horrible and it's unfortunate. It's war crimes. It's not [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=974.48s)]
*  Israel's policy to target civilians. Israel has gone out of their way not to. They are fighting [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=978.64s)]
*  an opposition, Mehdi, that has a history of doing the exact opposite. You say they don't have a [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=986.48s)]
*  policy of doing that. And see, you won't acknowledge that. You won't... Can you just... Can you say yes [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  or no to that? What, yes or no to? Does Hamas have a history of doing the exact opposite? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=997.9200000000001s)]
*  Does Hamas... Does Hamas... Does Hamas... Hold on. ... target Israeli civilians? Hamas has... Yes, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1003.92s)]
*  it has in the past. For example, when I was a teenager, I was condemning bus bombings, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1008.56s)]
*  if you remember, in the 90s, right? But hold on, hold on, hold on. As a policy, though, Mehdi... [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1012.16s)]
*  This is pure whataboutism, Joe. No, it's not. It is. As a policy. That's the policy of Hamas. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1016.16s)]
*  The governing entity of Gaza. I'm the only one here who has condemned civilian killings on [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1022.8s)]
*  both sides. You've called it a mistake, which I find grotesque. Let me read to you about [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1028.1599999999999s)]
*  Israeli policy. This is from Haaretz, last year, Israeli newspaper. You're saying you're not aware [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1031.76s)]
*  of this. Let me tell you this. An Israeli soldier relays that a senior commander asked him to shoot [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1035.6s)]
*  an unarmed man with a white flag. He said he's got a white flag. He says, I don't care. Shoot him. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1040.4s)]
*  It's an order. Another Israeli soldier told Plus 972, there were no restrictions on ammunition. We [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1044.32s)]
*  could just shoot to relieve our boredom. We don't need to explain. You just shoot. When soldiers see [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1048.96s)]
*  someone approaching, it's permissible to shoot them. We can shoot a young girl, an old woman. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1053.36s)]
*  This is testimony from Israeli soldiers, Joe, that it's a free fire zone. They can shoot and [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1057.44s)]
*  kill whoever they want. That is a policy. That is a war crime. And many would argue that's genocide. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1061.6000000000001s)]
*  That is what you're defending today, which is kind of sad. Do you believe? Answer this question. No, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1065.76s)]
*  no, no. I'm saying I condemn that. Finally. Hold on. Maybe you just say condemn it. Why won't you call [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1071.68s)]
*  it a war crime? I'll say Hamas did on October 7th was a war crime. Will you say what I've described [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1078.88s)]
*  a war crime? Here's what I won't give to you. Hold on. Maybe a war crime. I don't trust some [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1082.8s)]
*  international group who has... You don't trust Palestinians who talk about being raped and tortured in [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1088.56s)]
*  Camp David? Hold on. I don't trust an international group with an inherent anti-Israel bias to tell me [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1092.32s)]
*  that's a war crime. Is the International Criminal Court anti-Israel bias? Oh, God, yeah. Like the UN has. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1096.96s)]
*  What's the evidence? No, no. I'm not... You just made a claim. This is very Trumpy right now, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1101.84s)]
*  just throwing things around. What is the ICC's evidence of anti-Semitism? Do me a favor. Just one... [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1104.96s)]
*  Do me one favor. Don't call it Trumpian. Don't call it... Because it's so fascinating to see [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1109.6s)]
*  that you are borrowing... I think the United Nations has an anti-Israel bias to you. That's a different... [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1114.8799999999999s)]
*  And also, I said the ICC... Hold on. Where's the ICC's anti-Israel bias? That's not Trumpian. I don't want to debate that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1119.12s)]
*  right now. I'm asking... Because it's a long debate. This is a very simple one. Where's your evidence of [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1123.52s)]
*  ICC anti-Israel bias? Most of the people they've indicted are African leaders. They haven't indicted [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1127.36s)]
*  anyone from Israel ever. Israel's not... They also indicted Hamas commanders. Because I do not believe [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1131.52s)]
*  Israel's committing a genocide. And I think they were out of line saying that Israel's... ICC never said [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1136.48s)]
*  they're committing a genocide. What did ICC say? International Criminal Court said he's guilty. They [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1141.28s)]
*  charged him... With war crimes. With willful killing of civilians and starvation. Charged who? Right? And guess [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1145.52s)]
*  who backed them up? Charged who? Guess who was their advisor? Charged who? Theodore Myron. Charged who? Holocaust survivor. Charged who? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1150.24s)]
*  Israeli judge. Is he anti-Israel as well? Charged who? Netanyahu? You think... Netanyahu and Gallant? You think [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1154.8s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and Gallant have purposely tried to destroy, kill and starve... That is what the evidence [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1160.48s)]
*  says. The ICC have amassed. That's what the ICC has amassed. And your argument is, instead of engaging with the evidence, like the evidence I've given you... [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1166.0s)]
*  No, you know what you've done... Is to say that... Hold on, let me finish that. Anti-Israel bias. That's just Trumpian. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1171.52s)]
*  No, no, no. You're not engaging in the facts. Because you know what you've done. You know what you've done again. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1175.68s)]
*  You're not the ICC. I'm not. You know what you've done. This is what you do. I love you. You're great. But you [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1179.2s)]
*  you will grab example after example and you'll tell me... Facts. That... Factual instances and you'll tell me [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1183.76s)]
*  this is proof that this is Israel's policy. And I'm telling you... I literally just read out to you what Sol just says is Israel's policy. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1190.24s)]
*  I'm telling you, Israel's policy is not to target and wipe out and destroy the Palestinian people. And the difference between me and you is you're just opining and I'm giving evidence. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1195.6s)]
*  How do you know it? You're giving me... I'm giving you an example. You're giving me examples. So far, since this interview began, I've read out to you what the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1203.6s)]
*  deputy speaker said which you condemned. I've read out to you about a kid being killed which you apparently... Let me finish. You keep interrupting me and saying I'm interrupting you. Oh, bullshit. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1210.72s)]
*  A kid being killed, you've condemned it. You're the king of the interruption. I've shown you a video of a grandmother being killed. You said you know anything about it. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1217.8400000000001s)]
*  I've read out quotes from Israeli soldiers and I've quoted the International Freaking Criminal Court. Tell me when you're done. And you said they're just anti-Israel. Tell me when you're done. That does sound Trumpy time. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1223.76s)]
*  Well, they are anti-Israel. Where's your evidence? I've condemned every... I'll stay here all day. Where's your evidence that the ICC is anti-Israel? Hold on. I'll condemn every example you've given me. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1231.76s)]
*  Where is the evidence ICC is anti-Israel? My evidence that they're not is the way that Israel has conducted this war. Period. Trying to move... By making Gaza uninhabitable, starving people. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1238.64s)]
*  Trying to move civilians out of the way. Leaflets to notify civilians to get out or get a body here. And killing tens of thousands of people. Going out of the way. Clearing hospitals. Do you... They destroyed most of the hospitals in Gaza. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1248.64s)]
*  Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

*  You just throw out anti-Israel. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1312.02s)]
*  Based on what? You've got no evidence. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1313.52s)]
*  Everyone's... I consider all day. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1315.52s)]
*  What's your evidence for the ICC against Israel? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1317.26s)]
*  Because I think they had it in for Netanyahu. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1318.76s)]
*  I think they had it in for Kalan. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1320.06s)]
*  Who cares what you think was his... [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1321.26s)]
*  What's your evidence? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1322.46s)]
*  When I look at... Again, I got to go back. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1323.6599999999999s)]
*  When I look at what was put forward... [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1326.3s)]
*  They've charged mostly African leaders, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1328.84s)]
*  and in this case, they've charged Hamas and Israel, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1330.54s)]
*  and your argument is, instead of engage [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1332.34s)]
*  with the copious evidence that the prosecutors brought, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1333.74s)]
*  that the judges have supported... [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1336.1399999999999s)]
*  Do you look at the way Israel... [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1337.24s)]
*  The evidence is there. You don't want to hear starvation. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1338.5s)]
*  You look at the way... [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1340.54s)]
*  They're starving people in Gaza. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1341.64s)]

*  I'll swim across the ocean to defend Israel. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1443.6399999999999s)]
*  You're very gung-ho in your support for Israel [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1445.26s)]
*  in a way that Israelis are not. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1446.84s)]
*  They're like, our country is messing up big time. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1448.1399999999999s)]
*  And then there's you. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1450.44s)]
*  I haven't heard you criticize so many things Israel are doing. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1451.48s)]
*  You are today because I've asked you to. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1454.52s)]
*  But I went through your Twitter thread. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1455.9s)]
*  I went through your Twitter, Joe. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1457.4s)]
*  Let me just ask you. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1458.4s)]
*  I just want to ask, just want to check your views. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1459.4s)]
*  So viewers know your views. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1461.4s)]
*  Generally, I don't. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1462.7s)]
*  You don't criticize Israel. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1463.7s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1464.7s)]
*  I will, but generally, I don't. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1465.7s)]
*  So for example, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1466.7s)]
*  40,000 Palestinians in the West Bank [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1467.7s)]
*  have been driven from their homes. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1469.7s)]
*  The Israelis said, you can't come back. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1470.7s)]
*  That's a war crime. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1472.2s)]
*  Do you condemn that? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1473.2s)]
*  Just in the last few weeks. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1474.2s)]
*  You criticize that. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1475.2s)]
*  What do you mean they've been driven from their homes? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1476.2s)]
*  They've been pushed out by the Israeli military. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1477.2s)]
*  40,000 people, the size of a town in your old district in Illinois, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1478.7s)]
*  just gone. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1481.7s)]
*  And they've been told you cannot come back. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1482.7s)]
*  Netanyahu's sitting in their house in a photo. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1484.2s)]
*  You would go mad if Vladimir Putin was sitting in a Ukrainian home. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1486.2s)]
*  Mehdi, I don't understand what... [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1490.2s)]
*  Pull back for a minute. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1497.2s)]
*  After October 7th, what would you have headed to Israel? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1498.2s)]
*  The West Bank has nothing to do with October 7th. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1500.2s)]
*  That's why I specifically asked about the West Bank. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1501.7s)]
*  Because I know you're obsessed with going back to October 7th [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1503.2s)]
*  and Hamas as the world began. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1505.2s)]
*  No, no, I'm sorry. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1506.2s)]
*  The West Bank. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1507.2s)]
*  Hamas does not run the West Bank. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1508.2s)]
*  I didn't know you were talking about the West Bank. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1509.2s)]
*  I'm talking about the West Bank. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1510.2s)]
*  40,000 people driven from their homes by violent settlers. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1511.7s)]
*  You've been watching the violent settlers, crazy people. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1513.7s)]
*  I assume you don't agree with them. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1515.7s)]
*  They make Marjorie Taylor Greene and Trump look moderate, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1516.7s)]
*  the far-right Israeli settlers. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1518.7s)]
*  They are as close as we've got to radical Islamist terrorists. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1519.7s)]
*  And they are driving people out of their homes. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1522.7s)]
*  40,000 people. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1524.7s)]
*  Do you condemn them? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1525.7s)]
*  I've not seen you say a word about that on your social media [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1526.7s)]
*  and your shows. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1527.7s)]
*  That's happening right now. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1528.7s)]
*  I don't hear you criticizing Israel for it. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1529.7s)]
*  I don't. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1530.7s)]
*  You don't criticize Israel for driving 40,000 people from their homes? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1531.7s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1534.7s)]
*  I don't. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1535.7s)]
*  Look, Israel has to... [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1536.7s)]
*  They're not going to make the same mistake they made in Gaza. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1540.2s)]
*  They're doing exactly what they did in Gaza, actually. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1542.2s)]
*  They're displacing people from their homes. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1545.2s)]
*  What do you mean they're doing what they did in Gaza? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1547.2s)]
*  Well, a million people have been driven from their homes in Gaza. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1548.2s)]
*  And now we have 50,000 people. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1550.2s)]
*  Because of what? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1551.2s)]
*  Because Israel is breaking international law. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1552.2s)]
*  Oh, not because the ruling governing entity of Gaza declared war on Israel on October 7. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1554.2s)]
*  Even if that were true. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1560.2s)]
*  And that's not true? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1561.2s)]
*  No, there was a war before October 7. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1562.2s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1563.2s)]
*  I know Joe Walsh's world began on October 7, but there's been an occupation since 1967. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1564.2s)]
*  No, no, I know that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1567.2s)]
*  Hamas didn't even exist in 1967. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1568.2s)]
*  So the war didn't begin on October 7. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1569.7s)]
*  But my question is, you're saying now today... [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1571.7s)]
*  OK, they initiated the latest stage of this war. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1573.7s)]
*  200 kids killed in the West Bank since October 7. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1576.7s)]
*  Are you OK with that? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1579.7s)]
*  No! [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1580.7s)]
*  Do you condemn Israel? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1581.7s)]
*  OK, do you condemn Israel for killing 200 children in the West Bank since October 7? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1582.7s)]
*  I'd have to know... [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1585.7s)]
*  You'd have to know how the children were killed? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1586.7s)]
*  Yes, I'd have to know how the children were killed, who's responsible for the children killed... [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1588.7s)]
*  The Israelis are. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1591.7s)]
*  The Israelis are. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1592.7s)]
*  The Israelis are. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1593.7s)]
*  Just like I'd want to know every Israeli... [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1594.7s)]
*  Every settler killed in the West Bank. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1596.7s)]
*  Look, Mehdi, this is... [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1599.2s)]
*  The 200 kids killed, and you don't... [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1600.2s)]
*  You can't bring yourself to condemn them. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1602.2s)]
*  No, I do condemn it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1603.2s)]
*  I want to know who... [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1604.2s)]
*  You did just a moment ago. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1605.2s)]
*  You literally did not a moment ago. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1606.2s)]
*  I don't know who killed those 200 kids. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1607.2s)]
*  Israel did, according to every intellectual observer. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1608.2s)]
*  OK, show me. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1610.2s)]
*  Show me. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1611.2s)]
*  Human rights. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1612.2s)]
*  The UN. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1613.2s)]
*  Show me. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1614.2s)]
*  Show me what? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1615.2s)]
*  Show me. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1616.2s)]
*  Show me every instant where the... [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1617.2s)]
*  And I'll show you a terrorist attack where six Israelis... [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1618.2s)]
*  No, that is not true. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1621.2s)]
*  There are no... [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1622.2s)]
*  Many of these cases involve children who are not here. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1623.2s)]
*  No, I'll show you a terrorist attack... [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1624.2s)]
*  There's a video from Channel 4 News. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1625.2s)]
*  ...where Israelis were killed. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1626.2s)]
*  You're just making stuff up now. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1627.7s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1628.7s)]
*  You are. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1629.7s)]
*  I said to you, many kids are killed [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1630.7s)]
*  and you just assume there's a terrorist attack. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1631.7s)]
*  Mehdi, you make this sound like a fucking one-sided affair forever. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1632.7s)]
*  I know the war's been going on forever. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1635.7s)]
*  Maybe that's telling. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1636.7s)]
*  Maybe that's telling. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1637.7s)]
*  But hold... [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1638.7s)]
*  What do you mean, maybe that's telling? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1639.7s)]
*  It is one-sided. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1640.7s)]
*  Stop. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1641.7s)]
*  One side is the occupier, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1642.7s)]
*  the other side is occupied. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1643.7s)]
*  One side has nuclear weapons [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1644.7s)]
*  and is killing thousands of children. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1645.7s)]
*  The other side has not killed thousands of Israeli children. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1646.7s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1648.7s)]
*  Answer this. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1649.7s)]
*  There's no peace in that region. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1650.7s)]
*  Why? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1651.7s)]
*  Is it completely one-sided? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1652.7s)]
*  Because of Benjamin Dutton, yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1653.7s)]
*  That's why. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1654.7s)]
*  No, no, those are his words, not mine. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1656.2s)]
*  Those are his words, not mine. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1657.2s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm asking... [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1658.2s)]
*  It's funny because you said recently... [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1659.2s)]
*  I'm not... [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1660.2s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm not asking. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1661.2s)]
*  I'm glad you brought this up. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1662.2s)]
*  You said there would be peace in the Middle East tomorrow [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1663.2s)]
*  if the Palestinians wanted peace [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1664.2s)]
*  and agreed Israel has a right to exist. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1665.2s)]
*  That's all it would take. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1667.2s)]
*  And that's all... [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1668.2s)]
*  It's on the Palestinians, you said. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1669.2s)]
*  Israel has always wanted peace. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1670.2s)]
*  Ehud Olmert came on my show. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1671.2s)]
*  He doesn't agree with you. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1672.2s)]
*  Ehud Barak doesn't agree. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1673.2s)]
*  There are Israeli politicians who say, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1674.2s)]
*  actually, no, Israeli government's a blocked peace. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1675.2s)]
*  Let me ask you something. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1676.2s)]
*  Netanyahu said recently, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1677.2s)]
*  No, let me answer... [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1678.7s)]
*  No, I'm going to answer it four times. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1679.7s)]
*  Let me answer... [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1680.7s)]
*  Ask her my question. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1681.7s)]
*  No, no, I'm not going to accept your answer. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1682.7s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu says I'm the guy who blocked peace, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1683.7s)]
*  blocked a Palestinian state for decades. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1685.7s)]
*  He's bragging about blocking peace. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1686.7s)]
*  And you're pretending that Israel is the block. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1687.7s)]
*  Hold on, I'm asking you. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1688.7s)]
*  I can read you the quote. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1689.7s)]
*  I'm asking you. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1690.7s)]
*  I want to make sure I heard you correct. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1691.7s)]
*  Go on. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1692.7s)]
*  There is not peace in that region. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1693.7s)]
*  Are you telling me that's all on Israel? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1694.7s)]
*  It's not all on Israel, but it's mostly on Israel. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1695.7s)]
*  It's mostly on Israel. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1696.7s)]
*  It's mostly on Israel. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1697.7s)]
*  It's mostly on Israel. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1698.7s)]
*  It's mostly on Israel. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1699.7s)]
*  It's mostly on Israel. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1700.7s)]
*  Going back 70, 80 years... [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1702.2s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1703.2s)]
*  If you want to get into 1948, we can do that. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1704.2s)]
*  There'll be another show. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1705.2s)]
*  We don't have time for that today. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1706.2s)]
*  But in terms of the last couple of decades of the quote-unquote peace process, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1707.2s)]
*  Netanyahu said his words, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1708.2s)]
*  Everyone knows that I am the one who for decades blocked the establishment of a Palestinian state. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1709.2s)]
*  He's saying it out loud. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1710.2s)]
*  And then you go on Twitter and say it's all the Palestinians' fault. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1711.2s)]
*  That's absurd. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1712.2s)]
*  It is, because Hamas, the Palestinian people, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1713.2s)]
*  they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1714.2s)]
*  They're going to be able to do it. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1715.2s)]
*  They're going to be able to do it. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1716.2s)]
*  They're going to be able to do it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1717.2s)]
*  They're going to be able to do it. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1718.2s)]
*  They're going to be able to do it. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1719.2s)]
*  That is true. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1720.7s)]
*  Many! [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1721.7s)]
*  That is true. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1722.7s)]
*  In 1993, the PLO recognized the state of Israel's right to exist in peace and security. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1723.7s)]
*  That was 1993. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1736.32s)]
*  So you're saying that the whole of Israel is a state of peace and security. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1739.48s)]
*  in the world of existing peace and security. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1747.86s)]
*  That was 1993. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1749.6s)]
*  It's part of... And who ended that peace process? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1750.8999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1752.6999999999998s)]
*  It's part of... Who ended that peace process? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1753.8s)]
*  Yes. Rabin's widow blames Netanyahu. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1755.3s)]
*  She says my husband's dead. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1756.84s)]
*  Rod Rabin's widow does. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1758.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1759.24s)]
*  And Arafat walked away from it as well. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1760.34s)]
*  Isn't it weird that you are more pro-Netanyahu [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1761.84s)]
*  than Rabin, Barack, Olmert? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1763.4799999999998s)]
*  It's weird that Joe Walsh is more pro-Netanyahu [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1765.34s)]
*  than Israeli leaders who blame Netanyahu for this. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1767.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm pro-Israel. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1769.6799999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1770.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm pro-Israel. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1771.6799999999998s)]
*  Because the Israelis don't agree with you. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1772.78s)]
*  Thousands of Israelis took to the... [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1773.8799999999999s)]
*  And I do not sit in front of you [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1774.9799999999998s)]
*  because this is all one-sided, like you pretty much say. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1776.0s)]
*  You do. You do. That's not... [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1778.24s)]
*  Joe, you're lying. Okay, I'm gonna read... [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1779.44s)]
*  Like you pretty much say. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1780.78s)]
*  I'm gonna read the quote to the viewers. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1781.88s)]
*  -"It is on the Palestinians." That's what you just said. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1782.98s)]
*  I stand by that. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1784.98s)]
*  So you just lied. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1785.98s)]
*  No, hold on. I didn't just lie. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1787.08s)]
*  Joe, 10 seconds ago you said, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1788.26s)]
*  I didn't say I put it all on the Palestinians. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1789.56s)]
*  I'm gonna read the quote again. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1790.76s)]
*  I don't... Meti, I don't put it all [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1791.8600000000001s)]
*  on the Palestinian people. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  Yes. It is on the Palestinians. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1794.46s)]
*  Israel has always wanted peace. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1795.76s)]
*  That is putting it all on the Palestinians. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1796.76s)]
*  No, hold on. No, it's not. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1798.06s)]
*  I'll read it a third time. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1799.16s)]
*  That's all it would take. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1800.22s)]
*  Meti, don't read it a third time. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1801.3200000000002s)]
*  You can't pull my question out of my hand. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1802.6200000000001s)]
*  Let me answer the freaking question. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1803.92s)]
*  Yes, the Palestinian people have to say that. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1805.6200000000001s)]
*  And if they say that, Meti, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1809.7s)]
*  then the Israeli people have to accept that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1811.46s)]
*  I do believe... [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1814.3000000000002s)]
*  They have said it multiple times. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1815.4s)]
*  ...bullcrap. If the Palestinian... [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1816.5s)]
*  Well, you don't know what you're talking about. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1817.6000000000001s)]
*  No, you don't. If the Palestinian people... [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1818.7s)]
*  No, I can give you evidence. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1819.8000000000002s)]
*  You've not given any evidence today. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1820.9s)]
*  If the Palestinian people said tomorrow, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1822.0s)]
*  if they all rose up... [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1823.48s)]
*  They said it in 1993, 1988. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1824.78s)]
*  It was... [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1827.0800000000002s)]
*  The Arab Peace Initiative, 2002, 2007... [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1828.18s)]
*  It was part of the PLO chapter as of a few years ago. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1830.0s)]
*  It was... It's still part of Hamas's chapter. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1833.04s)]
*  That's Hamas, not the PLO. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1835.58s)]
*  Let me ask one last question, because we're out of time. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1836.78s)]
*  You don't support a two-state solution. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1839.08s)]
*  You have attacked the idea of a two-state solution. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1840.68s)]
*  So what do you propose, that millions of Palestinians [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1842.78s)]
*  just live under occupation and apartheid, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1845.48s)]
*  with no voting rights, no equality... [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1847.48s)]
*  It's not occupation, it's not apartheid. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1848.98s)]
*  Okay, you call whatever word you want. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1850.8600000000001s)]
*  Palestinians live with no voting rights, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1852.52s)]
*  no equality, no freedom, indefinitely. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1854.16s)]
*  That's the Joe Walsh solution. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1856.1200000000001s)]
*  Palestinians were given Gaza. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1857.5s)]
*  That's not what I asked. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1859.08s)]
*  No, I'm getting to my answer. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1860.18s)]
*  Palestinians were given Gaza, and look what they did with it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1861.58s)]
*  The Palestinians were given the West Bank. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1865.32s)]
*  When were they given the West Bank? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1867.7s)]
*  You're lying, Joe. They were never given the West Bank. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1869.1s)]
*  Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1870.8s)]
*  Israel controls everything in the West Bank. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1873.5s)]
*  I know that. I know that. After, again, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1875.3s)]
*  the history is littered with Israel being attacked. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1877.1s)]
*  But I'm not even asking history, I'm asking future. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1879.5s)]
*  I'm telling you... [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1881.14s)]
*  Joe, what do you think should happen [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1882.24s)]
*  to three million Palestinians living in the West Bank? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1883.54s)]
*  It should be Israel and the Palestinians... [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1886.58s)]
*  So they should have equal voting rights. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1888.46s)]
*  The Palestinians should live in Israel. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1889.8600000000001s)]
*  As Israeli citizens. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1891.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1893.0600000000002s)]
*  So one state. So you're in favor of one democratic state. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1894.16s)]
*  Yes. Absolutely. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1896.3000000000002s)]
*  And I know what you're thinking. I know where you're going. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1898.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you this. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1900.1000000000001s)]
*  No, no, I support that. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1901.2s)]
*  But I'm surprised to see you support that. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1902.5s)]
*  I've always supported that. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1903.8400000000001s)]
*  Because Arabs and Muslims who currently... [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1905.14s)]
*  But then you know that Palestinians [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1906.8400000000001s)]
*  would probably end up being the majority in that state, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1907.94s)]
*  which is why the Jewish people have blocked that for a long time. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1909.5400000000002s)]
*  I do know that. Maybe. I'm not convinced of that. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1911.3400000000001s)]
*  But you would say... [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1913.44s)]
*  You would say a solution to the Middle East [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1914.5400000000002s)]
*  would be to give all of the Palestinians [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1916.22s)]
*  in the West Bank and all of the Palestinian Gaza, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1917.78s)]
*  Israelis should have one state. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1919.3799999999999s)]
*  I would say... [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1920.78s)]
*  One equal state, which they have equal rights. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1921.8799999999999s)]
*  Do they have equal rights? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1923.42s)]
*  Can I just answer it? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1924.72s)]
*  Yes. A one-state solution. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1927.2s)]
*  The state is Israel. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1929.76s)]
*  The West Bank, Gaza, it's all Israel. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1931.26s)]
*  Everyone living in that state has equal rights. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1933.86s)]
*  I wrote an article... [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1936.8s)]
*  Well, then it's not Israel. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1937.8999999999999s)]
*  I wrote an article about that 13 years ago. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1939.0s)]
*  Well, we're almost in agreement, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1941.78s)]
*  because if they all had equal rights, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1942.8799999999999s)]
*  it wouldn't technically be Israel, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1943.98s)]
*  which is an ethno-state. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1944.98s)]
*  I think it would. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1946.08s)]
*  But I think we can both agree [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1947.1799999999998s)]
*  that it's a state where everyone's equal. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1949.08s)]
*  I don't care what we call it. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1950.78s)]
*  It would be Israel now, but a bigger Israel. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1952.08s)]
*  And maybe Israelis would be... [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1954.96s)]
*  Jews would be outnumbered. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1956.52s)]
*  But I don't think they would. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1958.22s)]
*  I don't care about names. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1959.32s)]
*  I want equal rights and everyone to have voting rights [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1960.4199999999998s)]
*  and freedom. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1962.0s)]
*  Do you? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1963.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1964.1999999999998s)]
*  Let's end on a note of agreement, then. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1965.3s)]
*  And I want the Israelis and everybody [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1966.3999999999999s)]
*  to be able to live in peace. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1968.06s)]
*  Joe Walsh, thank you for taking this time out [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1969.6999999999998s)]
*  to have this debate. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5JgcMPT3ro&t=1972.3s)]
