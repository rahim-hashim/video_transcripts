Video Description: Israel is once again rejecting global calls for a ceasefire. But this time, they’re not for Gaza. They’re for Lebanon – where Israel has now launched a violent and reckless escalation in their almost year-long cross-fire battle with Hezbollah.

Israel of course took that cross-fire to a whole new level last week, when they made hundreds of pagers suddenly explode across Lebanon after planting explosives in them, injuring thousands and killing a dozen people, including two children and four healthcare workers.

Not only did Israel then continue to set off even more explosives in Lebanon, in what they claimed was the targeting of Hezbollah fighters, they went even further, launching the most horrific and deadly airstrikes in Lebanon yet, killing even more civilians and overwhelming the country’s hospitals.
As Israel engages in a new wave of blatant propaganda to try and justify the spilling of even more Arab blood, Mehdi unpacks Israel’s “violent and reckless” assault on Lebanon and the false propaganda behind it.

Here are the five things that they’re not telling you about their horrific assault on Lebanon; the five things you need to know to cut through the B.S.

# “Violent and reckless”: 5 things you need to know about Israel and Lebanon
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [September 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM)
*  Israel is once again rejecting global calls for a ceasefire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=0.0s)]
*  But this time they're not for Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=3.6s)]
*  No, they're for Lebanon, where Israel has now launched [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  a violent and reckless escalation in their almost year-long [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=8.24s)]
*  crossfire battle with Hezbollah. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=11.52s)]
*  Israel, of course, took that crossfire to a whole new level [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=13.76s)]
*  last week when they made hundreds of pages suddenly explode [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=16.16s)]
*  across Lebanon after planting explosives in them, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=19.88s)]
*  injuring thousands and killing a dozen people, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=22.52s)]
*  including two children and four healthcare workers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=24.8s)]
*  Not only did Israel then continue to set off even more [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=27.96s)]
*  explosives in Lebanon in what they claimed was the targeting [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  of Hezbollah fighters, but this past Monday they went even [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  further, launching the most horrific and deadly air strikes [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=36.44s)]
*  in Lebanon yet, killing even more civilians and overwhelming [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=39.2s)]
*  the country's hospitals. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israel's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=43.96s)]
*  military to continue fighting on with, quote, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=46.08s)]
*  full force as they prepare for a potential ground invasion [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=47.92s)]
*  and continue to launch deadly strikes deep inside of Lebanon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  So, as Israel engages in a new wave of blatant propaganda [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=55.08s)]
*  to try and justify the spilling of even more Arab blood, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=59.16s)]
*  here are the five things that they're not telling you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=62.44s)]
*  about their horrific assault on Lebanon, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=65.0s)]
*  the five things you need to know to cut through the BS. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=66.76s)]
*  Number one, most of the attacks have been from Israel, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=70.92s)]
*  not Hezbollah. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=74.16s)]
*  Despite what Israel wants you to believe, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=75.32s)]
*  this is not a case of a besieged Jewish state [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=76.8s)]
*  suddenly defending itself after showing restraint [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=79.56s)]
*  for months and months. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=82.0s)]
*  No, since the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah began [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=83.48s)]
*  on October the 8th, Israel has carried out 82% [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=86.44s)]
*  of all the attacks between the two sides, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=89.64s)]
*  according to ACLAD, a very respected non-profit [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=91.72s)]
*  monitoring group, which has even been funded [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=94.32s)]
*  by the US State Department and the German government [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=96.44s)]
*  in the past. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=98.4s)]
*  Oh, and those numbers don't even include the pages [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  and walkie-talkies that blew up and killed people, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=102.03999999999999s)]
*  or even the huge numbers of Israeli strikes [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=104.6s)]
*  from this past week that killed huge numbers of people. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=106.44s)]
*  So can we please stop talking about Israeli restraint? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=109.4s)]
*  Number two, and on that note, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=113.76s)]
*  Israel is killing Lebanese civilians, a lot of them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=115.84s)]
*  Just take a look at Monday, when Israel's airstrikes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=120.16000000000001s)]
*  on Lebanon killed over 550 people, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  including 50 children and 94 women, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=125.68s)]
*  marking Lebanon's deadliest day in decades. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  And no, the rest of those killed weren't a bunch [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=132.24s)]
*  of Hezbollah fighters either. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  According to Lebanese Health Minister, Dr. Firas Abiyad, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=135.68s)]
*  the quote, overwhelming majority, if not all, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=138.4s)]
*  of the dead were civilians. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=141.8s)]
*  And before people try to dismiss those numbers, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=144.0s)]
*  as they do in Gaza when they say, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=146.08s)]
*  you can't trust a Hamas-controlled health ministry, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=147.64000000000001s)]
*  the health ministry in Lebanon isn't controlled by Hezbollah, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=150.84s)]
*  and Dr. Abiyad is not affiliated with Hezbollah in any way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=153.36s)]
*  Don't just take it from me, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=156.84s)]
*  take it from the super pro-Israel New York Times, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=157.84s)]
*  which pointed out that Dr. Abiyad is generally considered [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=160.0s)]
*  apolitical and won praise and prominence [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=162.88s)]
*  for his data-driven assessments [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=165.4s)]
*  during the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=167.2s)]
*  Number three, the human shields excuse [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=169.76s)]
*  really doesn't work in Lebanon. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=172.6s)]
*  In a video message on Monday, Netanyahu told the Lebanese [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=174.48s)]
*  people that Hezbollah is apparently using them as, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  wait for it, human shields. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=180.2s)]
*  How original. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  But just a few days before that, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=184.2s)]
*  former Israeli military spokesman, Jonathan Konrikes, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=185.48s)]
*  actually went on Piers Morgan's show [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=188.28s)]
*  and told the viewers the exact opposite. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=190.68s)]
*  Have a listen. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=193.12s)]
*  Here in Lebanon, until now, the situation is that Hezbollah [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=194.04s)]
*  has so far distinguished itself from civilian population. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel has been able to take out more than 500 Hezbollah [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=201.76s)]
*  operatives and with absolutely minimal collateral damage [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=209.0s)]
*  Hezbollah hasn't been hiding amongst civilians yet. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=209.84s)]
*  You heard that, right? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=213.48s)]
*  Not only does Israel know Hezbollah is not using [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=215.0s)]
*  their civilians as human shields, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=217.76s)]
*  but Konrikes is even admitting that his government [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=219.48s)]
*  knows how to avoid, quote, collateral damage. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=221.6s)]
*  So all the Lebanese civilians killed by Israeli airstrikes [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=224.84s)]
*  this week, I mean, I guess they were just for shits [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=227.32s)]
*  and giggles. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=229.44s)]
*  Number four, yet more genocidal rhetoric from Israel. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=231.0s)]
*  The Israeli government wants you to believe that this is all [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=235.16s)]
*  about security, about protecting ordinary Israelis [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=236.92s)]
*  at the northern border and that this war isn't against [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=239.56s)]
*  Lebanon or the people of Lebanon, but only against Hezbollah. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=242.12s)]
*  The problem is that, like with Gaza, their ministers [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  can't stop sounding genocidal in public [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=249.04s)]
*  when they talk about Lebanon. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=251.2s)]
*  Just have a listen to what Israel's education minister, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=252.56s)]
*  Yoav Kish, had to say on a live television interview [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  just a few days ago. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=258.4s)]
*  There is no difference between Hezbollah and Lebanon. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=260.47999999999996s)]
*  Lebanon will be destroyed by light as things are. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=264.2s)]
*  Lebanon will not be the same as they know it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=267.24s)]
*  I'm not going to deal with Hezbollah's sidekicks. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  The price of the aggression from Lebanon's blood [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=272.68s)]
*  will pay off Lebanon's state. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=275.56s)]
*  Annihilated, he said. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=277.24s)]
*  Annihilated. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=279.15999999999997s)]
*  Yes, despite Netanyahu claiming that Israel's war [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  is just against Hezbollah, Kish purposely made it clear, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=283.04s)]
*  very clear, that in reality they're not even going to try [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  and do targeted attacks on only Hezbollah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=290.36s)]
*  Their plan is to do to Lebanon what they've done to Gaza, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  plain and simple. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=295.36s)]
*  Then there is Israel's diaspora affairs minister, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=297.24s)]
*  Amir Qaeda, who took to Twitter and claimed that, quote, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  Lebanon, even though it has a flag and even though [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  it has political institutions, does not meet the definition [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=305.12s)]
*  of a country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  How's that for genocidal? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=309.56s)]
*  Lebanon isn't even a real country, apparently. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=311.2s)]
*  Sounds like Vladimir Putin talking about Ukraine. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=313.88s)]
*  Chikley went on to propose kicking Lebanese citizens, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=316.92s)]
*  the Shia ones, out of parts of southern Lebanon [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=319.52s)]
*  and turning those parts into, quote, buffer zones, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=322.12s)]
*  which would be controlled by the Israeli military, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=324.84000000000003s)]
*  and which we know is just a polite code word [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=327.16s)]
*  for ethnic cleansing followed by illegal Israeli settlements. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=329.64s)]
*  Number five, you want to talk about terrorism? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=334.0s)]
*  It's Israel that's committing terrorism. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=336.96s)]
*  Let's state the obvious. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=339.64s)]
*  If Hezbollah set off a pager to explode [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=340.76s)]
*  in an Israeli grocery store or in an American hospital, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=343.12s)]
*  there's no way that American senators like John Fetterman [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  would have praised those attacks. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=349.32s)]
*  They would be denouncing them as a new age [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=351.28s)]
*  of illegal terrorism. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=353.28s)]
*  They'd be calling in the CIA. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=354.76s)]
*  And yet, just listen to what former CIA director, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=356.96s)]
*  Leon Panetta, said about Israel's terrorist attack [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=359.56s)]
*  with exploding pagers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=363.28s)]
*  It's a ability to be able to place an explosive [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=365.12s)]
*  in technology that is very prevalent these days [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=369.52s)]
*  and turn it into a war of terror, really, a war of terror. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=374.32s)]
*  This is something new. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=379.8s)]
*  Is it terrorism? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=381.4s)]
*  I don't think there's any question [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=383.16s)]
*  that it's a form of terrorism. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, even the former director of the CIA [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=386.24s)]
*  thinks Israel has opened a new Pandora's box [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=388.36s)]
*  when it comes to acts of terror. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=391.16s)]
*  But hey, it's all just self-defense, right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=393.4s)]
*  Look, as we've seen with Gaza, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=396.4s)]
*  no matter how horrific or violent [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=398.04s)]
*  or illegal Israel's attacks get, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  no matter how genocidal the Israeli rhetoric gets, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=401.44s)]
*  the Israeli government will always find a way [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=404.4s)]
*  to play the victim card and get the uncritical [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=406.32s)]
*  and credulous support of both Western politicians [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=408.92s)]
*  and Western media. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=411.52s)]
*  We already have over 40,000 dead in Gaza. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=413.24s)]
*  To avoid a similar number in Lebanon [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=416.44s)]
*  in the coming days and weeks, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=418.84s)]
*  all of us need to make sure that our leaders [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=421.0s)]
*  and influencers don't fall for the same [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=422.92s)]
*  pro-war propaganda again. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrqEJX0EOM&t=425.44s)]
