Video Description: Amanda Litman, Run for Something co-founder and author of ‘When We’re in Charge,’ discusses the US’s gerontocracy problem and how younger leadership could revitalize the Democratic Party.
At just 27 years old, Litman created the political organization that recruits Millennials and Gen Z to run for local office. Now, nearly a decade later, she shares what Millennials and Gen Z bring to the table in her latest book, When We’re in Charge: The Next Generation’s Guide to Leadership.
Litman tells Mehdi, “When we bring fresh energy and fresh eyes to the table, we can change what happens next… The folks that got us into this mess, that got us to this point, do not have the skills or the stomach in many circumstances – especially in politics – to get us to the next one.”
Watch this full interview to hear Litman dive into why the US’s leadership is so old compared to other Western democracies and why Trump didn’t face the concerns about his age as Biden did in the 2024 presidential race.

# Could Gen Z Save the Democratic Party?
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do)
*  Every few months, another hit piece on Gen Z and millennials in the workforce makes the rounds online. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=0.0s)]
*  And if you're part of the discourse, you've probably heard all the stereotypes by now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=5.8s)]
*  They're lazy, they're unprofessional, they're difficult to work with, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=9.6s)]
*  and they don't ever want to come into the office. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=12.6s)]
*  But run for something co-founder Amanda Litman begs to differ. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=15.0s)]
*  At just 27 years old, she created the political organization that recruits millennials and Gen Z to run for local office. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=18.0s)]
*  Now, nearly a decade later, she's reflected on her path to leadership [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  and what millennials and Gen Z bring to the table in her latest book, When We're In Charge, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=28.0s)]
*  The Next Generation's Guide to Leadership, Litman lays out the younger generation's perspective on work [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=32.6s)]
*  and how they can break the cycle of bad boomer leadership. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=37.8s)]
*  And in a moment when American politics is dominated by the gerontocracy, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=41.2s)]
*  Gen Z and millennials could be the key to saving the Democratic Party. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=45.2s)]
*  Amanda Litman joins me now to discuss. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=48.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=50.2s)]
*  Congratulations on the book. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=51.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=53.8s)]
*  A lot to talk about. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=55.6s)]
*  So much stuff that's so relevant right now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=56.2s)]
*  But let's just talk about you first. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=58.0s)]
*  You co-founded Run for Something in 2017 when you were just 27 years old. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=59.2s)]
*  Back then, we weren't having the same conversations about gerontocracy that we're having now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=64.2s)]
*  So what motivated you then to run to start Run for Something? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=68.6s)]
*  So I'd worked for Hillary for two years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=72.4s)]
*  About a week after the election, devastated, crushed, I started hearing from friends I'd gone to high school and college with. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=74.2s)]
*  Hey, Amanda, I'm a public school teacher in Chicago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=79.6s)]
*  I'm thinking about running for office. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=81.9s)]
*  You're the only person I know that works in politics. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=83.5s)]
*  What do I do? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=85.2s)]
*  And at the time, if you were young, in the mid-20s, newly excited about politics, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=86.2s)]
*  and you wanted to do more than vote and more than volunteer, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=90.2s)]
*  there was nowhere you could go that would be guaranteed to take your call. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  So I reached out to a whole bunch of people, one of whom became my co-founder. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=95.4s)]
*  We wrote a plan, we built a website, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=98.8s)]
*  and then we launched Run for Something on Trump's first inauguration day, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=100.60000000000001s)]
*  thinking this will be a small side hobby. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  Eight years later, we built a pipeline of more than 210,000 young people across the country who say they want to run. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  20% of them have signed up in the last six months [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  and helped elect more than 1,500 people across nearly every state, all millennials. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=116.3s)]
*  1,500 over the last eight years? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=121.1s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=122.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=123.1s)]
*  In the book, you write our generations, millennial and Gen Z, lead differently. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=123.6s)]
*  We have no patience for bullshit. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=127.5s)]
*  We demand authenticity, or at least perceived authenticity. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=128.9s)]
*  We show emotion when it's real, but we're also vigilant about boundaries. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=131.9s)]
*  We're collectively trying to break the cycle in nearly every aspect of our lives. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=134.9s)]
*  Many critics will say, well, hold on. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=139.6s)]
*  The issue is that you don't have experience. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=143.2s)]
*  That's the issue. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=146.1s)]
*  Great. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  You know, you'll be more dynamic than the people who came before you, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=147.39999999999998s)]
*  the people who came before you built up experience. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=149.89999999999998s)]
*  How do you respond to that classic criticism? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=152.5s)]
*  Liking this video? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=155.0s)]

*  You'll be supporting fearless, independent journalism. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=168.6s)]
*  I think it misses the point, one, that millennials are in our late 30s and early 40s now, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=171.7s)]
*  so many of us do have experience. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=176.4s)]
*  But two, that when we bring fresh energy and fresh eyes to the table, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=177.8s)]
*  we can change what happens next. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=182.7s)]
*  I think especially in this moment, a lot of the folks that built our systems and institutions [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=184.9s)]
*  did not build them in a way that works or that serves everyone. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  The thing that I keep coming back to is that the folks that got us into this mess, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=193.1s)]
*  that got us to this point, do not have the skills or the stomach in many circumstances, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=196.29999999999998s)]
*  especially in politics, to get us to the next one. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=201.5s)]
*  We need fresh energy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=204.6s)]
*  We need, in some ways, if not inexperience, new experience to get us over this crisis. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=205.7s)]
*  On that note, in 2024, the average age in the House was 59, and in the Senate it was 64. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=212.6s)]
*  Joe Biden was 82 when he left office. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=218.8s)]
*  Donald Trump is about to turn 79. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=221.5s)]
*  How do we get to this point? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=223.8s)]
*  Why is our leadership in the US so old compared to other Western democracies? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=225.0s)]
*  You know, I think there's a bunch of reasons. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=228.8s)]
*  One is that the structure of these institutions makes it much easier for older people to run for office. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=230.6s)]
*  They have more access to wealth. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=235.0s)]
*  They can often be retired or have independent money that allows them to run for office, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=236.3s)]
*  especially for Congress. It becomes your full-time job. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=241.7s)]
*  They have the time to build up political relationships. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  In the House Democratic Caucus in particular, seniority is really privileged. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=247.5s)]
*  We've seen this a lot with a lot of the fights over seniority and chairmanships, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  where the person who's been in office for the longest is sort of next in line. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=255.2s)]
*  We've also seen, in the local level with run for something candidates, that these folks, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=261.0s)]
*  like they have jobs that they have to do nine to five. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=265.7s)]
*  They have young kids. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=268.0s)]
*  They maybe don't have access to as much money. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=269.5s)]
*  It's harder for them to take the time to run, which means you often don't get started until you're a little later in life, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=272.2s)]
*  which means you can't climb the ladder until you're a little later in life. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  It is structurally really difficult, but I think that's starting to change. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  We hope so. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=284.9s)]
*  We all remember when Joe Biden dropped out of the race last summer because of concerns about his age and mental competence. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=286.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, our current president, is about two and a half years younger. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  Why was he excluded from those concerns last year? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=296.09999999999997s)]
*  And why do we not pay the same attention to his batshit crazy statements right now every day? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=298.3s)]
*  God, it's such a good question. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=303.5s)]
*  I think part of it is the brand that Trump has built over the last 40 years in the public eye, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=305.2s)]
*  where he gets a pass because we still imagine him as the person that was on TV 20 or 30 years ago. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=309.0s)]
*  I think also he visually presents this image of being young and vigorous, even though he is not. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=315.2s)]
*  He also is shameless about lying. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=322.5s)]
*  And I think that we've, you know, in this conversation, we're having this moment about, you know, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=324.6s)]
*  whether Biden kept secrets about his health or his age or what was happening, where like Trump lied about having COVID. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=327.8s)]
*  He's had many secret health episodes we don't know anything about. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=334.1s)]
*  And he gets away with all of it because we know, like, oh, you can't really believe anything. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=336.9s)]
*  So we'll just take it and leave it as you see fit. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=340.3s)]
*  Like you, I'm a loud critic of your autocracy. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=343.9s)]
*  But at the same time, age isn't everything, is it? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=345.7s)]
*  And simply putting young people in charge isn't a silver bullet. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=348.6s)]
*  I look at someone like Bernie Sanders, who's in his 80s, but is drawing huge crowds, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=352.0s)]
*  pushing popular and populist policies, has a clear vision that resonates with young people and people across the age divide. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=356.6s)]
*  I look at him and then I look at Democratic Party rising star, Richie Torres of New York, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=363.9s)]
*  who is 37 years old, but just seems to be a pawn of special interests, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=369.2s)]
*  whether it's crypto or whether it's the pro-Israel lobby or whatever it is. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=372.8s)]
*  It's a little simplistic to say it's just about age, right? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=376.7s)]
*  We can agree on that. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=379.7s)]
*  We can have old dynamic people and young useless people. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=380.9s)]
*  You know, no generation is a monolith. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=383.4s)]
*  It is always a shortcut to account for a whole bunch of different ways to bring people in. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=385.0s)]
*  But I would say, generally speaking, most of our older leaders have failed to rise in this moment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=390.5s)]
*  And many of our younger ones have shown that they can do it and do what we need to take on the fight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=395.5s)]
*  We have to win. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=400.2s)]
*  You worked on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=401.2s)]
*  Many would argue that the Democratic Party's decline began with that election. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=404.0s)]
*  Right now, the party's approval rating is at a historic low, 38 percent, according to Pew. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=410.3s)]
*  How do Democrats restore trust in the party, given there's been a decade of quite a lot of negativity? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=415.7s)]
*  You know, I think part of it is making sure we get better messengers to get the word out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=421.59999999999997s)]
*  And that's what Run for Something does, is we try and get real people who have lived experience [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=425.0s)]
*  that reflects where voters are, who are renters, who are paying child care bills, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=429.2s)]
*  who are looking at the housing market and saying, I'm never going to be able to buy a home, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=433.4s)]
*  who are thinking about how they can't afford to live where their family is. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=438.1s)]
*  They can't necessarily afford to take the job or have the career that they want. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=441.2s)]
*  We need messengers who can really break through and can show up in non-political spaces and sound like normal people. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=445.2s)]
*  That, I think, is a huge part of the battle, along with more media like this and such spaces like this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=451.7s)]
*  Normal people, that's a very high bar. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=457.2s)]
*  It is, like, amazing when you sit down and think about it, though. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=459.3s)]
*  How many current members of Congress do you think could show up in a non-political space [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=462.1s)]
*  and have a conversation that actually is interesting and engaging? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=468.6s)]
*  Not that many. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=469.40000000000003s)]
*  Not that many, sadly. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=470.20000000000005s)]
*  David Hogg, the newly elected 25-year-old vice chair of the DNC, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  he recently announced in his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, would commit $20 million to fund younger candidates, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=475.3s)]
*  more dynamic candidates who would unseat people he thinks are ineffective Democratic incumbents. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=481.3s)]
*  Do you think primaring incumbents with younger candidates is the way forward for the Democrats? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  I think it's got to be one of many tools in our arsenal. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=491.0s)]
*  The first candidate that David's PAC endorsed is actually in an open race. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=493.8s)]
*  Robert Peters, a state senator in Illinois who run for something, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=496.59999999999997s)]
*  worked with many years ago in his competitive state senate race. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=499.5s)]
*  There are incredible local electeds across the country in nearly every state, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  including in nearly every House Democratic district where a representative over the age of 75 is currently serving, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=507.7s)]
*  who are experienced or charismatic, who could run and win and lead in a way we need in this moment. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=514.1s)]
*  We got to consider every possible avenue to get new folks into power. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=520.0s)]
*  Hogg's decision has been met with the DNC basically cracking down and trying to nullify his election as vice chair of the DNC. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=524.3s)]
*  Is that basically the Democratic Party telling on itself that it gets challenged internally by a new young up-and-coming person [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=533.8s)]
*  and they decide to basically punish that person? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=539.8s)]
*  You know, I have complicated feelings about this because I actually think it's really important that as the DNC goes into its most important role, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=542.2s)]
*  which is setting up the presidential primary process for 2028, that it be a neutral arbiter. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=548.4s)]
*  Because as we just talked about, there's immense distrust of this organization and the institution. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=552.6999999999999s)]
*  I think David could have done this work outside of the party leadership structure. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=557.6999999999999s)]
*  In fact, it would probably serve the party better if he did. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=561.3s)]
*  He chose to run for vice chair. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=563.8s)]
*  That was his call, knowing this would be a problem. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=565.3s)]
*  It's there a mess to figure out. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=568.4s)]
*  I do think it's really important though that the DNC be seen as an institution that can be trusted and is neutral in primaries moving forward [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=570.0s)]
*  as we go into that primary process after 2026. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=578.3s)]
*  Just one last question on a non-party political question. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=580.9s)]
*  You're an advocate for a four-day work week. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  You've even implemented it at Run for Something. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=587.3s)]
*  Do you think it's a policy we could see become common practice over the next decade? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  In Europe, it's been entertained much more than in the US where we have this whole Protestant work. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=594.5s)]
*  I think you work and work and work and work and you kind of have four days. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=598.8s)]
*  You know, we barely struggled to get vacation, two weeks paid vacation in this country. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=601.0999999999999s)]
*  How does a four-day work week come about? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=606.6999999999999s)]
*  We've seen congressional hearings on it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=609.1s)]
*  We've seen auto workers and unions fight for it. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=610.6s)]
*  We have seen industries as varied as education and tech and politics and elsewhere institute it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=613.1s)]
*  It is the truth in the light. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=620.1s)]
*  When you get four days to work hard and to be really intentional about how you're using that time and then three days with your family, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=622.0s)]
*  with your partners to be a better citizen, more time to engage with your community, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=628.0s)]
*  it frees up your energy to be better in every part of your life. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=632.3000000000001s)]
*  I think we got to reimagine what the work week looks like. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=636.7s)]
*  The 40-hour work week is older than the boomers. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=638.7s)]
*  It may no longer serve us and we should think and be expansive and creative about what it means to make work part of our life, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=640.9000000000001s)]
*  but not all of our life. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=647.9000000000001s)]
*  And I think no matter what kind of industry you work in and I know we are both probably workaholics. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=649.4000000000001s)]
*  I would love to have a six-day work week to be honest right now. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=653.7s)]
*  I love what I do. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=655.9000000000001s)]
*  But wouldn't it be nice if you could have a little more time to be free to do other things [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=657.7s)]
*  besides work, even if that's different work. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=661.9s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=664.4s)]
*  Amanda Lippman, thank you so much for coming on the show. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=666.4s)]
*  Congratulations on the book. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=668.4s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W55V-Ng5Do&t=669.4s)]
