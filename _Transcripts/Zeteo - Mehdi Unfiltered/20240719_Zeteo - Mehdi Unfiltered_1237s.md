# ‘Trump would upend our democracy’: 2 former Trump officials react to his RNC speech
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY)
*  Who better to discuss everything RNC and Trump with than two former members of the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=0.0s)]
*  administration who thankfully are no longer supporters of Donald J. Trump. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=4.8s)]
*  Sarah Matthews served as the former president's White House deputy press secretary and campaign [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=8.44s)]
*  spokesperson until she resigned shortly after the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=12.48s)]
*  In her resignation statement, Sarah said, our nation needs a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Olivia Troy, on the other hand, quit her job in the administration many months before the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=21.72s)]
*  January 6 attack. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=25.34s)]
*  At the time, she served as adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence on counterterrorism [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=26.64s)]
*  and homeland security. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=31.22s)]
*  She was also a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force until she left her position in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=32.4s)]
*  July of 2020. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=36.56s)]
*  Olivia quit over Trump's response to the pandemic that he was praising himself for at the RNC [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=37.84s)]
*  on Thursday night. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=43.2s)]
*  Olivia, Sarah, thank you for joining me on May the Unfiltered. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=44.2s)]
*  Sarah, let me start with you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=46.88s)]
*  Watching your former boss in Milwaukee on stage, was that a new tone for you? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=48.92s)]
*  So we saw a new tone from Trump that maybe lasted the first 10 or 15 minutes of his speech. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=54.8s)]
*  Look, him recounting his near-death experience with the attempted assassination was gripping. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=60.8s)]
*  And it was his first time telling the American people the story from his perspective on air. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=67.72s)]
*  And there was a little bit of unity there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=73.32s)]
*  He said that he was going to be a president for not half of America, but all Americans. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=76.08s)]
*  The unity that we were promised from the Trump campaign quickly faded as we got later into [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=81.08s)]
*  the speech, where he started saying things like, crazy Nancy Pelosi, Democrats cheat [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=86.6s)]
*  in the elections. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=92.72s)]
*  He said that all the investigations against him were witch hunts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=94.28s)]
*  And it seemed like he was reverting to his usual campaign rally speech. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  And it wasn't that inspiring. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=102.16s)]
*  I didn't really hear a vision for the American people or him talking about the problems that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  they are facing. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  It seemed to just be all about him. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=110.74s)]
*  And so I think that the unifier that we were promised lasted for, like I said, 10 or 15 [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=113.58s)]
*  minutes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=119.86s)]
*  And then Trump is always going to be Trump and revert to his old ways. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=120.86s)]
*  Olivia, 10 to 15 minutes of a 90-minute speech was an epically long speech. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=124.82s)]
*  I wanted to go to bed, and he wouldn't stop going. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=129.46s)]
*  You worked for the man. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=133.14s)]
*  Were you surprised when, I don't know, Hannibal Lecter made an appearance from the campaign [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=134.38s)]
*  rally? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=139.74s)]
*  Because a lot of journalists, not me, but a lot of journalists were like, oh, we didn't [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=140.74s)]
*  expect this. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  We were told he was going to be unifying. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  You worked for the man. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=146.98000000000002s)]
*  Were you surprised? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=147.98000000000002s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, actually, I was actually disappointed that he didn't bring in the sharks into the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  conversation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=154.22s)]
*  Yes, we missed shark attacks. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=155.22s)]
*  Because I was really looking forward to that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=156.22s)]
*  I mean, he would have been better off singing Baby Shark, and that would have unified the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=157.22s)]
*  country more behind it, of being sick of getting the song stuck in our heads. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=161.38s)]
*  But no, it was exactly what I expected. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=165.82000000000002s)]
*  I think the entire week was a manufactured performance for him. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=167.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=172.22000000000003s)]
*  Do I think that it was a traumatic event? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=173.22000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that would be for anyone. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=175.22000000000003s)]
*  But he goes completely off the rails, and then it was just one lie after another. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=178.10000000000002s)]
*  And I'll say this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=183.46s)]
*  There was a portion of the speech that made me wince. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=184.46s)]
*  And that was when he referred to COVID as the China virus. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=188.18s)]
*  And that point in particular, many, really bothered me. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=193.38s)]
*  Because I had flashbacks of sitting in the White House, my conversations with former [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=196.46s)]
*  Vice President Mike Pence about saying, please don't use that term. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=201.18s)]
*  Because when you use that term, you're increasing bias and hate crimes against Asian Americans. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=204.86s)]
*  Trump was told the same thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=210.5s)]
*  I'm sure Sarah's aware of this on staff. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=211.58s)]
*  So hearing that, I was like, really? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=214.26s)]
*  This is unity? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=217.66s)]
*  This is unity after you have actually had an assassination attempt? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=219.28s)]
*  And this is what you're pushing out to the American public? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=224.28s)]
*  Something that's going to radicalize people again? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=227.24s)]
*  Bringing that back into the conversation? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=229.44s)]
*  That to me just was a wrap for me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=231.64s)]
*  I mean, that was it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=234.48s)]
*  Summarize this Trump in a nutshell. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=235.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=237.32s)]
*  Sarah, as someone who has warned against the authoritarian threat from Donald Trump, I [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=238.32s)]
*  don't know about you, but I was kind of, I was wincing, to use Olivia's phrase, when [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=243.44s)]
*  I watched a crowd full of people shout, fight, fight, fight, with fists raised, some of them [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=247.36s)]
*  holding mass deportation signs. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=252.4s)]
*  It doesn't scream to me as president of all the country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=255.08s)]
*  It tells me that actually those of us who are worried about an authoritarian presidency [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=257.92s)]
*  come 2025 have a lot to be worried about. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=265.16s)]
*  I found one of the most kind of shocking moments to me during the speech was when Trump claimed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=266.16s)]
*  the one who's actually saving democracy and gave me quite a chuckle because we know from [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=273.84s)]
*  looking at project 2025, what his plans are for a second Trump term and how he would upend [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  our democracy as we know it. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=287.03999999999996s)]
*  And then as you mentioned, seeing the signs in the crowd that are saying mass deportations [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=289.08s)]
*  and calling for things like that, that's not a quite unifying message either. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=295.12s)]
*  And so I just found it hilarious that it seemed like some in the media took the bait from [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=300.0s)]
*  the Trump campaign where they said that he ripped up the old speech and that it was going [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=304.84s)]
*  to be this unifying message and that he was a changed man. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=309.08s)]
*  And what we saw on display is that, sure, did this experience probably change him in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=312.32s)]
*  some ways? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=317.96s)]
*  I have to imagine that coming that close to death would, but at the end of the day, Trump [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=318.96s)]
*  And I think that moving forward, he's still going to use the same dangerous rhetoric that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=325.08s)]
*  we've seen from him and his campaign rallies. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=331.0s)]
*  And I don't think that his platform has changed that much. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=333.88s)]
*  So Olivia, on the subject of platform and policy, I mean, Sarah rightly brought up project [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=337.24s)]
*  2025, which people are rightly worried about. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=342.56s)]
*  Question to you, though, we talk a lot about policy, but with Trump, the bigger problem [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=346.32s)]
*  always is not policy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  It's actually him personally as a person and the people he surrounds himself with. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=351.4s)]
*  I've been talking to a lot of people who say, well, we survived one term of Trump, we can [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=355.88s)]
*  survive another. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=359.32s)]
*  And it's like, but there's not going to be a Rex Tillerson or a Jim Mattis or a Mike Pence, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=360.32s)]
*  who I've criticized a lot. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=364.56s)]
*  But on January 6th, at least he did what JD Vance says he wouldn't do. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=366.2s)]
*  JD Vance, the new running mate, has said he would have done what Trump asked him to do. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=369.56s)]
*  Those people won't be there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=374.44s)]
*  There'll be a lot of really extreme people. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=375.44s)]
*  We're talking about General Michael Flynn possibly returning to the cabinet. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=378.44s)]
*  We're talking about the cash patels of this world, very extreme people. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=381.48s)]
*  And we saw at this RNC, we saw convicted criminals like Peter Navarro on stage. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=386.0s)]
*  We saw Paul Manafort walking around the convention hall. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=390.74s)]
*  Donald Trump was introduced by Dana White, a man who's on tape hitting his partner. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=393.76s)]
*  Kid Rock. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=398.52s)]
*  Hulk Hogan, all of whom have used the N-word. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=399.92s)]
*  I mean, these are not very nice people. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=402.92s)]
*  They're the kind of people who push dangerous rhetoric. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=406.2s)]
*  They're the kind of people who make threats against people they don't like. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=409.64s)]
*  What has that been like for you as someone who turned against Trump, when you see people [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=412.56s)]
*  say, well, it'll be fine, we'll survive four more years? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=416.52s)]
*  It's incredibly frustrating. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=419.36s)]
*  And, like, I'll tell you this. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=420.36s)]
*  I worked with a lot of incredible people that were there to try and do the right thing in [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=422.12s)]
*  the first Trump administration. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=427.64s)]
*  And so what I saw over time was people changed and people transformed and people started [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=430.36s)]
*  to fall in line. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=436.32s)]
*  And so when I hear, you know, I hear a lot of talk about democracy and authoritarianism, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=437.36s)]
*  and I do hear those comments from people, even, you know, think tank people, academics [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=441.66s)]
*  who say, but the public service and others, people will hold the line. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=445.04s)]
*  Well, I'm concerned about that because people eventually, it's fear. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=450.24s)]
*  It's fear about being persecuted against. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=457.6s)]
*  It's fear about becoming a target. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=459.72s)]
*  It's fear about what is going to happen with that executive order that I saw the draft, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=461.46000000000004s)]
*  I know many others saw the draft of when it comes to personnel across the government, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=465.76000000000005s)]
*  where they were going to start installing loyalists and removing all the policy people, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=469.36s)]
*  Schedule F. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=472.32000000000005s)]
*  Which is embedded into Project 2025, right? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=473.32000000000005s)]
*  There are a lot of policies that were done in the Trump administration that were started [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=476.24s)]
*  that are engulfed in that plan. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=480.56s)]
*  So regardless of whether they want to distance from it or not, those authors, were there [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  the first time around, they were already trying to do it. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=487.0s)]
*  What they did was they learned the lessons from the first time around, and now they know [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=489.36s)]
*  how to more effectively do it and remove the roadblocks and the people out of the way. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=492.68s)]
*  So that's my concern in terms of that space, because the authors of that plan are former [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=496.6s)]
*  members of Trump's cabinet, they're senior officials, they're people that were in those [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=502.0s)]
*  policy meetings, they're the people that have the pen when it comes to what they're actually [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=504.82s)]
*  going to do to this country. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=508.88s)]
*  And you know, one thing that really, I got to say, makes me irate, is watching people [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  like the Heritage Foundation and say, oh, the left, oh, the Libs, all of that. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=515.94s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=519.3800000000001s)]
*  It's moderate conservatives like myself, moderate rational conservatives like Sarah and others. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=520.7s)]
*  We all have a problem with this plan. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=526.7s)]
*  We know what this is. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=528.22s)]
*  Very good point. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=529.22s)]
*  And Sarah, Olivia mentioned people falling into line. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=530.7s)]
*  And that makes me think of a certain running mate of Donald J. Trump, a man who once called [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=534.46s)]
*  Trump America's Hitler, called him an idiot, called him reprehensible. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=538.3800000000001s)]
*  JD Vance on stage this week, being applauded, being praised by Donald Trump on Thursday [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=542.62s)]
*  night. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=547.26s)]
*  He's now loyal, 100 percent MAGA. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=548.26s)]
*  He is the vice president. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  People are talking about him as the heir apparent. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=551.74s)]
*  What do you make of JD Vance? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=554.62s)]
*  Should we be worried about him because he is now a dangerous MAGA ideologue who says, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=556.38s)]
*  you know, I would have overturned the election? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=560.86s)]
*  Or is it, ah, you know, he's just an opportunist. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=562.8199999999999s)]
*  He doesn't believe this stuff. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=565.3s)]
*  Look, I am an Ohioan. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=567.02s)]
*  So I know JD Vance well. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=569.9s)]
*  And I believe that Trump picked him because he wanted someone who would be an attack [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=572.62s)]
*  dog for him and who wouldn't push back on him, who would not be a Mike Pence. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=578.0600000000001s)]
*  He obviously, Mike Pence was loyal up until he wasn't until the very end when Trump asked [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=583.86s)]
*  him to go against the Constitution and try to overturn the election. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=589.22s)]
*  And Mike Pence wouldn't go along with it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=594.26s)]
*  We've heard that JD Vance says he wouldn't have done what Mike Pence did on January 6. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=595.9000000000001s)]
*  And so I think that sure, JD Vance is an opportunist. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=600.5s)]
*  We've heard all of his comments during the 2016 election cycle and how he probably really [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  feels about Trump deep down. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=610.5400000000001s)]
*  And I think that being an opportunist, being an opportunist is almost more alarming because [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=612.5s)]
*  he's willing to say or do anything. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=618.5s)]
*  Look, he's a first term senator and now he's a vice presidential nominee pick. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=620.6600000000001s)]
*  And so he's going to be willing to do anything to cling to power. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=625.1800000000001s)]
*  And I think that it's very dangerous to see because he is a very smart man. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=629.4200000000001s)]
*  And so I think he's played the game well to be in the position that he's in now. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  Oh, he has. He's not even yet 40 years old. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=638.9s)]
*  Olivia, let's talk about Mike Pence briefly, because you and I had many discussions when [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=641.34s)]
*  I was at MSNBC and I was very critical of Mike Pence. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=644.86s)]
*  I remain very critical of Mike Pence. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=647.4200000000001s)]
*  But he did two things, which I will give him props for. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=649.4200000000001s)]
*  One is on January 6. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=651.98s)]
*  He didn't do what Trump asked him to do, at the risk to his own family. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=653.5s)]
*  And then he hasn't endorsed Donald Trump for re-election, his own vice president, unprecedented [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=656.82s)]
*  in American political modern history. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=662.0600000000001s)]
*  For the vice president to say, well, I'm not going to endorse him. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=664.22s)]
*  OK, he said some BS. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=666.26s)]
*  It's about his abortion position. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=667.4200000000001s)]
*  We all know why he didn't endorse him again. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=668.9000000000001s)]
*  And yet you have JD Vance now in position. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=671.74s)]
*  I've got to ask you about as someone who worked for Mike Pence, I'm going, you talk about [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=673.5400000000001s)]
*  going irate, I'm going mad watching the media coverage of JD Vance from the New York Times [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=678.02s)]
*  and all the cable. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=681.74s)]
*  Shouldn't every story about JD Vance begin with, well, he has to have a new running mate [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=682.74s)]
*  because the last guy almost got killed and was used to run with him again? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=689.7800000000001s)]
*  Isn't that the core story here that we're missing? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=690.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's the story, that this is unprecedented, that the fact that he had to go get somebody [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=692.3000000000001s)]
*  else because his own supporters tried to kill his, what would have been his running mate, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=702.58s)]
*  Because he wouldn't go along with the coup. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=703.58s)]
*  He wouldn't go along with the plot that everyone wanted him to do. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=704.58s)]
*  But to your point and to Sarah's point, Mike, my biggest concern about JD Vance is that [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=707.7s)]
*  he is the future of the Republican Party. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=711.98s)]
*  And so the story here is that for people like me and others who have been wanting to right [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=715.14s)]
*  the course of the party because I think it's better for the country to have two functioning [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=721.46s)]
*  parties instead of whatever circus we have going on right over here on the right, I'll [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=724.58s)]
*  say that this is worrisome to me because this pretty much puts the nail in the coffin that [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=728.86s)]
*  this is the party of Trumpism, that this movement is here for a longer term and we are going [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=733.86s)]
*  to have to figure out how to navigate it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=740.02s)]
*  So I worry about JD Vance. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=742.02s)]
*  He will be a loyalist till the very end. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=743.74s)]
*  So I think we need to be vigilant about what's happening in the upcoming election because [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=746.98s)]
*  I guarantee you that he will go to the end of the earth to make sure that they push whatever [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=751.02s)]
*  agenda as they want in terms of it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=756.1s)]
*  Just on a side note, I've been waiting for Democrats to say if the vice president has [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=759.18s)]
*  the power to overturn the election, are you all okay with Kamala Harris deciding who wins [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=762.66s)]
*  on January 6th? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=767.02s)]
*  Everyone good with that? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=768.02s)]
*  No one ever points out that the current vice president is not a Republican, so be careful [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=769.54s)]
*  what you wish for. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=772.5799999999999s)]
*  On that note, Olivia, very quickly before we run out of time, I've got to ask, you've [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=773.74s)]
*  been spending some time with the vice president, I believe in Michigan, you've done an event [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=777.3s)]
*  with her. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=780.54s)]
*  Do you believe she's ready to step up, take over from Joe Biden and lead the Democrats [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=782.06s)]
*  to victory over Donald Trump from behind in the polls, which is where they are right now? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=786.34s)]
*  We did an event in Michigan and it was an event to do outreach to conservative and Republican [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=791.9399999999999s)]
*  women. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=797.3s)]
*  I do believe that it was a very powerful event and the feedback that I've gotten was that [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=798.5799999999999s)]
*  it was very well received. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=802.4599999999999s)]
*  I've heard from Republican women who thought it was very well done. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=803.9s)]
*  They felt like they were being welcomed into the fold when it comes to women's rights. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=808.9s)]
*  I do believe that conservative women at the end of the day, women are going to stick by [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=811.9799999999999s)]
*  women. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=815.42s)]
*  We're going to stand by each other and we're going to get through this together. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=816.42s)]
*  What I saw was someone that really connected with the crowd, connects with people. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=820.5s)]
*  She's very strong on policy. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=824.78s)]
*  She's very eloquent. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=826.06s)]
*  And so do I think she can beat Trump? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=827.14s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=828.4599999999999s)]
*  When you have him up there talking about swinging around with sharks and windmills and Hannibal, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=829.4599999999999s)]
*  we did get the Hannibal. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=834.6999999999999s)]
*  We did get the Hannibal Lecter, yes. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=835.6999999999999s)]
*  When you have him talking about that and she's actually talking about real policy that affects [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=836.6999999999999s)]
*  Americans on an everyday basis, I think that is where you'll see her truly shine. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=840.38s)]
*  But right now, it is a Biden-Harris ticket. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=844.9399999999999s)]
*  So that is where we are right now and that's where I am on it. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=847.26s)]
*  So moving fast by the time this airs, maybe it's not a Biden-Harris ticket. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=851.06s)]
*  Sarah, do you think Joe Biden can beat Donald Trump, your former boss? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=854.02s)]
*  If you look at the polling, it does not look like at this point in the race that Joe Biden [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=859.62s)]
*  can defeat Donald Trump. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=865.22s)]
*  And I'm worried that he's not going to be able to be out there on the campaign trail [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=866.54s)]
*  and prosecute the case against Trump. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=870.4200000000001s)]
*  Look, doing obviously his team is saying that he had a bad night at the debate, but doing [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=872.94s)]
*  a couple of TV interviews isn't going to clean that mess up because the issue that voters [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=879.74s)]
*  have with him is his age, is his ability to serve another four years. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=884.42s)]
*  And you can't defeat father time. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=889.5s)]
*  And so I don't see a strategy in which that they can overturn the outcome that the polls [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=891.74s)]
*  are showing right now. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=897.5s)]
*  And right now, it looks like that Trump would beat Biden in a landslide. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=898.78s)]
*  And so for someone who truly believes that democracy is on the line in this election, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=902.78s)]
*  I really hope that Biden is taking the weekend to think about his place in history, because [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=907.38s)]
*  right now it's looking like he's going to be a one term president. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=913.14s)]
*  And so he can be a one term president who decides to go out with honor, or he can be [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=915.78s)]
*  a one term president who risks the very democracy that he swore to protect. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=920.18s)]
*  I'm not saying that he can't win. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=924.66s)]
*  I've even publicly stated that I will vote for Joe Biden in 2024. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=926.5s)]
*  The thing is, I'm a Republican and I'm talking to a lot of other fellow Republicans who are [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=932.1800000000001s)]
*  on the fence, and they're worried about his age. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=937.86s)]
*  And so I just think that when you see someone like Trump who projects strength and it appears [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=940.9000000000001s)]
*  like Joe Biden is projecting weakness, that maybe there needs to be a change in the ticket. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=946.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think that Kamala Harris, who is getting dismissed by some in the Democratic Party, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=952.34s)]
*  actually would be a formidable opponent against Trump. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=956.9000000000001s)]
*  I think the idea of a contested election, also not the worst idea ever either. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=959.78s)]
*  Imagine the media coverage that that would garner. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=964.26s)]
*  It would suck all the oxygen out of the room compared to competing against Trump, who [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=967.06s)]
*  typically is the person to do that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=971.4599999999999s)]
*  And so I think that it actually could benefit Democrats in that way. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=973.3s)]
*  And voters are just so desperate for anyone other than the two options that they are currently [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=977.3s)]
*  being presented with, that another opponent would, I think, actually have a fighting [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=982.66s)]
*  chance against Trump. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=987.3s)]
*  And I think you said contested election. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=988.58s)]
*  I'm sure you meant contested convention. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=989.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=991.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=992.74s)]
*  I don't think you want a contested election. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=993.54s)]
*  We all want to avoid that. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=995.46s)]
*  Just to end, I've interviewed you both before individually and asked you this question before, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=996.98s)]
*  but I want to ask here, especially because we're in a very different moment right now, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1001.14s)]
*  especially for our Zeteo viewers watching at home, who might look at this panel and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1003.78s)]
*  say, well, you two were part of the problem. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1007.14s)]
*  Both of you worked for Donald Trump when a lot of the rest of us were saying, you know, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1008.82s)]
*  Sarah just said you're going to vote for Joe Biden in 2024. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1012.02s)]
*  A lot of people at home are saying, well, we voted against Trump in 2016 and 2020. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1015.3s)]
*  How did you guys get it so wrong? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1019.06s)]
*  What regrets do you have? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1020.3399999999999s)]
*  Just briefly, Sarah, then Olivia. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1021.3s)]
*  I think that no matter who you work for, you're never going to agree with them 100% of the time. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1025.3799999999999s)]
*  And I knew that full well that I never went to go work for Donald Trump because I believed [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1031.3s)]
*  in the man. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1038.82s)]
*  I was there for the institution to serve the American people. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1039.46s)]
*  And because I believed in the policy, majority of the policies, I should clarify that we carried [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1042.98s)]
*  out, but I never fully supported him and his character and his rhetoric. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1048.74s)]
*  And so, sure, I have a being a spokesperson for him in particular. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1054.8200000000002s)]
*  I have regrets about the things that I defended because when you're a spokesperson for a [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1059.5400000000002s)]
*  politician, it's their name on the door. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1063.8600000000001s)]
*  And so that is your job to defend everything they say or do. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1065.8600000000001s)]
*  And so looking back on some of the things that I defended, I'm not necessarily proud of. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1069.38s)]
*  But I think that when the time came after he refused to accept the election result and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1074.66s)]
*  disrupted the peaceful transfer of power on January 6th, I broke with him and since then have [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1081.5400000000002s)]
*  been an outspoken critic and have been trying to do everything I can moving forward to ensure [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1086.5s)]
*  that Donald Trump never steps foot in the Oval Office again. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1091.94s)]
*  Yes, you have. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1094.9s)]
*  Olivia, last word. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1095.7s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, I have said this publicly and I'll say it again. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1097.46s)]
*  I don't know that you can go into the Trump administration and especially, you know, I [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1102.02s)]
*  started at DHS. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1106.1000000000001s)]
*  I lived the travel ban firsthand. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1107.14s)]
*  I had to work on the travel ban. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1108.74s)]
*  I worked on a lot of really complicated executive orders. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1109.94s)]
*  And then I went to the Trump White House, right, and I worked for Mike Pence. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1114.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't think that you can be in that situation and not be complicit in some way. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1117.78s)]
*  You're going to pick your battles. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1122.8200000000002s)]
*  You're going to figure out how to navigate it. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1123.8600000000001s)]
*  I have to tell you that towards the end when I by that point had seen so many things that [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1126.3400000000001s)]
*  I found just very hard to palette and swallow and get through, I did have conversations [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1130.9s)]
*  with myself and said, okay, I just want to quit today. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1138.1000000000001s)]
*  Today is the day that I'm done. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1142.5s)]
*  But when I saw people around me leave, there were loyalists, complete loyalists that would [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1145.0600000000002s)]
*  come in and backfill them and it was making things that much harder. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1150.42s)]
*  It was a constant conversation with myself. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1153.46s)]
*  Am I helping to push back on this or am I enabling? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1157.14s)]
*  And that was a conversation probably that I had every single day, Medi, honestly. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1159.6200000000001s)]
*  Like, and it's hard to have that moral kind of conversation with yourself. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1163.22s)]
*  And so I think, you know, I'm the cap like of doing everything I can to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1167.8600000000001s)]
*  right the wrongs in the past. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1172.58s)]
*  You know, it's unprecedented probably as well to have someone go from Vice President Mike [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1175.14s)]
*  Pence's staff to going and being on stage with Vice President Kamala Harris, who's a [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1179.7s)]
*  completely politically opposite. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1184.02s)]
*  And I know you get a lot of hate for it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1184.42s)]
*  I do. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1186.5s)]
*  And I, you know, I get it from the left. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1187.06s)]
*  I think we get it from the left and we get it from the right. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1188.26s)]
*  I'm very much getting that from the right. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1190.02s)]
*  And I will tell you, just to be very candid with you, in the past couple days, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1192.66s)]
*  I have gotten some really ugly, misogynistic, racist messages that are on a different level. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1200.1000000000001s)]
*  And so that should tell you about the dynamics in this country. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1208.82s)]
*  And, you know, what it's like to be someone coming from Mike Pence's staff to be on stage with [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1213.22s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris, who I have tremendous respect for as well. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1217.78s)]
*  And in the aftermath of what happened. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1221.1399999999999s)]
*  We'll have to leave it there. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1224.74s)]
*  Olivia, Troy, Sarah, Matthew, do stay safe and thank you for speaking out. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1225.62s)]
*  Thank you both for coming on Medi Unfiltered today. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy0z3HxEYjY&t=1229.54s)]
