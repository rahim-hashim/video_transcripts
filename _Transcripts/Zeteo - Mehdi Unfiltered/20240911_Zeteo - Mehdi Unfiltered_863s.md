# What is Project 2025 and Who Are the Billionaires Funding it?
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [September 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8)
*  If you're a subscriber to Zateo, as I know you all must be, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=0.0s)]
*  then chances are you're well aware of Project 2025. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=3.24s)]
*  Yes, the dangerous far-right policy agenda [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  that Trump is desperately trying to deny involvement with, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=8.88s)]
*  despite over 140 of his former staffers having worked on it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=11.92s)]
*  And the DNC were focused on it, too, last month in Chicago, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=15.76s)]
*  with Democrats zooming in on the bits from it [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=18.92s)]
*  that they think voters will be most concerned about, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=21.16s)]
*  like the project's plan to create backdoor abortion bans [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=23.32s)]
*  and the vast expansion of presidential powers, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  both of which are indeed major threats to our democracy and to our rights. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=29.04s)]
*  But what they're not really mentioning [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=33.04s)]
*  is how this is more than just a plan from the MAGA mastermind. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=34.64s)]
*  It's also from and for the country's ultra-rich oligarchs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=38.24s)]
*  I'm talking about people like the Koch family, the oil billionaires, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=42.6s)]
*  famous for using dark money to kill climate action time after time. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  I'm talking about the groups run by people like Leonard Leo, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=49.8s)]
*  who, with the help of billionaire donors like Harlan Crowe, Paul Singer, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  and, yes, the Koch family used his influence over Trump [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=56.24s)]
*  to create the Supreme Court's current conservative supermajority. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=60.0s)]
*  Leo and the Koch family are just a few of the big-money meddlers [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=64.2s)]
*  who have already helped funnel millions into Project 2025. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=67.32s)]
*  On top of their donations, the lever has also reported [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=70.64s)]
*  that the Heritage Foundation, aka the organisation behind Project 2025, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=73.48s)]
*  has received over $18 million from Wall Street's donor-advised funds [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=78.08s)]
*  and that number is only continuing to increase. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=83.16s)]
*  Now, whether or not all that support is the cause [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=85.96s)]
*  or the consequence of Project 2025's plan [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=89.16s)]
*  to water down campaign finance laws, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=92.12s)]
*  one thing is for sure, those dark-money oligarchs [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  are becoming more and more successful [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=97.0s)]
*  when it comes to thwarting our democracy and its rules. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=98.8s)]
*  That's exactly what former senior communications adviser [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=102.32s)]
*  and speechwriter to the Bernie Sanders campaign [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  and founder and editor-in-chief for The Lever, David Sirota, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=108.12s)]
*  exposes in his excellent new investigative podcast series, Masterplan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=111.0s)]
*  The show takes you through a decades-long scheme [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=116.16s)]
*  to effectively legalise corruption in the United States of America. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  And David Sirota joins me now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=122.88s)]
*  David, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=124.39999999999999s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=127.28s)]
*  David, when people talk about the normalisation of dark money [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=128.6s)]
*  and billionaire influence in our politics, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=131.6s)]
*  they tend to go back to the Citizens United Supreme Court decision from 2010. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=133.92s)]
*  But when you talk about all this corruption in Masterplan, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=138.56s)]
*  you go back even further. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=142.0s)]
*  Where do you start the clock when you look at the timeline [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=143.48s)]
*  of this corrupt influence on our election system? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=146.4s)]
*  The early 1970s is where all this really started. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=150.92s)]
*  There was the Watergate scandal, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  which was basically the first major campaign finance scandal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=156.24s)]
*  of the modern era. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=160.24s)]
*  I think a lot of people know about the break-in. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=161.72s)]
*  They don't know that corporate money, illegal, secret corporate money, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=163.2s)]
*  funded part of the break-in, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=167.28s)]
*  and executives were prosecuted at the time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  And after that came the post-Watergate campaign finance reforms. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  But at the same time that was happening, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=176.4s)]
*  those victories were happening, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=178.12s)]
*  there was a guy named Lewis Powell. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=179.96s)]
*  He was the head of the American Bar Association, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=181.8s)]
*  a tobacco industry lawyer, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  who wrote a memo for the Chamber of Commerce [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=186.12s)]
*  that was a directive that corporations needed to do a much better job [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=189.68s)]
*  of essentially owning the government [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=194.04000000000002s)]
*  because the government had become too democratically responsive to the public. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=195.84s)]
*  And what ended up coming out of that was a series of task forces [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  that included some of the executives of the top biggest corporations [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=205.0s)]
*  in the country. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=208.36s)]
*  And they focused on taking over the judiciary [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=209.24s)]
*  and deregulating the campaign finance system. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  So baked into the post-Watergate campaign finance reforms, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=215.4s)]
*  as one example, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=218.52s)]
*  were the loopholes that created corporate pacts in the first place, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  an explosion of corporate pacts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=223.72000000000003s)]
*  What came out of the conservative legal movement from the Powell memo [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=225.48s)]
*  was the case, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=229.72s)]
*  what was then a radical idea that money in politics isn't corruption, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=230.84s)]
*  money in politics is constitutionally protected speech, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=234.48s)]
*  the Buckley v. Valeo case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  And also what came out of that was that Lewis Powell, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=240.0s)]
*  soon after writing the memo, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=243.2s)]
*  was installed on the Supreme Court [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=244.88s)]
*  where he engineered a ruling after Buckley v. Valeo [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  which says money is not only constitutionally protected speech, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=250.32s)]
*  but corporations have a right to those free speech protections [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=253.76s)]
*  when spending in elections. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=257.8s)]
*  That decision, authored by Lewis Powell, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=259.44s)]
*  the creator of the Powell memo, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=262.0s)]
*  became the basis for Citizens United. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=264.24s)]
*  So the point is that this is a long plan [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=267.76s)]
*  implemented to focus on deregulating the campaign finance system, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=271.44s)]
*  ending the anti-corruption and anti-gribery laws. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=275.28s)]
*  And you may ask why, why would they want to do that? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=278.12s)]
*  Because in a one-person, one-vote democracy, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=280.52000000000004s)]
*  it's much harder for oligarchs and corporations [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=283.88s)]
*  to pass the unpopular self-enriching policies they want. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  They need to use the thing they have the most of, money, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  to rig that and short-circuit that process. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=294.8s)]
*  So just on the money and the short-circuiting, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=297.88s)]
*  and thank you for that summary, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  let's now look at what's happening today [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  based on what started in the 70s. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=303.6s)]
*  We have Project 2025, we have the Heritage Foundation, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=305.56s)]
*  which has got a lot of money as your news outfit, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  the lever, has reported. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=311.0s)]
*  Wall Street has donated millions to the Heritage Foundation, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=312.24s)]
*  which then gives Trump Project 2025. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=314.68s)]
*  What specifically, obviously we know generally you mentioned, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=317.68s)]
*  but what specifically is in it for Wall Street here? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  What are they going to get out of this? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=323.8s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=325.68s)]
*  I mean, there's all sorts of efforts [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=326.92s)]
*  to rescind the regulatory regime, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=329.44s)]
*  the, frankly, weak regulatory regime [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=332.88s)]
*  that exists to regulate banks and financial institutions, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=336.72s)]
*  stuff like how much money you have to keep in reserve, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  capital requirements and the like, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  how much federal regulatory oversight [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=346.76s)]
*  on what kinds of investments you're making. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=349.56s)]
*  Same thing with the SEC. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  And I should mention that this all, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=354.32s)]
*  the Project 2025 directly goes back [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=356.68s)]
*  to the same plan we're talking about. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  The Powell memo inspired the seed funding [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=361.36s)]
*  for the Heritage Foundation, the major donor, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=365.68s)]
*  a guy named Joe Kors. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=368.56s)]
*  We uncovered that, others have noted that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=370.48s)]
*  And the Heritage Foundation found its niche [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=373.68s)]
*  in creating these long detailed policy templates [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=377.48s)]
*  for Republican presidents. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=382.12s)]
*  Project 2025 is the ninth iteration of what it was called, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=384.24s)]
*  mandate for leadership. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=388.04s)]
*  And the reason to be concerned about it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=389.52s)]
*  is because when we've seen other Republican presidents [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=391.92s)]
*  come into office, they have used mandate for leadership [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=395.0s)]
*  to implement these policies. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=399.48s)]
*  This is not just like pie in the sky stuff. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=401.36s)]
*  The Project 2025 in the Mandate for Leadership series [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=404.6s)]
*  is designed to be implemented on day one. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=408.12s)]
*  And as we say, we've talked a lot about the implications [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=412.12s)]
*  for abortion rights, for the DOJ. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=414.88s)]
*  A lot of that is getting a lot of play and it should, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=418.8s)]
*  but you're one of the few people sounding the alarm saying, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=421.44s)]
*  actually, this is really going to be a gift to billionaires [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=423.48s)]
*  coming off the back of a Biden presidency, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=427.16s)]
*  which for all its many faults, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=429.88s)]
*  did a lot of good stuff on the domestic front, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=431.36s)]
*  from the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=433.68s)]
*  to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=435.84s)]
*  to the American Rescue Plan, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=437.52s)]
*  and obviously building on the Obama Affordable Care Act. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=438.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=442.0s)]
*  I mean, the Biden administration on domestic economics [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=442.84s)]
*  has been the best domestic economic policies [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=447.36s)]
*  in really 50 years. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  And look, the inflation is a serious problem, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=454.0s)]
*  but when you look at the FTC, the CFPB, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=457.56s)]
*  labor policy, the American Rescue Plan, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you may be, it's so much better [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=462.68s)]
*  than what has come in the last 50 years. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=466.08000000000004s)]
*  Now you could say, well, that's more a referendum [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  on how bad the policies have been over the last 50 years. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=471.52s)]
*  But life is relative. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=474.16s)]
*  Exactly, it's undeniable. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=475.76s)]
*  And Project 2025 is an attempt to revert all of that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=477.8s)]
*  So we've seen big money involved in our elections [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=481.32s)]
*  for many years. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=485.68s)]
*  In the most recent primary cycles, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=486.56s)]
*  we've seen AIPAC, for example, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=488.52s)]
*  the very powerful pro-Israel lobbying group [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=490.8s)]
*  managed to oust two very progressive members of Congress, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=493.4s)]
*  two critics of Israel, Jamal Bowman, Cory Bush. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=496.48s)]
*  I think they spent something like $23 million [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=498.52s)]
*  in those two races combined, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=500.88s)]
*  more than many foreign countries [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=502.28s)]
*  spend on their entire elections in these two districts. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=503.68s)]
*  What do you think the Democratic Party can do, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  should do in response to groups like AIPAC [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=509.88s)]
*  almost buying elections, some might argue? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=514.24s)]
*  It's a really difficult quandary. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=517.16s)]
*  I think first and foremost, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=518.8s)]
*  there needs to be public financing of elections. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=520.52s)]
*  Bernie Sanders mentioned this at the Democratic convention. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=522.76s)]
*  It seems like a pie in the sky idea, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=525.64s)]
*  but it is fundamental to our democracy, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=528.24s)]
*  which is to say there should be a way for people [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=530.64s)]
*  to run for office where they can have adequate resources [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=533.6s)]
*  to run a serious political campaign [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=536.8399999999999s)]
*  and adequate resources that aren't from private sources [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=539.68s)]
*  that are coming with the expectations of government favors. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=543.16s)]
*  Right now, because of the master plan, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=546.16s)]
*  the deregulated campaign finance system [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=549.52s)]
*  forces candidates to rely on private sources [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=551.64s)]
*  and allows essentially billionaires [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  and wealthy special interests to buy these elections. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=557.8399999999999s)]
*  Public financing of elections has passed in other states. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=562.3599999999999s)]
*  It's been supported by Democrats. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=564.92s)]
*  If you want to make a more level playing field, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=567.16s)]
*  it's not gonna be perfect, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=570.6s)]
*  but a more level playing field, this is essential. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=571.6s)]
*  So isn't the real evil genius of the master plan [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=574.88s)]
*  that isn't just focused on Republicans, right? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=579.2s)]
*  Corporate interests have managed to get both parties [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=582.24s)]
*  on board with their deregulatory small government agendas. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=584.36s)]
*  The Democratic Party, parts of it, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=588.12s)]
*  are also beholden to oligarchs, billionaires, big donors. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=589.8s)]
*  There was a fascinating moment, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  revealing moment at the DNC, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=595.4799999999999s)]
*  where Illinois Governor JB Pritzker took the stage [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  just before your old boss, Senator Bernie Sanders, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=599.24s)]
*  and joked about being a billionaire [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  and got huge applause from the crowd. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=603.52s)]
*  Like, billionaires are not all baddies [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  if they're hand-happened to be a Democratic governor. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=606.3599999999999s)]
*  And of course, the Democrats themselves [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=609.28s)]
*  get a lot of corporate PAC money. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=611.0s)]
*  Can the Democrats be the party then that reforms the system? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=613.52s)]
*  It's a really good question. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=617.16s)]
*  I think the answer is it's hard to really say. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=618.64s)]
*  One thing that can be said is that the Democrats [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=622.32s)]
*  have sponsored, for instance, the Disclose Act, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  which would require better disclosure of anonymous money [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=628.7600000000001s)]
*  flooding into politics. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=632.48s)]
*  It's been the Democrats who have co-sponsored [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=633.5600000000001s)]
*  bills like a public financing bill. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=636.36s)]
*  But I think it's an entirely fair question to ask, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=638.32s)]
*  can a party that is dependent as much [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=641.44s)]
*  as the Republican Party on oligarch and big money, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=646.6s)]
*  can that party, will that party really want [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=651.28s)]
*  to reform the system? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=653.88s)]
*  I would just say this, that I think it's possible, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=655.28s)]
*  but it's going to require a reform movement. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=658.28s)]
*  I think back to John McCain in 2000, a Republican, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=660.68s)]
*  where he raised this issue of corporate money [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=664.8s)]
*  and corruption in politics to such a national level [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=667.76s)]
*  that it compelled the human personification [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=670.88s)]
*  of money in politics, George W. Bush, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  to sign campaign finance reform. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  And that happened because he galvanized [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  public support for it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=679.24s)]
*  The question is, is there a similar set of leaders [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=680.6s)]
*  in the Democratic Party willing to galvanize that support [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=683.72s)]
*  for the same kind of cause? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=689.4s)]
*  Last question, we talk about the Democrats, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=691.88s)]
*  but ultimately, you know, the master plan [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=693.96s)]
*  is about the Republicans. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=696.48s)]
*  It is about right-wing billionaires. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=697.52s)]
*  Our most famous right-wing billionaire, Elon Musk, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=699.9200000000001s)]
*  is now being touted for a position in government [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=702.64s)]
*  in a future Trump administration. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=705.52s)]
*  He says he can't wait to help Donald Trump [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=707.08s)]
*  cut government spending and inefficiency and waste in 2025. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=708.76s)]
*  What does it say to you about our political moment right now [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=714.96s)]
*  that someone like Musk, who's so unashamed [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=719.32s)]
*  of his billionaires that he just buys Twitter, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=722.08s)]
*  rebrands it as X, turns it into a vehicle for the right, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=724.32s)]
*  talks openly about, you know, there's reporting [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=727.12s)]
*  he's denying it about spending money [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  on trying to elect Trump, and of course, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=731.28s)]
*  him wanting to work for Trump, which he's open about. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=733.2s)]
*  What does it say about our political moment [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=735.96s)]
*  that this guy's still seen as some sort of hero, genius, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=737.76s)]
*  someone to emulate and aspire to be in America in 2024 [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=742.4s)]
*  by vast sections of the populace? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=746.04s)]
*  Including many liberals. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=748.68s)]
*  This is the danger of normalizing corruption. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=750.56s)]
*  There's legalizing corruption, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=753.64s)]
*  where we deregulate the campaign finance laws. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  The Supreme Court says essentially bribery is legal, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=757.24s)]
*  but there's normalizing it, where we as a culture [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=760.72s)]
*  and a society say this kind of corruption, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=763.64s)]
*  where for instance, somebody like Elon Musk says [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=766.52s)]
*  he's gonna give millions of dollars to Donald Trump, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=768.48s)]
*  and then is asking for things from Donald Trump, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=770.68s)]
*  or Donald Trump is running out and saying [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=772.88s)]
*  to oil billionaires or companies, give me your money, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=774.84s)]
*  and I'll give you climate policy. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=777.76s)]
*  When we say that this is no longer corruption, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  this is just what politics is, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=783.1999999999999s)]
*  that is going to be the barrier [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=786.0799999999999s)]
*  to any kind of reform movement, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=788.36s)]
*  because it's like the David Foster Wallace speech [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=790.0799999999999s)]
*  about the fish. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=792.52s)]
*  Two fish are swimming along, one fish says, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=793.4s)]
*  hey, how do you think the water is today? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=795.32s)]
*  And the other fish says, what is water? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=796.9200000000001s)]
*  If corruption becomes the water, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=799.5200000000001s)]
*  where we don't even recognize it as anything outrageous [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=801.96s)]
*  or anything unacceptable, then it is true, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=805.4000000000001s)]
*  the master plan will win. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=808.2s)]
*  But I don't think it has to go that way. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=809.6400000000001s)]
*  Maybe I'm an eternal optimist, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=812.36s)]
*  I still think that a lot of Americans, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=814.08s)]
*  and the polls show it, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=816.6400000000001s)]
*  a lot of Americans don't think this is acceptable, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=818.08s)]
*  but they're waiting for leadership [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=820.4000000000001s)]
*  to galvanize more of a movement [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=822.24s)]
*  to say here is how it can be fixed and fought. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=825.6400000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm not an optimist, David, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=829.96s)]
*  but I am hopeful, and I stay hopeful. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWO31ttQ7n8&t=831.1600000000001s)]
