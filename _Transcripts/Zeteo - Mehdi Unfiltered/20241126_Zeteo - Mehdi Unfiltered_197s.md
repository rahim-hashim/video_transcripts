Video Description: “The moderates got their candidate in every single election in which the Republicans nominated Donald Trump … and they lost to Trump two out of three times.”

Mehdi Hasan rebuts the “demonstrably and obviously false” notion that the Democrats lost the presidential election because they ran a left-wing campaign.

“There was nothing left-wing about Harris,” Mehdi argues. She was “a tough on crime prosecutor, who bragged about owning a gun, and spoke about her love for a 'lethal' military.”

# 'There was nothing left-wing about Harris': Mehdi Hasan slams the media for blaming the Left
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8)
*  Donald Trump winning the election was bad enough, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=0.0s)]
*  but Democrats and much of our liberal media [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=2.5s)]
*  now trying to blame their defeat on the left, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=4.64s)]
*  on progressives, on wokeness, is just doing my head in. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=7.58s)]
*  Harris' defeat is a stinging verdict for the left, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=12.68s)]
*  was the headline in The Post. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=15.48s)]
*  When will Democrats learn to say no to the left, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=17.32s)]
*  was the headline in The Times. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=20.26s)]
*  A former Hillary Clinton advisor popped up on CNN [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=21.82s)]
*  to say the Democratic Party is being held hostage [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=24.26s)]
*  by the far left. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=26.76s)]
*  That's the new narrative. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=28.52s)]
*  Progressives cost Democrats the White House. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=30.02s)]
*  Kamala Harris' losing campaign was a left-wing campaign. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=32.3s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=36.66s)]
*  This is gaslighting of Trumpian proportions. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=38.9s)]
*  There was nothing left-wing about Harris. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=41.78s)]
*  I mean, the centrists literally got the presidential candidate [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=44.1s)]
*  they wanted, a tough-on-crime prosecutor [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  who bragged about owning a gun and spoke about her love [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=49.44s)]
*  for a lethal military. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=52.32s)]
*  A candidate who famously told migrants, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=54.08s)]
*  don't come to this country, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=56.279999999999994s)]
*  and during the one and only presidential debate, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=58.12s)]
*  attacked Trump for not backing a bipartisan [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=60.26s)]
*  and very draconian border security bill. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  The idea that progressives got the campaign they wanted [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=65.92s)]
*  and then lost, and so the left is now discredited, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=68.46s)]
*  is so ridiculous, so detached from reality, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=71.36s)]
*  so demonstrably and obviously false, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=74.34s)]
*  that I can't believe I'm even having to sit here [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  and rebut it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=79.14s)]
*  Oh, well, it was the wokeness then. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=80.38s)]
*  It was the cultural stuff. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=83.08s)]
*  No, Harris barely said anything about transgender rights. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=85.2s)]
*  She didn't utter the term Latinx during the campaign either, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=88.78s)]
*  nor did she ever mention the words defund the police. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=92.08000000000001s)]
*  Stop lying. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=95.22000000000001s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, the year when people were talking [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=96.98s)]
*  about defunding the police was 2020, not 2024. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=100.12s)]
*  And Democrats won in 2020, just saying. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=104.2s)]
*  Look, it's as clear as day, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  Harris did not run a left-wing campaign. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=109.4s)]
*  She didn't run on Medicare for All. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=112.06s)]
*  She didn't run on student debt relief. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=113.82s)]
*  She didn't run on a Green New Deal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=115.8s)]
*  And she didn't break with Joe Biden on Gaza. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=118.02s)]
*  So when you say she ran left, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=122.0s)]
*  what on earth are you talking about? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=124.3s)]
*  This is a presidential candidate who campaigned way more [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=127.94s)]
*  with Liz Cheney and Mark Cuban than with AOC and Sean Fain, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=130.38s)]
*  who listened more to her brother-in-law, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=134.18s)]
*  the chief legal officer of Uber, than to Bernie Sanders. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=135.88s)]
*  The truth is that in 2016, and again in 2020, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=140.12s)]
*  the Democratic establishment united to block Bernie Sanders, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  an actual leftist, from becoming their nominee. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  And in 2024, due to Joe Biden's stubbornness, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=149.86s)]
*  they didn't even have a contest, just a coronation. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=153.46s)]
*  So look, the centrists, the moderates, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  got their candidate in every single election [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=160.60000000000002s)]
*  in which the Republicans nominated Donald Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=163.60000000000002s)]
*  2016, Hillary Clinton. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=165.9s)]
*  2020, Joe Biden. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  2024, Kamala Harris. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=168.84s)]
*  And they lost to Trump two out of three times. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=170.8s)]
*  And now they're gonna blame the left for that? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=174.10000000000002s)]
*  No f***ing way. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYwKS6NfmI8&t=177.04000000000002s)]
