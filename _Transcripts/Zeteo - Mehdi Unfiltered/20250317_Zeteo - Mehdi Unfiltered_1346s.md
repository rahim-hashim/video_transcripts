Video Description: Watch Lara Friedman, President of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, join Mehdi Hasan in this episode of _‘Mehdi Unfiltered.’_ They discuss the Donald Trump administration's targeting of free speech around Gaza, how conservatives conflate anti-Zionism with antisemitism, and why Americans should not look over the things that Elon Musk and Steve Bannon are saying.

_“It's a framing that started not with this Trump administration, it was there during the Biden administration, was there during the previous Trump administration… it has almost become a cult-like fealty that is demanded to Zionism and the state of Israel.”_

# Why Conservatives HATE Liberal Jews
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU)
*  Well, folks, it's official. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=0.0s)]
*  We now know who the biggest enemy of Israel is. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=2.0s)]
*  Not Islamic extremists. No, no, no. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Check out what Donald Trump's former chief strategist, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=7.3s)]
*  Steve Bannon, MAGA darling, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=10.0s)]
*  said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=11.8s)]
*  The number one enemy to the people in Israel [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  are American Jews that do not support Israel [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=17.3s)]
*  and do not support MAGA. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=20.6s)]
*  Okay, MAGA and the evangelical Christians [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=22.0s)]
*  and the traditional Catholics in this country [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=24.3s)]
*  have Israel's back. They have the Jews' back. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=26.1s)]
*  The biggest single enemy to the Jewish people [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=28.6s)]
*  are not the Islamic supremacists. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=31.5s)]
*  The biggest enemy you have is inside the wire. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=33.5s)]
*  Outrageous, right? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=36.4s)]
*  Now, what if I told you that wasn't even [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=37.900000000000006s)]
*  the most anti-Semitic thing he seemed to do that night? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=39.900000000000006s)]
*  And we're not gonna retreat. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=42.5s)]
*  We're not gonna surrender. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=44.0s)]
*  We're not gonna quit. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=45.2s)]
*  Fight, fight, fight! [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Amen! [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=51.0s)]
*  I'm not sure what church Steve Bannon goes to, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=52.0s)]
*  but I've never seen anyone perform [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=54.900000000000006s)]
*  what looks to many like a Nazi salute [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=56.0s)]
*  and then follow it with, amen, not even Elon Musk. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=58.1s)]
*  Now, Bannon denied that what we all saw [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=61.5s)]
*  was a Nazi salute, adding, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=63.9s)]
*  I do it at the end of all my speeches to thank the crowd, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=65.4s)]
*  which frankly does not help Steve's argument. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=68.3s)]
*  But look, far-right people in the U.S. and in Europe [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=71.1s)]
*  have worked out that if you cozy up to Israel, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=73.6s)]
*  you get to avoid charges of anti-Semitism. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=75.7s)]
*  You even get to attack liberal Jews [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=77.9s)]
*  who are critical of Israel, as Bannon just did, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=79.6s)]
*  without any pushback from the ADL [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=82.1s)]
*  or any of the other major Jewish organizations, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=83.9s)]
*  almost all of whom blindly back Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=86.3s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss the way in which [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  the anti-Semitic right has become super Zionist [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  is Lara Friedman, President of the Foundation [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  for Middle East Peace and an expert on the heated debate [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=95.7s)]
*  in Congress over anti-Semitism versus anti-Zionism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=98.4s)]
*  Lara, thanks for joining me on Media 14. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=102.9s)]
*  So, a lot to unpack here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=104.0s)]
*  Just to start with Steve Bannon, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  according to Steve Bannon, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  you are the biggest enemy of Israel, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  a bigger threat than ISIS. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=111.5s)]
*  You are the enemy within the wire. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw those comments? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=114.6s)]
*  I mean, I think anybody watching those comments [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=116.7s)]
*  who has a lick of common sense was sort of flabbergasted. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=119.0s)]
*  But by the same token, it's not surprising. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=123.5s)]
*  We've seen a steady escalation in this framing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=125.2s)]
*  It's a framing that started not with this Trump administration. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=129.7s)]
*  It was there during the Biden administration. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=133.2s)]
*  It was there during the previous Trump administration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=135.2s)]
*  And it's called Jewish People Who Are Critical of Israel, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=137.4s)]
*  Who Are Insufficiently Zionist. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=140.6s)]
*  It's called us Ginos, Jew in name only. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=142.5s)]
*  Sounds kind of medical, that one. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=145.3s)]
*  It's called us Un-Jews. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=146.8s)]
*  It's called us as a Jew. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=148.2s)]
*  And it's led to groups like the Anti-Defamation League. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=150.6s)]
*  Greenblatt saying explicitly, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=154.2s)]
*  you can be Jewish and an anti-Semite. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=156.5s)]
*  And all of it really boils down to what has almost become [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=158.8s)]
*  a cult-like fealty that is demanded [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=162.3s)]
*  to Zionism in the state of Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=166.2s)]
*  And if you don't have that, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=168.7s)]
*  it feels sometimes like we're just a minute away from [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=170.9s)]
*  fatwas declaring that Jewish people who are insufficiently [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  Zionist are not Jewish. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  What the ISIS used to call takfir, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  declaring people to be non-Muslim. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=181.9s)]
*  There was a piece that was published, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=183.4s)]
*  I think in the Jerusalem Post after October 7, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=185.1s)]
*  basically saying we need to declare these Jews [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=186.6s)]
*  as not part of the global community. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  People who are critical of Israel. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=191.1s)]
*  The ADL you mentioned, the Anti-Defamation League, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=192.3s)]
*  when Musk performed what many believed was a Nazi suit, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=194.6s)]
*  Nazis praised his salute. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=197.3s)]
*  He and his supporters denied it was. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=199.5s)]
*  The ADL kind of defended him and said, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=202.1s)]
*  well, it was just an awkward gesture, not a Nazi salute. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=204.2s)]
*  When such stark gestures are met with such soft responses [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=208.1s)]
*  from people who get very outraged by every other apparent [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=211.9s)]
*  expression of anti-Semitism, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=215.8s)]
*  where does that lead the Jewish community? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=217.8s)]
*  And does that encourage people on the right [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=220.9s)]
*  to keep doing more of it? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=223.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, it clearly encourages the right to do it more. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=225.8s)]
*  I will say, I posted on X a post about Steve Bannon's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=229.1s)]
*  what clearly was a Nazi salute, and my comment was, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  you know, the people who are outraged over someone saying [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=237.6s)]
*  River to the Sea seem unbothered by this. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=240.7s)]
*  And that brought forth the biggest wave or tsunami [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=243.29999999999998s)]
*  of vitriol against me I've ever experienced, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=249.7s)]
*  which really boiled down to shut up you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  and fill in your epithets, followed by the word Jew. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=254.4s)]
*  Outright anti-Semitism, including from Jewish people, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=257.6s)]
*  I will say, essentially saying, you know, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=260.1s)]
*  anyone who is supporting Palestinian lives, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=262.8s)]
*  Palestinian rights is an enemy of the Jewish people, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=265.6s)]
*  whether they're Jewish or not. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=269.1s)]
*  And anyone who is making that, we don't, someone posted, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=270.5s)]
*  we don't know what he meant by that gesture, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=274.0s)]
*  but we know what they mean when they say [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=276.5s)]
*  River to the Sea, and that's fine. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=278.1s)]
*  So you have people like Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=281.2s)]
*  and Victor Orban, I can go down the list of people [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=283.9s)]
*  who have been accused of being anti-Semitic, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=286.2s)]
*  and they've said that the go-to move, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=288.2s)]
*  and you should say this is not new, at least last decade, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=290.4s)]
*  the go-to move is, I can't be anti-Semitic, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=293.0s)]
*  I'm super pro-Israel. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=295.4s)]
*  That seems to have permeated across the political spectrum. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  People seem to buy that connection. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=300.0s)]
*  How do you disconnect? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=302.0s)]
*  How do you remind people that actually you can be [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=304.4s)]
*  super pro-Israel and still anti-Semitic? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=306.8s)]
*  Liking this video? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=309.3s)]
*  Then don't just watch, hit like, share, and subscribe, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=310.7s)]
*  and tap the bell so you never miss a video or live show. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=313.6s)]
*  But if you want early access to exclusive content, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=316.7s)]
*  then you have to head to Zateo.com and subscribe now. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=319.3s)]
*  You'll be supporting fearless, independent journalism. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=322.9s)]
*  So I actually question how much it's permeated [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=325.8s)]
*  across the body politic. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=328.0s)]
*  I think even before October 7th, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=329.8s)]
*  there was a frustration amongst many people [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=331.8s)]
*  who can think for themselves, who say, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=336.7s)]
*  I'm not anti-Semitic, I don't have any animus [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=339.0s)]
*  against the Jewish people, but I object to what Israel's doing. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=341.3s)]
*  I think post October 7th, you look at polls, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  I think it's clear that that is even bigger, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=346.8s)]
*  and that is across the political spectrum. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=349.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the concerns I think of people on the right, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=351.09999999999997s)]
*  if you're on social media, if you follow right-wing social media, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=353.4s)]
*  which I do, there is growing criticism of Israel [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=355.9s)]
*  on right-wing social media. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, influencers who, you know, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=360.9s)]
*  whether it's because they are dogmatically xenophobic [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  or don't like foreign aid or whatever, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=366.0s)]
*  they're increasingly critical. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=368.09999999999997s)]
*  But for the political class, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=369.90000000000003s)]
*  and that's really what we're talking about today, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=372.2s)]
*  you mentioned Congress at the beginning, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=374.0s)]
*  I mean, it takes us where we are today, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  where you have, we're gonna have a hearing next week [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=378.40000000000003s)]
*  in the Senate on anti-Semitism. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=380.8s)]
*  This is a Republican convened hearing. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=382.90000000000003s)]
*  We have no idea who's gonna be testifying. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=386.1s)]
*  But the framing around this is we're finally gonna have [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=388.7s)]
*  the first hearing on anti-Semitism, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=391.1s)]
*  as opposed to the hearing that they had last year [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=392.90000000000003s)]
*  in the Senate Judiciary Committee, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=395.3s)]
*  which was about anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, and hate, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=396.8s)]
*  and the anti-Semitism that the Jewish Republicans [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=400.59999999999997s)]
*  are very unhappy about, which really turned into [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=402.4s)]
*  a hate crime against the one Arab American, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=404.8s)]
*  Muslim American on the panel because of Israel. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  And I assume the Senate hearing [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=411.9s)]
*  and everything the Republican Party does on this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=413.2s)]
*  is related to Israel. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=414.7s)]
*  They're not actually interested in interrogating [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=415.8s)]
*  the anti-Semites in their midst, right? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=417.4s)]
*  That's clear. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=419.4s)]
*  Far-right white supremacists who pose a massive threat. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=420.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=422.4s)]
*  Sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind, Laura. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=423.3s)]
*  You tell me, as someone who is Jewish, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  knows the community well, knows this topic well, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=426.9s)]
*  and I've had very good Jewish friends, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=430.5s)]
*  former colleagues of mine telling me [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=432.90000000000003s)]
*  that they've never felt as unsafe as they felt. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=434.5s)]
*  And I keep saying, it's not that I disrespect [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=437.1s)]
*  anyone's feelings, people's feelings are legitimate, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  and clearly, you know, there have been anti-Semitic attacks [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=441.70000000000005s)]
*  in the last couple of years. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=444.3s)]
*  But I'm also not a goldfish. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=445.90000000000003s)]
*  I have a memory longer than eight seconds. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=447.70000000000005s)]
*  And during the Trump administration, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  multiple synagogues were attacked. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=452.1s)]
*  One synagogue was attacked, and there was a massacre there [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=454.1s)]
*  that was, I believe, the biggest killing of Jews [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  in Pennsylvania. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  Both attackers in both synagogues [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=460.40000000000003s)]
*  were far-right white supremacists. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=462.3s)]
*  They were not left-wing anti-Zionists. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=463.6s)]
*  And yet, I don't hear about that anymore. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=465.20000000000005s)]
*  It's almost been memory-holed as if [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=466.40000000000003s)]
*  that isn't the real physical threat to Jewish Americans. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=467.8s)]
*  That's been memory-holed. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=470.40000000000003s)]
*  Also, it's been memory-holed since October 7th. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=471.40000000000003s)]
*  Actual physical attacks in the U.S. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=474.6s)]
*  We've had the one person killed in an attack [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=476.3s)]
*  related to October 7th in the U.S. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=478.8s)]
*  Small Palestinian child. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=480.90000000000003s)]
*  We had a shooting against Palestinian students [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=482.70000000000005s)]
*  that left a young man paralyzed for life. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=484.70000000000005s)]
*  The challenge here is to... [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=488.8s)]
*  There's basically no gray area allowed. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=491.20000000000005s)]
*  Someone like me would like to open a conversation [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=494.1s)]
*  about the challenge of engaging a Jewish community [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  that is genuinely feeling a sense of unease, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=500.6s)]
*  lack of security, concern for the future, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=505.3s)]
*  some of which is based on very real trends. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=507.6s)]
*  Much of those trends coming, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  most of those trends coming from the far-right, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=511.3s)]
*  but also related to what they see happening in Israel. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=513.4s)]
*  And how do you speak with empathy to those fears? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=516.1s)]
*  While also saying the reality, which is, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=520.4s)]
*  Jews in America are not under attack by Hamas. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=522.9s)]
*  That's just not reality. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=526.3s)]
*  And there is an ecosystem of organizations and influencers [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=527.9s)]
*  who want to say, you have to think of it that way. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=532.0s)]
*  And it's worked. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=535.0s)]
*  I mean, I know I have friends and family [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=536.3s)]
*  who are genuinely fearful that, you know, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=538.7s)]
*  Hamas is gonna blow up their synagogue. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=540.6s)]
*  Meanwhile, the actual people who pose a threat to the synagogue [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=543.0s)]
*  are being incited, encouraged, amplified [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=545.4s)]
*  by the President of the United States. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=548.0s)]
*  Yes, and on top of that, the people that they want to see, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=549.6s)]
*  the people that they are afraid of [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=553.8s)]
*  are not the right-wingers who blew up, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=555.1999999999999s)]
*  who attacked a synagogue in Pittsburgh. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=557.8s)]
*  The people they're afraid of are the people [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=560.1s)]
*  who are trying to speak out for Palestinian lives and rights, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=561.9s)]
*  who are arguably the most vulnerable, Palestinians, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=564.9s)]
*  vulnerable people on the planet right now. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=568.1s)]
*  And people trying to defend their lives [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=570.0s)]
*  are arguably in the United States right now, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=571.9s)]
*  one of the most vulnerable categories of people [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=573.7s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=576.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, you have an Elon Musk [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=578.0s)]
*  who says a blatantly anti-Semitic thing, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=580.0s)]
*  says you are correct to a man who says [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=583.5s)]
*  that Jews are trying to replace the white population [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=585.1s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=587.1s)]
*  He gets attacked for it. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  The one time the Haiti hell comes out and criticizes him, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=589.4000000000001s)]
*  what does he do? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=591.6s)]
*  He goes to Auschwitz with Ben Shapiro, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=592.3000000000001s)]
*  but he also goes straight to Israel to meet with Netanyahu. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=594.3000000000001s)]
*  And he gets invited by Netanyahu to sit in the gallery [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=596.5s)]
*  doing Netanyahu's speech. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  There is this sense that you can go wash off [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=600.4s)]
*  the accusations of anti-Semitism [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=603.9s)]
*  by being as pro-Israel as possible. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=605.1s)]
*  Christian evangelicals have done it over the years, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  the Jerry Falwells and others who have been accused [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=609.4s)]
*  at different times. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=612.4s)]
*  This is a concerted strategy. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=614.1999999999999s)]
*  This is not accidental. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=616.3s)]
*  It's a concerted strategy, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=617.6999999999999s)]
*  and it's been going on for a long time. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=618.6999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think the CPAC event, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=620.6s)]
*  the events at CPAC this year got a lot of attention. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=622.8s)]
*  I think people probably are less, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=625.1s)]
*  have paid less attention to the fact that recent CPACs have, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=627.1s)]
*  I mean, we had the CPAC just a couple years ago [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=630.0s)]
*  where there was the Nazi symbol of the stage. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=632.2s)]
*  Oh, we didn't mean it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=634.5s)]
*  That was an accidental Nazi symbol. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=635.4s)]
*  But even going further, you can look at Hungary. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=637.7s)]
*  I mean, CPAC has an event in Hungary every year [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=640.1s)]
*  where a lot of the same people [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=643.3s)]
*  who are now leading these policies in the U.S. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=644.6s)]
*  have been going for years, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=647.0s)]
*  standing shoulder to shoulder with Israeli right-wingers, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=648.1s)]
*  Israeli illiberals, and making common cause. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=651.0s)]
*  I think what we're seeing laundered [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=654.3s)]
*  isn't merely anti-Semitism. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=655.6s)]
*  What we're seeing laundered here is illiberalism. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=657.7s)]
*  And you have a confluence of illiberals. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=659.8s)]
*  So you have an Israeli body. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  But the irony is that Jews in the West [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=664.3s)]
*  have been at the forefront of liberalism [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=666.9s)]
*  because Jews have suffered most at the hands of illiberalism. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=669.0999999999999s)]
*  They have. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=672.0999999999999s)]
*  There seems to have been a logical shift, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=672.9s)]
*  which for me, from my own analysis, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=676.0s)]
*  started in the first Trump era, really. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=677.9s)]
*  But I'm sure it started sooner with, even with Reagan, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=679.6999999999999s)]
*  with the beginning of the cozying up to the evangelicals. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=681.9s)]
*  But essentially, there seems to have been a shift in thinking [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  amongst many Israelis and Israeli leaders [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=688.1s)]
*  and increasingly American Jewish leaders [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=690.3s)]
*  or people who say they speak for Jewish Americans, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=692.6s)]
*  which says, this time, illiberalism, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=695.0s)]
*  this time, fascism is going to be good for us. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=698.0s)]
*  And we're willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with that. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=701.7s)]
*  I mean, it helps that the Israeli government itself [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=703.3s)]
*  is pretty fascistic. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=705.0s)]
*  And that's the country that's being defended abroad [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=705.9s)]
*  by the diaspora, like it or not. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=707.9s)]
*  You mentioned Hungary. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=709.9s)]
*  That's a classic example where there were some [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=711.0s)]
*  in the local Hungarian Jewish community [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=713.4s)]
*  who were pretty worried about Orban at the beginning. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=714.7s)]
*  But the Israeli government gave him the seal of approval. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=717.7s)]
*  Netanyahu and Netanyahu's son and Netanyahu's ministers [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=719.9000000000001s)]
*  said, this guy's a good guy. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=722.6s)]
*  He's not anti-Semitic. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=723.7s)]
*  And they gave him the get out of jail free card, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=724.5s)]
*  just like Netanyahu gave it to Trump in term one. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=726.4000000000001s)]
*  And it's a two-way street, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=728.9000000000001s)]
*  So it's not just that right-wingers are cozying up to Israel [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=730.8000000000001s)]
*  to avoid the anti-Semitic charge. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=734.5s)]
*  Israel is saying, you know what? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=736.3000000000001s)]
*  We're going to give these people a pass [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=737.7s)]
*  because they are useful to us in our struggle [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=739.1s)]
*  against the Palestinians. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=741.2s)]
*  You have right now, just recently, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=742.6s)]
*  the Israeli foreign ministry opened a dialogue [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=744.0s)]
*  with the three main far-right parties in France, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=746.1s)]
*  Sweden, and Spain. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=748.4s)]
*  The National Rally in France, led by Marine Le Pen, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=749.4s)]
*  the Sweden Democrats, and the Spanish Vox Party. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=751.7s)]
*  Till now, at least publicly, they wouldn't go [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=754.4s)]
*  near these parties, even the Israeli right-wing government. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=756.6s)]
*  They'd have meetings with them, but now they're saying, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=759.0s)]
*  yeah, it's fine. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=761.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we seem to have crossed the threshold. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=762.6s)]
*  And there was a moment on social media recently [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  that, for me, was really telling. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=767.4s)]
*  You know, for years, Jewish Americans [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=770.1s)]
*  grew up with this phrase, never again, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=772.3000000000001s)]
*  And this is the guiding motto of the ADL. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=775.2s)]
*  I will say, as a Jewish American raised in the States, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=778.4s)]
*  my understanding of never again was always, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=781.1s)]
*  never again to anyone. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=783.4s)]
*  We are the light into the nations. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  We've learned from our experience, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=786.1s)]
*  the experience of World War II, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=787.5s)]
*  we will never permit this to happen to anyone ever again. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  And that is the basis of, you know, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=791.4s)]
*  international law and all of that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=793.4s)]
*  And what we're seeing now, and this came out, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=795.3000000000001s)]
*  there was a debate on social media about this recently, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=797.0s)]
*  is a framing which says, how dare you, progressives, steal, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=799.9s)]
*  how dare you try to hijack this phrase. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=804.0s)]
*  It was never meant as never again for anyone. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=806.3s)]
*  It was always meant as never again to us. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=809.0s)]
*  And in the service of never again to us, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=811.9s)]
*  whatever means are necessary. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=814.0s)]
*  We have no obligation to the world. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=815.3s)]
*  What's so ironic that even if you take that narrow view, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=816.5s)]
*  which you don't and I don't and many others don't, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=819.2s)]
*  even if you take that narrow view of never again to the Jews, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=821.6s)]
*  this is not good for the Jews when the AFD, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=824.9s)]
*  a Nazi-aligned party, is doing well in Germany. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=828.0s)]
*  That is not good for the Jews, I would argue, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=830.2s)]
*  when a far-right party is doing well in Germany. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=832.0s)]
*  I would also argue, I mean, what's not good for the Jews, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=834.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, Steve Bannon, I mean, I think, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=836.8s)]
*  I saw people sort of dismissing this. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=838.8s)]
*  And for people, if you dismiss Steve Bannon, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=840.5s)]
*  you haven't been paying attention [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=842.5s)]
*  to the arc of politics for many years. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=843.8s)]
*  This is to listen to people when they tell you who they are [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=845.5s)]
*  and listen to the people who shape the narrative [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=847.9s)]
*  of the people in charge. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=850.0s)]
*  But just, you know, what Steve Bannon said at CPAC, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=851.0s)]
*  effectively, wasn't merely that Jews, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=854.1999999999999s)]
*  and he's referring to Jews in Israel, too, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=857.0s)]
*  the progressive Jews, the problem. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=859.1s)]
*  He's basically saying that the 80% of Jewish Americans [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=861.2s)]
*  who are not pro-MAGA and who are not pro-BB are the problem. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=865.4s)]
*  He isn't merely talking about the Jewish students [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=869.6s)]
*  who are out in the streets with Palestinians [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=872.3000000000001s)]
*  or Palestinian rights. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=874.4s)]
*  He's not just talking about JVP, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=875.5s)]
*  he's talking about 80% of Jewish Americans. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=877.2s)]
*  And if people, because they are right because of fear [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=880.4s)]
*  or because you've somehow, maybe it's easier, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=884.8000000000001s)]
*  if I buy into this simplistic framing of anti-Semitism, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=887.1s)]
*  equals all the things that I'm uncomfortable with, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=891.0s)]
*  this is where it takes you. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=893.5s)]
*  And if you're not gonna sign onto the MAGA agenda, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=894.9s)]
*  then they're basically saying you are an enemy of the people. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=898.1s)]
*  That's the framing here. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=901.8s)]
*  It's also amazing how he gets away with rhetoric [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=903.0s)]
*  that no one else could get away with. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=904.7s)]
*  The idea that, you know, if I rightly would have been run out [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=906.3s)]
*  of MSNBC or anywhere else mainstream, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=908.7s)]
*  that if I had said Jewish billionaires, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=910.3s)]
*  they're controlling everything. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=912.3s)]
*  That's what he says in that clip. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=913.1s)]
*  He specifically goes after Jewish billionaires [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=914.1s)]
*  because Soros is their great boogeyman. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=916.0s)]
*  You talk about 80% of American Jews. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=918.6s)]
*  Are 80% of American Jews, liberal Jews, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=920.6s)]
*  aware of how much MAGA hates them [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=923.0s)]
*  and says they are the enemy? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=925.3000000000001s)]
*  I wonder, is the average Jewish American viewer [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=926.5s)]
*  watching this, who's not watching this show, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=928.7s)]
*  who's not minding their own business, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=930.7s)]
*  do they know that one of the most influential [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=932.1s)]
*  conservatives in America said [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=933.9s)]
*  that they are the enemy within the wire? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=935.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=937.3000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if it would get through. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=938.1s)]
*  I mean, the framing in here, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=939.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't mean to always come back to the ADL, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=940.9s)]
*  but this powerful framing of, you know, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=942.5s)]
*  don't get distracted by the small things. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  Everybody who is against Israel [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=948.3000000000001s)]
*  is part of the real enemy. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=950.0s)]
*  I mean, we've now seen this for years. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=951.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter what you said before. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=953.7s)]
*  We know that there is real right-wing anti-Semitism. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=955.4s)]
*  It is potentially violent. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=958.3s)]
*  It is threatening. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=960.1s)]
*  It is what has attacked Jewish people in this country [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=960.8s)]
*  and is what is surging around the world. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=963.4s)]
*  But you launder it through support for Israel. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=964.7s)]
*  Not just that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=966.4s)]
*  And we're not interested in that. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=967.1s)]
*  We're going to take all of the energies [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=968.4s)]
*  around the supposed fight against anti-Semitism [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=971.6s)]
*  and we're going to point them at free speech [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=974.1s)]
*  of Americans who care about international law, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=976.4s)]
*  free speech, civil rights, or Palestinians. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=978.9s)]
*  So on that note, and you've been a keen observer of this, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=981.1s)]
*  you've been writing about this, sounding the alarm, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=984.1999999999999s)]
*  the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=987.0s)]
*  IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=989.4s)]
*  which has been pushed for a long time. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=992.0s)]
*  The Trump administration tried to institutionalize it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=993.3s)]
*  Term one, a lot of prominent Democrats [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=995.5s)]
*  support institutionalizing it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=998.1s)]
*  People like Richie Torres, John Feteman, others. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=999.6s)]
*  This IHRA definition basically equates anti-Semitism [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1002.6999999999999s)]
*  with anti-Semitism. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1005.6999999999999s)]
*  One of its definitions or examples of anti-Semitism [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1006.6s)]
*  says you cannot say Israel is a racist endeavor. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1009.4s)]
*  Harvard University has now adopted it [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1011.9s)]
*  after a recent case where two Jewish students sued them. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1013.5s)]
*  There's an irony now that if you're at Harvard, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1016.8000000000001s)]
*  you can say America is a racist endeavor, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1018.5s)]
*  but you can't say Israel is a racist endeavor. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1020.1s)]
*  And yet the IHRA in a country which [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1022.7s)]
*  claims the First Amendment, free speech, anti-cancel culture [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1024.5s)]
*  nonsense, IHRA is spreading. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1027.2s)]
*  I mean, just to make a point here, which I think [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1029.9s)]
*  is it's been missed, and maybe it's going to be, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1032.8s)]
*  maybe it's not going to matter. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1035.8s)]
*  Maybe it's overtaken by events with Trump's election. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1036.7s)]
*  So this definition actually passed the House last spring [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1039.0s)]
*  in legislation, and then it got stopped. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1041.8999999999999s)]
*  And the narrative for people who want to promote it [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1044.3999999999999s)]
*  is it was stopped by Democrats because they were giving [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1046.8999999999999s)]
*  into the progressive anti-Semitic left. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1049.3999999999999s)]
*  If you actually look at the record, and I mean, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1051.7s)]
*  I've documented this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1053.5s)]
*  You don't have to do any work. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  I saw the Jerry Nadler speech. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1054.8s)]
*  But I mean, setting aside Jerry Nadler, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1056.1s)]
*  this was stopped by Republicans. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1057.8999999999999s)]
*  The passage of this in the House unleashed a wave of opposition [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  from the center to the far right of the Republican Party. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1065.1s)]
*  That included the anti-Semites who say, we can't do this [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1067.7s)]
*  because it'll make it illegal to be anti-Semitic. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1070.2s)]
*  But it also included the whole center part of it. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1072.3s)]
*  I mean, Bill Ackman tweeted against this. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1075.8s)]
*  Elon Musk retweeted, I think, Matt Walsh [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1077.9s)]
*  tweeting against this. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1081.0s)]
*  You had in the New York Times conservative columnists [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1082.3s)]
*  against it. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1085.4s)]
*  You had a major editorial, long one in Tablet Magazine. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1085.8s)]
*  All of these came out. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1090.1s)]
*  Bhatia Angar Sargon posted, I think, a four-tweet thread [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1091.0s)]
*  opposing it, all of them basically saying variations of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1094.7s)]
*  this goes too far on free speech and this is stealth DEI. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1098.3s)]
*  And they're not wrong. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1102.0s)]
*  This is basically creating a special DEI category. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1102.7s)]
*  We're going to destroy DEI for everybody. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1105.3s)]
*  We're going to have a special category for supporters of Israel. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1107.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, the irony that this was more opposed publicly [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1111.4s)]
*  on the right from this free speech absolutists [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1116.3s)]
*  and the anti-DEI folks than by mainstream Democrats [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1118.8s)]
*  is fascinating. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1122.3s)]
*  I mean, it raises real questions about whether it will be [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1123.6s)]
*  opposed again this year now that Trump has been elected. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1125.8999999999999s)]
*  I tend to think they'll all forget that they had those positions. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1128.3s)]
*  Just one final question, Laura. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1131.6s)]
*  We often hear and I've done debates on this, but I want to hear [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1134.1s)]
*  it from you. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1136.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think our viewers would love to hear from you. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1136.5s)]
*  Why in your view make the case because supporters of Israel [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1138.5s)]
*  will say anti-Zionism, of course, it's anti-Semitic. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1142.0s)]
*  You're picking on the only Jewish state in the world. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1144.8999999999999s)]
*  Therefore, you're anti-Semitic. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1147.6s)]
*  Make the case for why in your view anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1149.1s)]
*  Look, until this before the failure of the peace process [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1153.5s)]
*  when it was still okay to criticize Israel during the peace process [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1158.5s)]
*  pre-peace process, which is before my time, there was it was the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1161.0s)]
*  same thing. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1164.4s)]
*  If you criticize Israel, you're anti-Semite. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1164.9s)]
*  We had the error of the peace process when it was okay to criticize [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1166.6s)]
*  as the peace process became non-credible, non-serious and Israel [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1169.1s)]
*  was doing things that make clear didn't want peace. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1172.5s)]
*  It became harder and harder to criticize and it became this [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1174.5s)]
*  conflation. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1177.6s)]
*  For those of us who grew up in a world of anti-Semitism Israel, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1178.9s)]
*  let's think about what it is. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1182.9s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is hatred, threats, attacks on Jews because they [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1184.1000000000001s)]
*  are Jewish. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1191.1000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, this is more or less the definition that was [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1192.0s)]
*  articulated by President Biden in his own anti-Semitism strategy [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1194.0s)]
*  when he didn't buy on to the IRA definition or anything else. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1198.1000000000001s)]
*  That is it. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1201.4s)]
*  The idea that that being that objecting to the policies and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1202.3000000000002s)]
*  actions of a sovereign state is anti-Semitic is laughable. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1207.7s)]
*  I grew up in Arizona. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1211.6999999999998s)]
*  In Arizona, we have many, many Native American tribes. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1214.0s)]
*  I was raised learning about this. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1216.8s)]
*  There was no question that if you are someone who is from a [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1218.3999999999999s)]
*  Native American tribe, your land stolen, your identity erased, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1223.1999999999998s)]
*  this is the horrible history of the U.S. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1226.6s)]
*  I would not blame somebody who lives on a reservation for saying [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1228.6s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1232.6s)]
*  is an illegitimate construct. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1233.6s)]
*  By the way, the question of what is the U.S. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1235.0s)]
*  have the manifest destiny right to exist is complicated by all of [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1237.6s)]
*  us who lived in the breakdown of the Soviet Union era. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1241.6s)]
*  Borders are not sacred. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1244.3999999999999s)]
*  The idea that there is one nation in the world, maybe two [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1245.8s)]
*  because of manifest destiny of the United States, it is absurd. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1248.6s)]
*  Every time I have this conversation with people who are [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1251.3999999999999s)]
*  saying, oh, you cannot, Israel is the one state who people have [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1254.6s)]
*  questioned its right to exist, these are the same people who [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1258.1999999999998s)]
*  have the right to exist. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1261.3999999999999s)]
*  I think that is the problem. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1262.6s)]
*  They don't believe Jordan has a right to exist. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1265.0s)]
*  We are in a moment now, post October 7, where Israel is [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1267.2s)]
*  literally redrawing the borders of the area around it, where [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1270.6s)]
*  people openly saying that maybe these states shouldn't exist. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1274.0s)]
*  Somehow, if what you go back to is that there is the Bible and [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1277.0s)]
*  the Bible is your real estate book, then there is nothing I can [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1281.0s)]
*  say that is going to make you a real estate agent. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1285.0s)]
*  I think that is the problem. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1288.0s)]
*  If you say, well, but the Holocaust, I will remind you that [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1291.0s)]
*  Obama was accused of being a rank anti-Semite for saying that [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1295.0s)]
*  the Holocaust justified Israel's existence. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1299.0s)]
*  Israel is a state. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1301.0s)]
*  It should be open to criticism like any other state. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1303.0s)]
*  The fact that it is not speaks to a deeper problem in our [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1306.0s)]
*  narrative. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1309.0s)]
*  Interesting you said borders are not sacred. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1310.0s)]
*  Donald Trump said that recently. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1313.0s)]
*  Laura Freeman, thank you so much for your time and analysis. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1316.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1320.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX8RoCzQYDU&t=1321.0s)]
