Video Description: “The people who have power in today's society and economy often don't hold positions in government. They hold positions in the private sector and still manage to have a ton of power. And, you know, if it becomes a lot easier for people like that to sue the media and to make threats against the media and against members of the public — that is going to have a real chilling effect, and the ability of journalists and others to speak freely and to to dig into the affairs of these people.”

Investigative journalist David Enrich joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss how he received threats while writing a book about conservatives campaigning to dismantle libel law, intimidation tactics targeted towards journalists, free speech rights and the chilling effect it has created on news organizations across the U.S.

# How Trump SECRETLY Plans to Crackdown on Free Speech
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI)
*  Less than two months into Donald Trump's second term, we've already seen the president call for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=0.0s)]
*  the firing of multiple journalists, for the revocation of broadcasting licenses from [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  outlets he doesn't like, and the banning from official White House events of one of the largest [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=8.8s)]
*  news organizations in the US, the Associated Press. Trump-appointed FCC chair Brendan Carr [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  has launched investigations into NPR and PBS. He's also investigating CBS News over the 2024 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=19.04s)]
*  60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. That interview with the then vice president also [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=25.36s)]
*  resulted in a ridiculous $10 billion lawsuit by Trump, a case in which CBS might be about to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=29.92s)]
*  settle with Trump. It's not just CBS News either. Trump is using lawsuits to intimidate multiple [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=35.52s)]
*  media organizations. Last year, ABC News paid Trump $15 million as part of a settlement of another [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=41.2s)]
*  ridiculous defamation lawsuit he brought against them for saying what a judge said about his sexual [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=47.52s)]
*  abuse case. A defamation suit they could have defeated in court. Trump has also floated, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=52.4s)]
*  passing a nice new law to curb what he calls defamatory fiction. On Truth Social in late [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  February, the president lambasted anonymous sources and off-the-record quotes saying he would sue [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=63.04s)]
*  dishonest authors and book publishers. And it's not just Trump. Elon Musk, the co-president, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=68.48s)]
*  has threatened to sue people who think he did a Nazi salute. The free speech absolutist already [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=74.48s)]
*  last year hit liberal group Media Matters for America with a defamation suit. Now, a new book [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=78.88s)]
*  is laying bare these efforts to dismantle our libel laws and the chilling effect that these [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=84.56s)]
*  libel cases are having on journalists, news organizations, and on our right to free speech. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=89.19999999999999s)]
*  The book is called Murder the Truth, Fear the First Amendment and a Secret Campaign to Protect [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=94.24s)]
*  the Powerful. It's written by David Enrich, the business investigations editor at the New York [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=100.0s)]
*  Times, and he joins me now. David, thanks so much for coming on the show. Congratulations on the new [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=104.8s)]
*  book. Murder the Truth. It's a provocative title. What does it refer to? What is the basic thesis of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=109.28s)]
*  your book? The basic thesis is that there is a long-running, but until now secret campaign [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=116.0s)]
*  by a small group of conservative lawyers, activists, judges, and politicians to basically [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=123.44s)]
*  make it much easier for people in positions of power and with a lot of money to prevent [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=129.28s)]
*  journalists and others from revealing secrets about them, revealing their wrongdoing, and just [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=134.08s)]
*  kind of speaking truth to power. And this is a campaign, as I said, that's been going on for a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=140.48000000000002s)]
*  long time, but it's recently been gaining a lot of momentum. And now with Trump and the White House, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=144.08s)]
*  I mean, you just ticked off a whole litany of things the White House has done just in the first [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  two months. And I think it's a kind of a warning sign of where things might go from here. And so [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  the book tells the story essentially of how we got here and brings you inside this campaign [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  until now. It's been occurring mostly in secret. Much of your book centers around the Supreme [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  Court's 1964 decision in New York Times versus Sullivan, which protected the freedom of the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=169.52s)]
*  press to report on public officials, to criticize public officials. The ruling meant that in order [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=174.72s)]
*  to sue journalists and news organizations for defamation, the plaintiffs, the public figures, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=179.68s)]
*  had to prove that the material was published with actual malice. That was the standard. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=185.36s)]
*  As recently as last month, though, as you know, David, we saw billionaire Steve Wynn, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Republican donor, donated $800,000 to the Trump campaign, filing a petition urging the Supreme [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=194.56s)]
*  Court to overturn Times versus Sullivan. Do you believe we will see a case threatening Sullivan, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=200.88000000000002s)]
*  threatening the precedent set by Sullivan in the Supreme Court in Trump's second term? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=208.4s)]
*  David Kramer I certainly think there are going to be a lot of people trying. And we've already seen [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=213.28s)]
*  Steve Wynn. Trump himself is trying to make arguments to have one of his pending libel suits [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=218.08s)]
*  eventually maybe make it up to the Supreme Court to overturn Sullivan. And look, I don't know what [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  the outcome of these cases will be or whether the Supreme Court will even accept any of them. I think [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=229.12s)]
*  a more likely outcome, at least in the short term, is that the Supreme Court kind of narrows the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=232.88000000000002s)]
*  scope of Sullivan in a way that would make it a lot easier for powerful public figures like a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=237.84s)]
*  billionaire or a celebrity or like a local university president to bring and win lawsuits [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=242.8s)]
*  against the media and to threaten the media and maybe a little less likely for the standards to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=248.72s)]
*  change for people who actually are like elected leaders in government. But either way, the chilling [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  effect of that would be real. I mean, the people who have power in today's society and economy [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=258.72s)]
*  often don't hold positions in government. They hold positions in the private sector and still [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=264.24s)]
*  manage to have a ton of power. And if it becomes a lot easier for people like that to sue the media [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=268.8s)]
*  and to make threats against the media and against members of the public, that is going to have a [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=275.2s)]
*  real chilling effect on the ability of journalists and others to speak freely and to dig into the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=280.08s)]
*  affairs of these people. And I think that'll be a real blow to democracy and freedom of speech. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  Very much so. And you mentioned billionaires. Steve Wynn is a billionaire. Elon Musk is a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=293.76s)]
*  billionaire. Peter Thiel, who famously shut down Gorka with a lawsuit, is a billionaire. Donald [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=298.56s)]
*  Trump is a pretend billionaire. How much of this is billionaires driving it? It's very rich people, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=303.44s)]
*  separate to ideology or right-wing politicians. It's just rich folks who don't want people like [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=309.36s)]
*  you, the business investigations editor at the Times, in their business. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=314.32s)]
*  Well, I think it is generally rich people. And obviously there's, you know, it's not coincidental [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=323.36s)]
*  that a lot of the richest people in the world are on either on or moving toward the right. But one [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=341.04s)]
*  of the things I saw in this book and that I tried to document and tell the stories about is that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=347.04s)]
*  this is not just something happening against the New York Times or CNN or the Washington Post. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=350.88s)]
*  This is something that's happening on a local level as well. And so you have a lot of local [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=356.88s)]
*  journalists who have been under intense pressure to kind of pull punches as they write about people [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  of either local or national importance. And you know, one of the real, there are a lot of problems [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=366.08s)]
*  in the media today. One of the bright spots, I think, is the arrival of so many independent voices [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=370.4s)]
*  on independent platforms, whether it's Substack or things like this, or maybe people have a podcast. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=375.84s)]
*  And it's people like that in general who are most susceptible to these threats and these legal [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=381.04s)]
*  tactics, because, you know, they generally, obviously there's some exceptions, but in general, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=386.08s)]
*  they're much less likely to have the finances to weigh into protracted legal war. They're much less [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=389.68s)]
*  likely to have the wherewithal to get good lawyers. And frankly, from just kind of a self-sustainability [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=394.88s)]
*  standpoint, and from a rational standpoint, it often makes sense when you're under threat or [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=401.44s)]
*  under litigation to kind of pull back if you don't have the resources to fight rather than be pushed [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=405.76s)]
*  rather than be driven out of business. And so I think it really poses an existential threat to a [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=411.6s)]
*  lot of the kind of citizen journalism and independent journalism we've seen in recent years. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=416.24s)]
*  I mean, someone like Musk doesn't have to win, right? He just has to drag you through the courts, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=420.56s)]
*  because he can afford to go all the way. And as you say, a smaller organization or even a bigger [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=424.72s)]
*  organization might not be able to match that financial firepower. You note in the book that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=429.04s)]
*  loose saliva laws could hurt people like Donald Trump. After all, a jury awarded columnist, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll, $83 million in damages after Trump defamed her. How might, I mean, have the [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=438.88s)]
*  people who are fighting to get rid of this stuff thought through how it might affect them, how it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=445.84s)]
*  might backfire on them? I don't think they have really thought it through. And you know, the great [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=450.0s)]
*  thing about the First Amendment is that it protects everyone's voice, not just voices on the left or [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=455.12s)]
*  the right or people you disagree with or agree with. And I think one of the things we've seen, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=459.36s)]
*  look, the existing libel laws and existing interpretation of the First Amendment, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=464.48s)]
*  if you lie or being reckless about what you're writing, you can be sued regardless of who you're [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=468.4s)]
*  writing about. So right now is plenty of recourse for people who are defamed and smeared by liars, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=473.92s)]
*  especially on the right, to seek legal recourse. The problem is that, you know, it's a blurry line. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=479.76s)]
*  And I think a lot of right-wing media has been kind of jumping on this anti-Sullivan, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=485.68s)]
*  anti-free press bandwagon. And the fact of the matter is they are among the most vulnerable [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=490.96s)]
*  people to these lawsuits. And so it is, there's a dose of hypocrisy. There's a dose of maybe just [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=494.88s)]
*  not having thought this through all the way, but there's a lot of tension between the arguments [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=502.4s)]
*  that some of these people are making and their own self-interest. Because again, the First Amendment [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=507.12s)]
*  is not about left or right, big or small. It's about protecting everyone's right to express [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  their views freely. I keep thinking about what will happen to Fox News if Sullivan goes. I could [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=515.04s)]
*  think of about 50 people off the top of my head who could sue Fox for being defamed and slandered [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=520.0s)]
*  by multiple primetime hosts on a nightly basis. I mean, Tucker Carlson's gone, but there's still [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=524.8s)]
*  a bunch of other primetime hosts who love to attack people viciously, personally, lie about people. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=529.12s)]
*  If I'm Rupert Murdoch, I do not want to lose the protections of Sullivan. Do you think Rupert [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=535.04s)]
*  Murdoch might be having a quiet word behind the scenes with his fellow billionaires saying, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=538.72s)]
*  this will screw Fox? It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, I just want to emphasize, though, that even [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=542.24s)]
*  with the existing... Even with Sullivan, we can sue, you can sue Fox for lying. And in fact, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=548.08s)]
*  that's happened. And there have been repeated cases in recent years where Fox has been successfully [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=553.2s)]
*  sued for defaming people by spreading lies. And so, yeah, but I do think in general, there is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=557.9200000000001s)]
*  not much similarity between the lies being spread on the right. And you can argue with the accuracy [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=565.36s)]
*  of some things that are said in the mainstream media or on the left, but it is disproportionately [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=571.2800000000001s)]
*  conservative media and right wing figures who are really, I think, deliberately engaging in lies [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=576.4s)]
*  and spreading conspiracy theories. And that goes right up to the White House right now. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=584.48s)]
*  And I think that's part of the reason that people like Trump and his allies are so eager to make it [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=588.16s)]
*  easier to sue the media, because the media right now, again, we're not perfect, but in general, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=593.68s)]
*  we're trying, a lot of us anyway, are trying to refute lies and distortions and disinformation. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=598.72s)]
*  Isn't the problem though, David, you're saying even now you can sue people and we got the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=604.88s)]
*  Dominion case as a classic with Fox. But isn't the real problem right now that even if a journalist [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=607.68s)]
*  ends up winning a lawsuit, or forget a journalist, a private figure ends up winning a lawsuit, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=612.56s)]
*  they will have been maybe bankrupted along the way, they may have had their reputations [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=618.24s)]
*  further tarnished as part of that lawsuit, they've now got a kind of target on their back. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=622.56s)]
*  Like it's a lot of work to go after someone. And I just wonder, or even defend them both ways. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=627.12s)]
*  It's quite hard. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=634.08s)]
*  Yeah. To me, that's not a problem of Sullivan. That's a problem with the kind of online media [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=634.72s)]
*  ecosystem that we currently have, in particular social media, where there are not only that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  people are allowed to lie and that there's no legal records, it's much more that in certain [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  social media networks in particular, have kind of juiced the algorithm so that it encourages lying [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=652.32s)]
*  and amplifies lie and encourages people to make the most outlandish statements possible, even when [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  they're divorced from the truth, it encourages people to kind of act as a mob, and sometimes [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=663.92s)]
*  kind of a borderline violent mob. And to me, so, and I think that's obviously a really serious [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=669.52s)]
*  problem. But I think it's kind of divorced from this, from the debate about the kind of interpretation [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=674.7199999999999s)]
*  of the First Amendment, because again, right now, there's nothing about the interpretation [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=680.24s)]
*  of the First Amendment in terms of libel law anyway, that prevents you if you are the victim [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=685.28s)]
*  of lies and deliberate falsehoods from filing lawsuits and collecting damages, as long as you [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=690.24s)]
*  can prove that your reputations aren't. One last question. When you have ABC News settling [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=695.92s)]
*  with Donald Trump, first of all, were you surprised to see them settle over George [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=701.52s)]
*  Stantonopoulos' comments, given how strong their legal standing was? He was literally quoting the [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=705.04s)]
*  judge. I was absolutely stunned. And do you think that, and maybe CBS News also settling, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=709.36s)]
*  there's reports that it could happen any day now, because they want to have this merger between [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=717.2s)]
*  Paramount that owns CBS and Skydance Studios, they don't want to upset the Trump administration, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  a lot of reporting about the bosses, corporate bosses putting pressure on the news folks to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=725.2s)]
*  get ready for a settlement. If CBS News settle, an even more ridiculous lawsuit, which is about the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=729.36s)]
*  editing of a Kamala Harris interview, something I've never heard in my life, a politician suing [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  a news organization because he doesn't like the way they edited an interview with his rival. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  If they settle out, where does that leave the media? Because in a sense, these are precedents, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=743.04s)]
*  right? Everyone else is going to say, Oh, ABC settled and CBS settled. Therefore, we all have to [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  bend the knee on this issue. Well, I think two things. One is that I think there's no question [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=753.04s)]
*  that settlements or even the talk of settlements is already emboldening Trump and people in his [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=760.3199999999999s)]
*  orbit. I think they are likely to seize on these successes and use them as kind of ammunition to [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=765.68s)]
*  file a lot more lawsuits and at least make a lot more threats against journalists of all [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=771.6s)]
*  different shapes and sizes and varieties, whether they're big national outlets or smaller [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=775.84s)]
*  people, maybe people who just exist on social media. That's the one thing too, is that to me, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=780.24s)]
*  the bigger concern than ABC or CBS settling lawsuits is if people in those newsrooms and [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=785.36s)]
*  other news outlets start to feel that as a result of that legal pressure and the pressure to settle [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=790.96s)]
*  these cases, they start censoring themselves and pulling punches and being just so conservative. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=795.44s)]
*  I don't mean ideologically conservative, but so kind of gun shy about calling out lies and doing [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  aggressive investigations to people in positions of power. I think that is really problematic and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=807.84s)]
*  it really contravenes the entire notion of what the first amendment is supposed to prevent and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=812.48s)]
*  what the framers of the constitution wanted. And I think it's still really important, which is having [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=817.2800000000001s)]
*  a vigorous independent news media that is not so scared of litigation that they will refuse to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=821.44s)]
*  challenge the sitting president and other people of that stature. Well, I know for a fact that a [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=827.6800000000001s)]
*  lot of media organizations were very nervous about describing Elon Musk's salute as anything [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=832.72s)]
*  other than a straight-arm gesture because they were worried that he might sue them. In fact, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=837.12s)]
*  you had Scott Jennings on CNN telling a fellow panelist, Catherine Rample, you should lawyer up [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=840.72s)]
*  when she dared to point out what all of us saw with our own eyes. Yeah, I saw that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=845.5200000000001s)]
*  You spoke to more than 200 people for this book, David, I believe, but as expected, writing a book [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=849.68s)]
*  about libel law and defamation and billionaires and secret plots, you found yourself subjected, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=854.4s)]
*  I believe, to intimidation, tactics and legal threats. What happened to you? How did you [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=860.0799999999999s)]
*  navigate while writing a book about libel law? Well, I kind of sit in a position of slight [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=864.8s)]
*  privilege professionally, quite personally as well, but there's, you know, I have the backing of the [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=872.0s)]
*  New York Times as my employer and HarperCollins as my publisher. So, you know, both of those places [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=877.12s)]
*  have big budgets and awesome lawyers. And so it's not as scary for me as it would be if I were [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=882.96s)]
*  independent or even worked at a smaller outlet. But frankly, some of the threats I received and [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=890.48s)]
*  some of the efforts that people I was writing about used to intimidate my sources and try to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=895.28s)]
*  kind of unmask their identities. I found really surprising and alarming, which is saying something [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=902.4000000000001s)]
*  because I had at that point spent years researching and reporting on these tactics. And I get it in [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=908.08s)]
*  in the book, I can narrate some of these instances where they came after me. And again, the concern I [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=913.84s)]
*  have there is not about me because I work for the New York Times and HarperCollins is my publisher. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=920.5600000000001s)]
*  My concern is that they're using those tactics against me. They're also likely to be using them [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=925.6s)]
*  against other people who lack the institutional backing and the money to fight back. And that's [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=930.32s)]
*  really potentially will really create quite a chilling effect, I think. It is a chilling effect [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=936.5600000000001s)]
*  that we're all worried about. David, thank you for writing this book and thank you for coming on [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sau8WB1qOyI&t=942.1600000000001s)]
