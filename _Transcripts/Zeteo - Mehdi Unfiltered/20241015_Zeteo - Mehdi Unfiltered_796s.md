Video Description: Lebanese academic and London School of Economics Professor, Fawaz Gerges joins ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’ to discuss Israel’s military strategy in Lebanon, including the killing of Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah, and how the war in Gaza could change the international order. 

Gerges talks to Mehdi Hasan about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s latest message to the Lebanese people, in which Netanyahu called on the Lebanese people to, “stand up and take their country back” from Hezbollah or face the same suffering Israel has inflicted on Gaza. 

“What Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition are trying to do is to instigate a civil war in Lebanon. They're calling on the Lebanese to rise up to revolt against Hezbollah, knowing full well that Hezbollah is an integral part of the social fabric [in Lebanon],” Gerges says.

*  Fawaz thank you so much for joining me on Mehdi unfiltered before we get into the politics of this war [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=14.24s)]
*  How is your family in Lebanon doing? I understand your father is still in Lebanon. Yes [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=19.12s)]
*  Yeah, not just my father. I mean my sister my friends my [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  cousins, you know, we have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=30.04s)]
*  Extended families. I think if you ask me to in one word [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=33.0s)]
*  My family and the population at large are traumatized. They are shocked [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=37.64s)]
*  The country had a major severe economic crisis in the past five years [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=44.8s)]
*  There is no functioning government the currency has collapsed and now the war Israel's war in Lebanon [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  So you could imagine the fear the pain the trauma that the population is witnessing has been witnessing [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=56.06s)]
*  In the past two weeks in particular [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  How does all of this damage and destruction [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=66.22s)]
*  Fawaz that Israel is inflicting on Lebanon right now. How does it compare with not only Israel's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  2006 war on Lebanon, which was the last big war between the two sides [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=74.98s)]
*  But also Lebanon's own civil war back in the 70s and 80s which where there was so much violence and destruction [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=78.66s)]
*  What's happening now compare with Lebanon's sad history [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=83.88000000000001s)]
*  Well, you can actually compare [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=87.48s)]
*  Israel's I mean destructive power. I mean the bombings continuous bombings [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=90.48s)]
*  Hundreds if not thousands of air raids in the past two weeks [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Israel bombing the heart of Beirut. It's bombing the southern suburbs [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=103.48s)]
*  It bombing the south of Lebanon the back of valley bombing. I mean literally [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=108.16s)]
*  is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  destroying a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=114.88000000000001s)]
*  huge chunk of Lebanon not to mention I mean in the past two weeks Mehdi [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=116.28s)]
*  Lebanon has witnessed the greatest displacement [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=123.08s)]
*  Crisis in its history. Yeah, 1.2 million people have been displaced [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=126.44s)]
*  Imagine a country that was no economy [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=131.2s)]
*  where a huge [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=135.04s)]
*  segment of your population [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=137.16s)]
*  They're living on the streets in car parks [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=138.84s)]
*  Hospitals are overwhelmed [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=142.6s)]
*  More than one thousand four hundred people have been killed [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  Many of them are children and women and medics [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=148.6s)]
*  I mean the extent of destruction that Israel is visiting on Lebanon is really unprecedented [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  Even though the civil war between 1975 and 1990 was extremely [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  devastating and of course Israel's invasion of Lebanon in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=164.72s)]
*  1982 and then [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=169.2s)]
*  2006 but this is really qualitatively [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=171.2s)]
*  different in the sense of the firepower and the destructiveness of Israel's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=173.64s)]
*  military and powers that's and haven't has unleashed on Lebanon [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=179.76s)]
*  And of course you have Benjamin Netanyahu this week putting out a video [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=184.16s)]
*  Saying the Lebanese people basically need to turn on one another [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=188.95999999999998s)]
*  Eliminate certain political groups including his bull which is a Lebanese political group [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=193.2s)]
*  Not just an armed group unless the people of Lebanon quote take their country back [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=196.76s)]
*  He said Lebanon would be turned into Gaza, right? He cited the Gaza analogy now [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=201.56s)]
*  I just wonder [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=209.64s)]
*  When you hear those comments first of all, what's your reaction but also this idea that [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=212.32s)]
*  Hezbollah is some kind of ISIS foreign group that's implanted in Lebanon. It can be thrown out. That's just not real is it? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=217.52s)]
*  Well, maybe we need to understand the context of Benjamin Netanyahu's message to the Lebanese people [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  I had also another message to the Iranian people just a week ago [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=231.58s)]
*  I think Netanyahu and the security military [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=235.86s)]
*  Establishment in Israel knows very well. They cannot defeat Hezbollah on the battlefield. It's almost an impossible mission [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=241.58s)]
*  It will take not just one year two years. It will take a decade or two [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=249.06s)]
*  Remember Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and for 18 years it failed to defeat Hezbollah [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=253.46s)]
*  In fact Hezbollah forced Israel to retreat in defeat in 2000 [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=260.5s)]
*  So what Israel is trying to do with Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition are trying to do is to instigate a civil war in Lebanon [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=265.1s)]
*  They're calling on the Lebanese to rise up to revolt against Hezbollah knowing full well [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=273.58s)]
*  That Hezbollah is an integral part of the social fabric that Hezbollah is one of the most powerful [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=279.92s)]
*  Political and military organization in the country, but maybe don't worry about the Lebanese [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=287.12s)]
*  The Lebanese know Netanyahu for what he is. The messenger is utterly discredited. He has blood on his hands [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=292.36s)]
*  He's telling he tells the Lebanese that he's a friend of the Lebanese and guess what he's killing civilians [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=299.12s)]
*  He's destroying their country. So people are not dumb people know what Netanyahu is all about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=304.4s)]
*  But also his message was in English, of course [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=310.28s)]
*  It's designed not just for the Lebanese designed for the Americans. Look, we love the Lebanon [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  We're not really at war with Lebanon [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=319.12s)]
*  We are at war with Hezbollah yet at the same time [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=321.12s)]
*  He's really destroying big chunks of the city and hitting Beirut very hard and killing many civilians [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=324.12s)]
*  including I mean the the attack on the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=330.23999999999995s)]
*  10th of October in the heart of Beirut [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  22 people were killed and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=338.78s)]
*  Almost hundred injured because he was Israel was targeting a political official a Hezbollah political official in Beirut [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=341.08s)]
*  So Israel also killed Hezbollah's top leader Hassan Nasrallah dropped a bunch of apartment buildings to do it [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=348.96s)]
*  You wrote an op-ed for the New York Times basically saying that Israel's actions were not making [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=355.0s)]
*  Israel safer and would ultimately not wipe out Hezbollah. Can you explain that briefly to our viewers? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=359.44s)]
*  Well, maybe what we need to understand the celebration in Israel and the United States are very premature [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=365.12s)]
*  Hezbollah, of course has suffered major blows painful heavy blows [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  Israel has killed several top commanders and leaders. It has infiltrated these communications [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=377.12s)]
*  The explosions it exploded the stages and walkie-talkies, but Hezbollah is a huge organization [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah is not a spent force [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=390.48s)]
*  deeply institutionalized with many late layers of skilled and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=392.64000000000004s)]
*  Hardened fighters and in the past few days after Benjamin Netanyahu declaring to the world that he's winning [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=397.32000000000005s)]
*  Hezbollah seems to has to have taken the initiative [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=404.72s)]
*  It's back on its feet its fighting back and he's basically inflicting major casualties on the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=407.6s)]
*  Israeli [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  Ground forces that have attempted to invade Lebanon and the reality is in the past few days [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=416.84s)]
*  Hezbollah has been really [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  basically [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=425.71999999999997s)]
*  Exchanging major missiles and major attack with Israel in the very heart of Israel [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  So even even if Israel invades Lebanon, let's say if Israel sent a thousand troops to Lebanon [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=433.55999999999995s)]
*  Even the United States the most powerful nation in the world could not pacify a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=441.88s)]
*  Committed insurgency in Afghanistan or Iraq Israel failed to do [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=448.04s)]
*  in between 1982 and 2000 so the reality is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=453.12s)]
*  This is really Benjamin Netanyahu's [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=459.24s)]
*  Mission act I mean accomplished in Lebanon [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  But the war has really not started from as well as point of view and as you mentioned Israel is time and again [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=465.76000000000005s)]
*  seen that trying to eliminate a [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=471.8s)]
*  Group like Hezbollah through military campaigns that doesn't make Israel safer. It doesn't give them a victory on the battlefield [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=474.48s)]
*  So why do they keep doing it for us? Is it it's not about security then is it it's about something else [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think what we need to understand is that Benjamin Netanyahu and his coalition his extremist religious [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=487.04s)]
*  Coalition are really obsessed with military power. They're obsessed with total victory. They're really delusional [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=493.72s)]
*  Even the Americans who are feeding Israel's war who are shielding Israel who are providing intelligence [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=501.92s)]
*  And ammunition and arms have warned the Israelis against repeating the same mistake that the United States did between 2001 and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=509.12s)]
*  2021 [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=517.16s)]
*  But this is really a delusional coalition and also we need to take into account [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=519.28s)]
*  That Benjamin Netanyahu is very much interested in Benjamin Netanyahu his legacy and political future online [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=523.8s)]
*  So imagine is going he's taking on Hezbollah [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  Lebanon is not Gaza and Hezbollah is not Hamas [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=534.8s)]
*  He could not he has not been able to defeat Hamas after 12 months [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=538.52s)]
*  He has destroyed Gaza yet Hamas continues to resist in Lebanon Hezbollah can call on [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=543.16s)]
*  2,000 on 200,000 fighters one point about Hezbollah Mahdi because people in the West in the United States [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=550.36s)]
*  Americans and Westerners think that Hezbollah is a Shia dominated party is an Iranian driven party [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=557.08s)]
*  People don't realize that Hezbollah is part of a coalition a broad coalition in Lebanon [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=564.28s)]
*  Al-Gama'a Al-Islamiyya a Sunni dominated group is fully engaged in the war against Israel [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=569.88s)]
*  You have Marxists you have leftists you have secularists you have Arab nationalists [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=575.88s)]
*  So Hezbollah is not just one solo [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=581.28s)]
*  Parallel to the actor in the equation and I think with the reservists Hezbollah can [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=585.84s)]
*  There are plenty of young men [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=592.12s)]
*  Harden advanced fighters who could really join the fray [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=594.6s)]
*  In the south and that's why is Israel Israel is reluctant to really launch a full invasion [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=598.48s)]
*  of southern Lebanon and relying on [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=605.36s)]
*  psychological warfare and trying to convince the Lebanese the pro-american [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=608.28s)]
*  faction in Lebanon and the anti Hezbollah faction to rise up and take up arms against Hezbollah because [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=613.4s)]
*  Netanyahu and his coalition know very well only civil strife in Lebanon would deliver [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=619.28s)]
*  Hezbollah to the Israelis because this really would mean the destruction of Lebanon or what remains of Lebanon so far [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=625.28s)]
*  One last question for as you're an expert on terrorism, especially quote-unquote jihadist terror [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1SlYhxE3Hw&t=631.64s)]
