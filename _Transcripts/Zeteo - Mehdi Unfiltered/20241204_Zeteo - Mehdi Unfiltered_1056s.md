Video Description: Rising Democratic Party star Anderson Clayton joins "Mehdi Unfiltered" to discuss where the election went wrong, and why the Democratic Party did well in North Carolina, despite voters there picking Trump for president.

At just 26 years old, Clayton is the youngest-ever state party chair, representing the Democrats in the red state of North Carolina, where Democrats secured the races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and secretary of state in this election.

Clayton explains to Mehdi Hasan why voters in North Carolina elected both Donald Trump and Democrats at the same time.

“I don’t think that a political party defines how somebody is going to vote on the ballot. I think that they are looking for a person right now, and that’s why it matters the types of candidates that we run,” Clayton tells Mehdi in this wide-ranging interview.

Watch the interview to hear about political messaging in rural communities, the North Carolina GOP’s attempt to curb the incoming governor’s powers, and whether she’ll throw her hat in the ring for DNC chair.

# Democrats 'Abandoned Talking to Every Single Voter': Rising Dem Party Star on Losing the Election
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [December 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI)
*  Back in the summer, when Kamala Harris was riding high in the polls, filling out stadiums, talking about joy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=0.0s)]
*  there was talk of Democrats flipping Republican-leaning swing states like North Carolina that hadn't gone blue for almost two decades. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=6.0s)]
*  But of course, that didn't happen. No, instead, North Carolina, like every other swing state, went for Trump, even saw their young voters shift to the right. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=13.0s)]
*  And yet, despite what people might expect from a southern Trump-voting state, Democrats in North Carolina actually did amazingly well at the state level, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=22.0s)]
*  winning the races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and secretary of state, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=30.0s)]
*  as well as winning enough seats to finally end the Republican supermajority in the state legislature. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=35.0s)]
*  So what happened in the Tar Heel state, and what lessons are there for Democrats nationally as they do their post-Harris post-mortem? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=41.0s)]
*  Who better to unpack it all with than the state's own Democratic Party Chair, Anderson Clayton, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=49.0s)]
*  who was elected to that role last year at the age of just 25 and is currently the youngest state party chair in the country. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=54.0s)]
*  Anderson, thanks so much for coming on May the Unfiltered. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=61.0s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=64.0s)]
*  So, I mean, let's just jump in with the most obvious question of all. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=66.0s)]
*  Well, what are Democrats in North Carolina doing to win votes at a state level that Democrats at the national federal level are unable to do? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=70.0s)]
*  How do you explain the disconnect? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=79.0s)]
*  I mean, I think we have to talk about the role of disinformation in this election cycle and the Republican apparatus [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=81.0s)]
*  and really the MAGA apparatus that we saw over the last four years, like, spreading disinformation and misinformation about the Biden presidency, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=88.0s)]
*  about Kamala Harris as a vice president. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=98.0s)]
*  And I think that oftentimes folks forget about the way in which that nationalization of politics has really impacted the way that media covers races. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=100.0s)]
*  And we don't have that necessarily in the state of North Carolina. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=108.0s)]
*  We could very quickly. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=111.0s)]
*  But I think that that's something where our state party has got to be able to go on the offensive over the next four and six years as we look to making sure that we're taking back a majority in our state legislature as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=112.0s)]
*  You know, the last time North Carolina went for a Democratic president was the last time that we had a Democratic majority in our state legislature. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=122.0s)]
*  And I really think that those two things correlate very clearly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=128.0s)]
*  And we need to make sure that we're advocating for localized approaches to politics in our states. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=131.0s)]
*  So I'm curious to know, what do you say to critics outside of North Carolina who may label the voters there as, I don't know, weird, insane, ignorant? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=136.0s)]
*  What kind of people vote for Democrats at a state level, but then vote for Donald Trump at a national level? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=147.0s)]
*  How do you explain that disconnect to people who see how well you did in every statewide race, including the legislature, the governor, obviously, and then Trump? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=152.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's the history in North Carolina. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=163.0s)]
*  Democrats have a record of being very progressive when it comes to the state level in terms of public education. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=165.0s)]
*  Democrats are the party that built the public education system in North Carolina and made us number one for higher education in the state when it comes to a university system that includes over 16 public universities throughout the state that have each contributed to a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=172.0s)]
*  geographical economic region and a driver, honestly, for these regions in our state as well. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=187.0s)]
*  And so I think that a lot of times people at the local level have really associated the Democratic Party with an economic message, and we didn't shy away from that this year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=193.0s)]
*  But we also didn't shy away from an abortion message this year. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=202.0s)]
*  Democrats in North Carolina, in my opinion, ran on protecting personal freedoms, making sure that public education survived and was strong in our state. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=205.0s)]
*  We also want Mo Green as our next superintendent in North Carolina, along with those other four statewide races as well that you talked about. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=215.0s)]
*  And I think that it's really important for people to know that these public schools are the number one economic driver in our rural communities right now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=223.0s)]
*  And the Democratic Party are the ones that have built that up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=230.0s)]
*  And that was really taking a local message and servicing it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=233.0s)]
*  And I think that we could have done that across the country this year. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=236.0s)]
*  When you look at states like Kentucky that also beat out private school voucher funding and taking away and defunding the number one economic driver in every county in Kentucky as well, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=238.0s)]
*  there are states across the country that we could have utilized this messaging in more. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=247.0s)]
*  So I want to come back to the rural angle in a moment, but just on something you said a moment ago, you said you did a lot of strong economic messaging and abortion rights as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=251.0s)]
*  A lot of the postmortems since November the 5th have been about how well abortion rights were not enough to get Kamala Harris across the line. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=261.0s)]
*  Democrats ride too much on the abortion message and not enough on the economic message. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=268.0s)]
*  Back in 2023, you told Politico you were hoping to see North Carolina flip blue in the presidential race, which hasn't happened since 08. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=272.0s)]
*  Do you blame the lack of flipping on that lack of a strong, maybe populist economic message? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=279.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that you have to take this not at the micro level, but at the macro level. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=288.0s)]
*  What we saw in the United States was not what we saw across the country or across the world too. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=293.0s)]
*  There's a global message here as well with the fact that we're in a post-pandemic economy and where people felt like that their pocketbooks were struggling. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=298.0s)]
*  And at the end of the day, we were not talking enough about who to blame for that in terms of corporate consolidation, monopolies that we have right now in every single major industry that's taken away even from places like North Carolina where you look at the consolidation of agriculture. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=309.0s)]
*  I mean, that in and of itself is something where our party could have talked more about. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=324.0s)]
*  But I don't know that it could have defied this global red wave that we have seen so far. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=328.0s)]
*  And I think that we just don't need to shy away from our values, which is the critique that I keep hearing from people that we've got to backtrack our messaging. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=333.0s)]
*  And I'm like, no, people just realize that they could vote for abortion rights and Donald Trump on the ballot this year. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=340.0s)]
*  And that was something that should really take a look inward of ourselves is why people don't feel like that should have been associated with our party being pro-choice and pro-protecting abortion rights in every way, shape and form. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=345.0s)]
*  So you I know. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=357.0s)]
*  So you don't buy the argument from some members of Congress in your party say, well, we were too woke. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=359.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=364.0s)]
*  But I also represent a different generation than a lot of those folks. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=366.0s)]
*  You certainly do. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=369.0s)]
*  But interestingly, you're saying a lot of interesting things outside of Democratic Party comfort zones. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=371.0s)]
*  A few years ago, when you were leading Democrats in rural Roxburgh County, you famously swapped the Democratic donkey branding for a rural matters slogan. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=375.0s)]
*  I believe you also knocked on 600 doors to help flip the county's city council. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=383.0s)]
*  What did you learn about rural voters from that time period? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=388.0s)]
*  Do you think Democrats need to understand now? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=391.0s)]
*  Do you think those voters are a lost cause? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=394.0s)]
*  No, I don't think anybody's a lost cause. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=396.0s)]
*  I actually think after this election cycle, we should be looking at every single person as somebody we're talking to, which is what we said a lot in North Carolina as well this year is that we wanted to reach out to every single voter, because I don't think that a political party defines how somebody is going to be. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=398.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=412.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=414.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=416.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=418.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=420.0s)]

*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=436.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=438.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=440.0s)]

*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=445.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=447.0s)]

*  I think that's ridiculous to me. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=455.0s)]
*  It became very well-known to many people through a CNN article that came out of him in porn shops, in case anyone is familiar with that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=457.0s)]
*  Democrats as people that saw folks that are change-oriented candidates too. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=461.0s)]
*  Do you think Senator Bernie Sanders had a point when he said that Democrats have abandoned [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=465.28s)]
*  the working class and so in return the working class, or at least the white working class, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=468.92s)]
*  has abandoned the Democrats? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=472.96s)]
*  I think we've abandoned talking to every single voter and I think that that's where, you know, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=475.36s)]
*  when we're looking at huge swaths of populations. North Carolina, I tell people this all the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=480.28s)]
*  time, I'm like 58% of our state still lives in a rural community. Like I couldn't get [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=484.04s)]
*  away with just talking to an urban area and nor do I want to, as you can probably tell that I'm [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=488.48s)]
*  coming to you from a rural part of the state right now. I think that it is important that we [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=492.4s)]
*  reach out and that we are looking at how do you have a statewide apparatus that actually engages [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=496.88s)]
*  every single region because we have got people that would buy into and that would believe in [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=502.32s)]
*  a Democratic message again just if they heard one. But the lack of localized messaging and the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=506.4s)]
*  lack of, you know, local reporting, I tell people all the time, local journalism is dying in our [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=511.44s)]
*  rural communities and has been because of consolidation of the newspaper industry and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=515.84s)]
*  other forms of media and Democrats have got to get back into these areas and help tell the other [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=520.0s)]
*  side of a story because right now people are only being fed one side and I'm like that's not true [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=524.32s)]
*  and it's actually impacting you in a different way than it's impacting people in other communities. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=529.0400000000001s)]
*  Like I said, public schools, like it's the number one economic driver in these rural communities. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=533.6s)]
*  Everybody knows that their sister, their aunt, somebody in their family is related to or is married [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=538.32s)]
*  to a public school teacher and we've got to make sure that people know that Democrats are the party [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=543.12s)]
*  that's fought for opportunity everywhere and the equalizing of a playing field that includes [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=547.28s)]
*  making sure anybody, no matter where you come from, has the opportunity to get where you want to go. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=552.8s)]
*  In 2020, President Biden won young voters in your state by 16%. In this cycle, Harris's lead dropped [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=557.5999999999999s)]
*  to 4%, I believe, with Trump winning 47% of the youth vote. How worried are you about Republicans [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=565.12s)]
*  being able to continue cutting in to what was once a key Democratic party demographic, the young [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=570.96s)]
*  voters, and is there any way for Democrats to bring back the enthusiasm that we saw from young [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=576.1600000000001s)]
*  people, especially in the Obama era? I mean we need to run young people and that's something where [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=581.2800000000001s)]
*  young folks right now are more likely to vote, they're 60% more likely to vote for a young person [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=586.72s)]
*  on the ballot regardless of what political party that they're affiliated with and I think that we [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=591.76s)]
*  have to look at young people as a voting bloc that wants to see themselves represented and when you [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=595.76s)]
*  look at any marginalized demographic in political history, when the first sort of phase of the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=601.2s)]
*  awakening in politics to me is representation and then you move on to the other phase of looking at [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=607.2s)]
*  it and saying, okay well does the people that look like me actually represent what's best for [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=612.16s)]
*  my community and that is a second phase that I don't think that young folks have fully gotten [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=616.24s)]
*  to yet and that's why you see a lot of the the framing of this election cycle around young [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=620.16s)]
*  people I think. And you yourself practice what you preach, you ousted the 73 year old incumbent [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=625.12s)]
*  Bobby Richardson as chair of the North Carolina Democratic party and you seem to have brought [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=630.4s)]
*  about some very real changes at the state level since you did so but what about the national level? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=634.88s)]
*  You've got someone like Chuck Schumer who's in his 70s, Senate majority leader just lost the Senate, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=638.88s)]
*  should people like that be encouraged to step aside for a new generation of leadership at the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=643.12s)]
*  national level too? I think that everyone should question you know why am I still here and I think [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=646.64s)]
*  that I mean I think if you have the ability to say and give an answer to that then great but I [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=653.44s)]
*  also it's what I would tell anybody right now that looks at me and says I want to run for office and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=658.72s)]
*  I'm like great what do you want to change? What do you want to do? Why do you want to do that? And [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=662.16s)]
*  there should be an answer that goes along with it. It shouldn't just be oh I want it and and I think [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=666.0s)]
*  that a lot of our party has to look internally at you know why are you still in these positions and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=670.24s)]
*  can you help somebody and a lot of the people that have helped me in this role right they [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=675.36s)]
*  are the institutional knowledge is something that we need as young people in roles like this but [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=680.48s)]
*  I just wish that there was an opportunity to look at it and say you know and question why we should [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=684.9599999999999s)]
*  all be doing that consistently I think. And just on the on the youth vote before we move forward a [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=690.3199999999999s)]
*  few days after the election you tweeted that quote I genuinely believe young people need to stick [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  together in our party. I know the split that we find ourselves in right now will not serve us it [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  will only serve the right. What split were you referring to and what do you make of people who [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=703.04s)]
*  say that young voters were split on Gaza in particular? I think that young people need to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=707.36s)]
*  understand that we've got enough people in our party that want to attack us and blame us for an [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=713.2s)]
*  election and and that we are we are stronger together you know there's a saying about coalitions [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=717.36s)]
*  that it's not always people that you like that are in them but you recognize that you're not [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  going to get anywhere without each other and I think that young people regardless of sort of what [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=726.24s)]
*  side you know part or not partisan but just like policy wise that you feel like you're in in this [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=730.48s)]
*  party right now we recognize that it's better when more people are involved in it and when [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=736.64s)]
*  when more people are being questioned in it and I think that we've got to be able to to do that and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=741.12s)]
*  I don't think that we should be criticizing young people each other for how we feel and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=745.92s)]
*  are how we're engaging in political organizing right now. I think that everybody's got a lane [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=750.8s)]
*  to play and we should always be uplifting each other. Do you think Gaza did you see the impact [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=754.88s)]
*  of Gaza on the ground in a place like North Carolina with young voters? Absolutely I mean I [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=758.72s)]
*  think that you saw it from UNC's perspective you know UNC Chapel Hill had one of our largest [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=763.28s)]
*  campus protests but I also think that I heard a lot of those students still say we're voting for [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=767.8399999999999s)]
*  down-ballot Democrats we understand the the political power in voting and I even think [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=772.56s)]
*  that we should have been you know the uncommitted movement was something that I actually really [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=777.8399999999999s)]
*  I think it was them using political power in the right way because it's something where it's not [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=782.16s)]
*  discouraging people from the political process it's saying no let's use it to have our voices [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=786.0s)]
*  heard and that's something where Democrats should be taking it and embracing it and saying like that [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=790.88s)]
*  is something that we want to see more of in our party is the the ability to come to the table [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=795.6s)]
*  rather than run away from it because right now people do not want to build up the Democratic [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=799.76s)]
*  party it seems like people are more interested in going around it and I'm like that is not how our [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=803.76s)]
*  system is going to work right now at least in the most effective way for us to gain political power [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=808.88s)]
*  and that's what I care about as a young person. So given all that and given what you just said [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=813.28s)]
*  are you considering throwing your hat into the ring for the Democratic National Committee chair? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=817.6s)]
*  No I do not think that I have the experience to do that yet I think that North Carolina needs [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=821.84s)]
*  somebody to have sustainable vision and be able to win another Supreme Court seat in 26. You know [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=827.44s)]
*  we're going through a recount right now in our Supreme Court race for Justice Allison Riggs to [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=834.24s)]
*  keep her seat on the bench it was won by 722 votes across our state we were able to run a chasing [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=838.64s)]
*  program that helped cure over 1800 ballots in the state and that was through working with strong [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=845.44s)]
*  partner organizations and making sure that people's voices got to actually count this year and I think [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=850.6400000000001s)]
*  I have a lot of work left to do in this state to be honest. So who are you supporting for the DNC [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=856.0s)]
*  role what kind of person do you think should be running the DNC what kind of vision what kind of [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=859.6800000000001s)]
*  politics? I'll be honest this sounds bad after everything I just said to you probably but I [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=862.8800000000001s)]
*  could be bought in the way of I think that somebody needs to come in and say state party chairs should [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=867.2800000000001s)]
*  be paid state parties and the infrastructure of our party should be worth more than less than 7% [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=872.4s)]
*  of the DNC's annual budget which is what it is now 25% is what I would take I could be negotiated [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=877.84s)]
*  down to 15 though but I think that somebody needs to seriously look at where they could put their [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=883.28s)]
*  money because the DNC is a fundraising vehicle and we need to be you know people talked about [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=887.52s)]
*  it a lot this year we raised a lot of money and you know it wasn't the money that was the problem [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=892.56s)]
*  it was how it was spent and I think that we need to reevaluate why down ballot Democrats lost in [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=897.04s)]
*  some of our races that could have been winnable because of where funding went this year and a lot [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=901.92s)]
*  of the bang for our buck that we could get are in states like North Carolina in states like the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=906.7199999999999s)]
*  south right now we have 55% of black voters and black people in at this moment in time but folks [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=911.12s)]
*  are not considering us as a place where you can gain political power right now. Last question last [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=917.5999999999999s)]
*  week North Carolina's GOP control legislature passed a bill designed to strip the new incoming [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=923.36s)]
*  Democratic governor and the new attorney general also Democratic of crucial powers including [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=928.4s)]
*  appointing the state election board filling court vacancies and challenging laws passed by the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=933.6s)]
*  legislature if that bill succeeds how bad is that going to be for Democrats in North Carolina how [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  much will democracy be undermined in North Carolina what plan or ability do you have to fight back? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=943.68s)]
*  When you have an attorney general that doesn't have the ability to sue against unconstitutional [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=949.52s)]
*  laws or things that they find to be unconstitutional I think we're in great danger and [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=954.0s)]
*  Senate bill 382 is what it is right now that's going through our legislature it just passed [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=959.36s)]
*  our house and our Senate and it is on Governor Cooper's desk right now to be vetoed and we are [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=965.44s)]
*  going to see if we can have the three Republicans that voted against the bill three western Democrats [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=970.4s)]
*  or western North Carolina Republicans that voted against the bill in the legislature originally [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=976.48s)]
*  to uphold Cooper's veto on this bill right now because it was supposed to guarantee millions over [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=981.92s)]
*  221 millions of dollars to go towards hurricane helene relief that is what this bill was originated [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=988.16s)]
*  and intended for and Republicans have taken it and politicized it in order to being a 131 page bill [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=993.5999999999999s)]
*  where only 12 of it actually addresses hurricane relief the rest of it to your point addresses [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=1000.3199999999999s)]
*  taking away powers from Democratic elected officials incoming that voters voted to give [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=1005.12s)]
*  them that power and this is an extreme disenfranchisement of their power so we plan [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=1010.16s)]
*  to do everything we can in court and otherwise to be able to take on and protect these powers but [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=1014.8s)]
*  we also know what we're up against right now in our court system and what we're fighting back [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=1019.28s)]
*  against and Republicans are nervous about losing their supermajority come January that's what we [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=1022.8s)]
*  know from this I think that's an understatement they're so keen to shore up their supermajority [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5izMFoq3NI&t=1027.92s)]
