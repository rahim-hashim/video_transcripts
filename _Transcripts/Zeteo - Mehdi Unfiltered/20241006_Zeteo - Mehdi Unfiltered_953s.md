Video Description: “When we report about famine, we're not eating food. When we’re reporting about diseases, We're being sick… When we report about people being killed, we’re being killed.”

Palestinian Journalists Hind Khoudary joins Mehdi Hasan in this special segment of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’, to discuss putting her life on the line while she covers the Israeli genocide of her occupied people in Gaza.

Since the start of the war, Khoudary has amassed nearly one and a half million followers between Instagram and Twitter. After all the bloodshed, she says she has seen very little support from her colleagues in the West.

Hind is one of the few remaining journalists in occupied Gaza. Israel has already killed at least 127 journalists and media workers there since Oct. 7.

# "They ABANDONED Us": Palestinian journalist Hind Khoudary on covering Gaza
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0)
*  There are many heroes in occupied Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=0.0s)]
*  The doctors and nurses having to treat some of the worst injuries [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=2.4s)]
*  one can witness under horrific conditions, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=5.08s)]
*  parents consoling their children under the constant barrage [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=7.88s)]
*  of rocket fire, and journalists. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=11.08s)]
*  Yes, journalists risking their lives to make sure every one [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=13.52s)]
*  of those voices is heard by the rest of the world. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=16.68s)]
*  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=19.56s)]
*  more than 114 journalists and media workers have been killed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=21.48s)]
*  since the start of Israel's genocide in occupied Gaza. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=25.6s)]
*  In fact, more journalists have been killed in the first 10 weeks [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=29.2s)]
*  of the Israel-Gaza war than have ever been killed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=32.72s)]
*  in a single country over an entire year. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=35.92s)]
*  The organisation further adds that these killings have reflected [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=39.32s)]
*  a pattern of targeting journalists and their families [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=41.64s)]
*  by the Israeli military. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=44.8s)]
*  My next guest is one of those heroes, many would argue, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=46.44s)]
*  working to get the story of Gaza out into the wider world. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Her work has been crucial as Israel commits more and more crimes [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=51.76s)]
*  in that occupied strip. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=54.76s)]
*  She has witnessed some of the worst atrocities of this century, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  and I would argue experienced loss very few people can know. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=59.4s)]
*  Hind Qudri is a Palestinian journalist based in occupied Gaza, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  and she joins me now. Hind, thank you so much, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=65.8s)]
*  in the middle of all this chaos, for joining us on Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=68.16s)]
*  Let me start by asking you right now, where are you, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=71.52s)]
*  what is the situation like where you're at? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=74.44s)]
*  I'm currently in Deir el-Balach, and I have been displaced [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  from the Gaza city to Deir el-Balach in November 2023. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=82.56s)]
*  And the situation is crazy every single day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=87.84s)]
*  Continuous explosions, continuous artillery shelling, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  and not only that, the amount of displacement. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=97.08s)]
*  Deir el-Balach is now a makeshift camp for millions of Palestinians, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=99.88s)]
*  and this is how we're living right now. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=106.92s)]
*  And so, not only, like, the air strikes or displacement, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=109.52s)]
*  it's also the humanitarian and the house situation, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=114.28s)]
*  and also the sewage, the garbage, diseases. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=118.28s)]
*  So, the impact of war, we're talking about a year now. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=121.92s)]
*  So, it's beyond anyone could ever imagine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=125.6s)]
*  Did you ever imagine we would still be here in this situation [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=129.4s)]
*  a year in, because previous Gaza conflicts were horrible, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=133.28s)]
*  but they were over in weeks or months? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=136.56s)]
*  Did you ever imagine we'd be here October 2024? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=138.92s)]
*  That's awful. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=168.92s)]
*  And Hind, unfortunately, it being a year [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=171.0s)]
*  and people being how they are, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=174.0s)]
*  a lot of people have moved on from Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=176.04s)]
*  I'm here in the West, where I watched a lot of people [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=177.83999999999997s)]
*  looking at Instagram every day, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=180.44s)]
*  watching clips from people like yourself, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  and seeing how they were being treated, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=183.76s)]
*  and I'm not sure if that's the case. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  But I'm sure that's the case. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=188.04s)]
*  And I'm sure that's the case. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  And I'm sure that's the case. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=191.16s)]
*  And I'm sure that's the case. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=192.64s)]
*  And I'm sure that's the case. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=194.0s)]
*  And I'm sure that's the case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  So, you were watching clips every day, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=196.67999999999998s)]
*  watching clips from people like yourself and Bissan and Mottaz, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  24 hours a day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=201.92s)]
*  And then, I guess, people became numb to it, right? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  As time goes by, it became kind of background noise, sadly, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=206.0s)]
*  for a lot of people in the West. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=209.48s)]
*  What has it been like for people in Gaza? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=211.16s)]
*  How do you get used to being in the middle of this? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=213.2s)]
*  Can you get used to it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=216.11999999999998s)]
*  How have people adjusted their lives to adapt [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=217.32s)]
*  to living under constant attack for 12 months? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=220.04s)]
*  Well, you're never used to it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=223.52s)]
*  Likes being very clear that you're never used to it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=225.88s)]
*  Every single day is a new day of horror. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=229.56s)]
*  It's a new day of another massacre, atrocities. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  Like, every single second that passes by, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=239.76000000000002s)]
*  it's a different way of violence, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  kind of like Israel, by the Palestinians. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  But the fact is, like, people believe that Palestinians are so resilient, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=251.16s)]
*  Palestinians are living this, no one's going to break them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=256.96s)]
*  But no, we're all exhausted, we're all tired. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=261.12s)]
*  And one year of this is unimaginable, you know? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=265.4s)]
*  Like, the horror itself of what is being done to us [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=269.04s)]
*  is compounded by the response of the Western countries [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=273.36s)]
*  about, like, how the politicians talk this, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=276.8s)]
*  or denounce Israel for their crimes against humanity. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=279.8s)]
*  I believe, like, in the West, it's a force for good, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=284.48s)]
*  and I think many people around the world [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=287.56s)]
*  no longer see it the way it is anymore. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=291.32s)]
*  And, of course, on that note, you are putting your life on the line [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=294.68s)]
*  every minute of every day to get the story of Gaza out into the wider world. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=297.64s)]
*  I mean, as we pass the 365-day mark, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=302.64s)]
*  do you feel the world is listening to people like yourself? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=307.44s)]
*  To be honest, yes. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=311.24s)]
*  The world, like, part of the world is listening [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=313.44s)]
*  because we've received, like, huge support. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=317.2s)]
*  Like, in the first couple of months, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=320.8s)]
*  I got, like, hundreds of thousands of followers [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=323.8s)]
*  and people who know me from around the globe. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=327.2s)]
*  How did all of these people know me? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=330.12s)]
*  But at the end of the day, yes, people were listening, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=332.4s)]
*  and we were doing, like, a huge effort. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  Like, we, policy internals on the ground, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=339.0s)]
*  we're doing work that these organisations and media outlets worldwide [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  would never cope with very, very minimum of requirements, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  equipment, tools, internet blackouts, no electricity, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=352.44s)]
*  not even having the time to sleep, and not even having a place to sleep. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=356.12s)]
*  Like, how would you report or stand on your feet, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=361.2s)]
*  like, hours and telling the world the story [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=365.04s)]
*  when you're not even being sleeping, not being eating, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=367.96s)]
*  and also separated from your family? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=372.24s)]
*  It's not only, like, we're reporting this, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=374.88s)]
*  but we're also leaving every single detail. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=377.48s)]
*  Like, when we report about famine, we're not eating food. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=380.28s)]
*  When we report about diseases, we're being sick. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=383.4s)]
*  When we report about people not being able to leave, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=386.36s)]
*  we're also not being able to leave. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=389.84s)]
*  And when we report about being killed, we're being killed. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  Like, I remember when the Israeli forces invaded a shifa hospital, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  my uncle was killed, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=401.48s)]
*  and he was on the ground for three days without being buried. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=403.56s)]
*  No-one knew where he was, no-one knew how he was killed, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=408.24s)]
*  and after they withdrew, we were able to bury him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=412.56s)]
*  Until this point, I'm talking about months now, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=417.56s)]
*  I don't know where he is right now. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't know where he's buried, and I know nothing about him, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=422.08s)]
*  and I can't go there. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=425.12s)]
*  And the same about my house, like, my house, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=426.64s)]
*  the house my father built, and all my memories were there, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=429.44s)]
*  and I left the house knowing, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  thinking that I'll be back, like, in five days or a week. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=434.64s)]
*  And literally, I see this video on Instagram, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=438.44s)]
*  I see my house flattened to the floor, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  and until this day, I don't know when it was bombed, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  what happened, and I can't even reach it, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=447.12s)]
*  and it's only 15 minutes from Derelde, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=449.24s)]
*  where I am right now. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=451.68s)]
*  So, it has been very tough. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=453.6s)]
*  It has been very exhausting and draining, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=456.40000000000003s)]
*  but at the same time, this is the only thing we have. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=462.48s)]
*  We were privileged to report about Palestinians [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  and the Palestinian stories, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=469.24s)]
*  and I'm so, I have the honor to report about my people, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=471.16s)]
*  and that's what's keeping me going, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=475.76s)]
*  because every time we report on something [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=477.68s)]
*  and we make more advocacy and something changes, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=480.03999999999996s)]
*  this means the world to me, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=483.28s)]
*  and this means that we change and make power. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=484.4s)]
*  But another thing is, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=487.44s)]
*  I don't think words could ever describe [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  what I'm feeling right now, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=494.32s)]
*  and every single day, every new story or different story, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=496.2s)]
*  it's just as if it's the first day of the war. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  And it's awful what you're going through. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=504.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=506.44s)]
*  You mentioned that a lot of people started following you [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  after October 7th from around the world. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=510.32s)]
*  How do you feel about the people who haven't followed you? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=512.88s)]
*  And when I say the people who haven't followed you, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=515.8s)]
*  I mean Western media. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=517.72s)]
*  A lot of Western media outlets have ignored the work [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=519.72s)]
*  done by Palestinian journalists on the ground. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=521.92s)]
*  I'm amazed at how few journalists in the West [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=523.9599999999999s)]
*  have spoken up in defense of Palestinian journalists [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=526.48s)]
*  who have been killed over the last 12 months. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=529.4s)]
*  This is the greatest killing of journalists [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=532.12s)]
*  in one place in my lifetime. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  And yet you haven't all become course celebers [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=536.76s)]
*  for people in the UK or the US or France. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=540.12s)]
*  What is your message to journalists abroad [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=542.64s)]
*  who have kind of abandoned you all? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=545.16s)]
*  Well, not only they abandoned us, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=549.28s)]
*  but the whole Western media was complicit, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=551.64s)]
*  and still complicit about the genocide. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=555.0799999999999s)]
*  And also, remember that this is still ongoing. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=557.6s)]
*  It didn't end, it didn't stop. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=561.72s)]
*  It's still ongoing. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=563.68s)]
*  And it's the truth that was driving me to do this. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=565.4399999999999s)]
*  And as I mentioned, we're the only people, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=570.68s)]
*  we were the only source for all of these news organizations [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=574.16s)]
*  to report on what's happening. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=578.72s)]
*  All we care about is to portray the truth, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=580.52s)]
*  tell the facts, tell the stories. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=583.3199999999999s)]
*  Me, as him, I have been receiving a lot of hate [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=585.24s)]
*  from a lot of people on Twitter, for example. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=589.04s)]
*  If I just tweet, hi, I'll get people cursing me, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=592.7199999999999s)]
*  people threatening me, people blackmailing me, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=596.8399999999999s)]
*  people telling me that they're gonna find me [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=599.56s)]
*  and they're gonna kill me, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  people telling me that we're gonna find you [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=602.88s)]
*  and bond you and kill you and kill your family. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=605.8s)]
*  And some very famous journalists said [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=608.68s)]
*  that there were no journalists on the ground [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=613.0799999999999s)]
*  just because we're journalists, Palestinian journalists. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=615.56s)]
*  They're foreign journalists who are reporting on Gaza. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=619.4s)]
*  The fact that there was no international journalists [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=623.36s)]
*  on Gaza was also the only way they would receive [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=626.56s)]
*  or know what's happening is us. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=632.4399999999999s)]
*  Either they're journalists, influencers, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=634.84s)]
*  content creators, or even normal citizens. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=637.12s)]
*  And without us, no one would have seen [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=640.28s)]
*  what we have been reporting about. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=643.04s)]
*  Now, another thing for all of these journalists [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=645.9599999999999s)]
*  that believe that we're not credible, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=648.6s)]
*  that believe that we're not talented, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=650.48s)]
*  no, Palestinian journalists are amazing. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  We have great people on the ground. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  We have people that talk different languages. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  We have people that take beautiful photos [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=660.04s)]
*  and they have been not only documenting this, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=664.24s)]
*  but they have been risking their life. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=666.72s)]
*  So on that note, Hind, on that note, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=669.0799999999999s)]
*  what has it been like for you as a reporter [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=671.4s)]
*  to report not just on the deaths of strangers, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=673.16s)]
*  but the deaths of your own colleagues, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=676.36s)]
*  fellow journalists, and knowing, God forbid, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=677.88s)]
*  that could be you? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=679.88s)]
*  The hardest part of all of this was reporting [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=684.28s)]
*  the death or the killing or the injury of our colleagues. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=689.28s)]
*  Every single time we receive this news [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=695.04s)]
*  that someone has been killed or injured, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=697.8s)]
*  the worst moment is when you read the names [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=701.28s)]
*  of a person you know or someone else you know. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=704.72s)]
*  There is a constant fear that this person [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=707.32s)]
*  that you are with today may be killed or injured more. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=710.9200000000001s)]
*  And there has been two incidents [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  where I reported the killing of my colleagues, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=716.7600000000001s)]
*  Sinael Al Ghul and Hamza Al Tahrouh, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=721.08s)]
*  and I was reporting, it was my shift, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=723.84s)]
*  and I was okay before the camera started rolling. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=726.5200000000001s)]
*  And as soon as the anchor started asking me what happened, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=730.44s)]
*  I started crying because how could I be professional [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=735.4s)]
*  and report without crying when it's one of my friends, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=739.28s)]
*  when it's looking on someone you just talked to [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=742.68s)]
*  or you were texting? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=746.04s)]
*  And it was so hard, and I have this constant fear [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=748.12s)]
*  of losing more people. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  Like, the thing I don't want to experience anymore [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=752.72s)]
*  is more loss and more grief [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=757.36s)]
*  because my heart can't handle all of this. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=759.0s)]
*  Like, it has been a year I lost, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=762.1999999999999s)]
*  like maybe dozens of people I know. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=763.9599999999999s)]
*  I lost a lot of close friends, relatives, cousins, uncles, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=767.64s)]
*  and I can't do this anymore. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=773.0s)]
*  It's so hard, and no one could imagine [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=775.0799999999999s)]
*  how hard it is to be and to report this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=779.12s)]
*  It's like you can't even think of the words [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=782.7199999999999s)]
*  when you come and report such incidents. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=785.52s)]
*  I want to play to you an old clip, Hin, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=788.4399999999999s)]
*  that we found of you being interviewed by Vice Arabia [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=790.24s)]
*  back in 2017 when you were answering a question [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=793.68s)]
*  on what the most dangerous thing you had ever done was [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=797.08s)]
*  reporting in Gaza. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=799.68s)]
*  I think we can play that clip. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=800.52s)]
*  When you see that clip now, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=815.72s)]
*  when you see that clip now, what goes through your mind? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=819.12s)]
*  What would you want to tell that version of Hind Kudary? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=821.56s)]
*  That's 2017 when the Great March of the Tahrir March started. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=828.3599999999999s)]
*  At that time, yes, there were Israeli snipers, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=835.9599999999999s)]
*  there were Israeli soldiers in front of us, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=838.8s)]
*  and they were targeting us with two gas canisters. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=841.88s)]
*  Until this day, I'm very traumatized. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=845.8399999999999s)]
*  Every time I see a drone, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=847.88s)]
*  even it was like a filming drone [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=850.24s)]
*  because I remember the two gas canisters, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=852.32s)]
*  but now, no, I totally changed. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  Since the beginning of the war, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=859.72s)]
*  every incident or every time we were reporting, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=861.44s)]
*  there was a very high risk, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=866.04s)]
*  and I wish my mom doesn't hear about it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=867.64s)]
*  There were a lot of incidents [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=870.08s)]
*  where the car beside us gets targeted [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=871.64s)]
*  or the building in front of us gets targeted. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=873.92s)]
*  At one time, I went to my house [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=876.8s)]
*  when it was a danger zone just to collect a couple of shirts [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=879.56s)]
*  because I had to do stuff. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9GkHAWOC_0&t=883.8s)]
