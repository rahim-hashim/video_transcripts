# Israeli Soccer Attacks: Amsterdam Photographer on What Really Happened
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us)
*  Violence erupted in Amsterdam this weekend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=0.0s)]
*  when what started as a soccer match between Maccabi Tel Aviv [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=2.44s)]
*  and Ajax devolved into violent chaos across the city. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=5.72s)]
*  Headlines poured in about anti-Semitic attacks in Amsterdam. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=9.28s)]
*  But these stories largely overlooked on-camera, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=12.8s)]
*  blatant anti-Arab racism from Maccabi supporters [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=15.92s)]
*  well beforehand. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=19.68s)]
*  And yet it was barely a footnote in the coverage. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Despite the fact that footage showed Maccabi supporters [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=23.64s)]
*  chanting racist and genocidal slogans like [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=26.0s)]
*  Death to the Arabs and Let the IDF Win, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=28.48s)]
*  they were seen throwing stones and planks of wood at police [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  after the match. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=34.16s)]
*  Dutch officials also confirmed that fans attacked a taxi driver [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=35.2s)]
*  and burned a Palestinian flag. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=38.72s)]
*  Sky News in the UK posted a video detailing these attacks, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=40.64s)]
*  noting that Maccabi fans are, quote, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=44.4s)]
*  notorious for their racism and physical violence. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=46.36s)]
*  However, that video was quickly deleted, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=49.6s)]
*  and the network stated that the original version [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=51.84s)]
*  failed to meet their standards for balance and impartiality, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  whatever that means. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=57.4s)]
*  Footage taken by Dutch photographer Annette de Graaf [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=58.84s)]
*  was used in both versions of the Sky video, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  showing Maccabi fans attacking a Dutch resident. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=63.76s)]
*  Media outlets like CNN, the BBC, the New York Times [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=66.44s)]
*  also used or misused the very same video, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=69.56s)]
*  twisting the narrative to suggest that Maccabi fans [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=73.04s)]
*  were the ones being attacked. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=76.0s)]
*  We saw headlines about pogroms and world leaders [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=77.64s)]
*  denouncing anti-Semitism in Amsterdam, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=80.44s)]
*  as if these hooligans were just minding their own business, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=83.16s)]
*  as if this was an attack not on Israeli soccer hooligans [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  but on all Dutch Jews. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=88.68s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  De Graaf has called on media outlets to apologise, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=91.56s)]
*  stating that journalism is about finding truth, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=93.76s)]
*  not about making money on a twist of the script. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=96.16s)]
*  And I couldn't have said it better myself. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=99.08s)]
*  Look, no-one is disputing that there were also reports [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  of anti-Semitism, of a person, for example, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=103.6s)]
*  calling for a Jew hunt, which is outrageous [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=105.84s)]
*  and should be condemned. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  All violence on all sides should be condemned. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=109.76s)]
*  But the media's one-sided coverage, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=112.8s)]
*  painting Maccabi fans, these well-known racist soccer hooligans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  chanting genocidal and anti-Arab slogans, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=118.76s)]
*  painting them as the innocent victims, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  has once again proven that our media and our political class [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=124.56s)]
*  deem the suffering of Israelis to be more important [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  than the suffering of Arabs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=130.8s)]
*  The attacks in Amsterdam didn't occur in a vacuum. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=132.6s)]
*  And this erasure of responsibility, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=135.44s)]
*  this coddling of the Israeli far-right, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=138.04000000000002s)]
*  this misuse of words like anti-Semitism and pogrom, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=140.16s)]
*  and this blatant media bias make the racist violence [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=143.76s)]
*  we saw in Amsterdam more likely, not less likely, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=148.08s)]
*  to happen again. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=151.92s)]
*  Joining me now is Annette de Graaf, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=153.44s)]
*  who captured the events in Amsterdam. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  She's a renowned iPhone photographer [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=156.84s)]
*  who's even photographed Tim Cook. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=158.68s)]
*  Annette, thank you so much for joining me on May the Unfiltered. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=160.84s)]
*  You were on the streets of Amsterdam [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=164.36s)]
*  as this chaos took place. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=166.68s)]
*  Can you tell us what you saw and how the events unfolded? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=168.88s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=173.92s)]
*  I was there already at 6 o'clock before the game, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=175.92s)]
*  and that was, well, after some incidents down square. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=179.32s)]
*  And it was pretty quiet, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=185.24s)]
*  so the police guided the supporters to the central station. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=187.6s)]
*  And afterwards, I was thinking like, OK, let's go back at 11. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=194.72s)]
*  So, 11.15, I was there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=200.16s)]
*  Waiting. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=203.92s)]
*  And two groups of supporters came, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=205.92s)]
*  one directly from central station, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=208.92s)]
*  where they also left for the game, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=211.6s)]
*  and the other group was approaching me on the right side. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=214.44s)]
*  And there, you know, I tensed, how do you say, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=219.96s)]
*  some sort of aggression. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=226.84s)]
*  They were definitely up to something, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=228.96s)]
*  so I thought, like, better watch out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=230.84s)]
*  What are they doing, you know? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=234.60000000000002s)]
*  And then they went straight to Domsk Square. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=236.4s)]
*  And when they were at Damarak, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=242.84s)]
*  that's the street between central station and Domsk Square, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=245.36s)]
*  they lit heavily fireworks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  And it was a group of maybe, like, 50 people. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=255.24s)]
*  These are Maccabi fans? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=259.0s)]
*  And these are Maccabi fans you're referring to? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=265.0s)]
*  Yes, Maccabi supporters. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=267.64s)]
*  So, in your view, these people were behaving violently, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  they weren't just minding their own business innocents? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=273.52s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=277.08s)]
*  What was your reaction to seeing outlets like CNN, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=278.56s)]
*  the New York Times and others using your footage of what happened, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=281.28s)]
*  but twisting it to make it look like the Maccabi fans [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=285.56s)]
*  were the victims? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=288.44s)]
*  I was really surprised. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=290.44s)]
*  I was following the group to the whole route, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=293.12s)]
*  I was there for two hours when I came back. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=296.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a war on Twitter, let's say, X. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=299.48s)]
*  And people framed my work, and of course, that's terrible, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=305.52s)]
*  because they told the opposite of what happened in that footage. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=311.96s)]
*  A mainstream leading journalist told the opposite of what happened, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=317.96s)]
*  in your words. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=321.12s)]
*  Sky News in the UK has been accused of misrepresenting your footage as well. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=322.44s)]
*  At first, saying it showed Maccabi fans attacking locals. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=325.64s)]
*  Maccabi fans were seen attacking locals [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=329.84s)]
*  as a police car can be seen driving by. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  And then switching it around and just saying, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=336.12s)]
*  a large group of hooded men striking people at random. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  A video posted on social media shows a large group of hooded men [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=341.47999999999996s)]
*  dressed in black, running down the street and striking people at random. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=346.56s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=351.08s)]
*  And was your footage misused by Sky and others? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, so they invite me to a live show on Friday night. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=355.84s)]
*  That was 30 past nine. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=361.08s)]
*  And I was I really had the feeling that I was in a live show. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=363.79999999999995s)]
*  Later on, I asked Sky News, can I have a link to the episode? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=368.23999999999995s)]
*  And they said, oh, yeah, we find it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=373.2s)]
*  I never received the link to the live show. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=375.72s)]
*  Then I heard in some sort of clip that was my voiceover. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=378.36s)]
*  And the second clip that was a clip of Alice Porter, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  they changed the whole narrative again. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=386.36s)]
*  So, yeah, I was really flabbergasted. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=388.16s)]
*  You've received one apology so far from a news organisation [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  that misused your footage. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=394.8s)]
*  Have any other networks taken accountability? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=395.96000000000004s)]
*  Do you think they will? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=398.68s)]
*  Do you think this will improve reporting practices going forward? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=399.88000000000005s)]
*  Yes, the first apology I received was from Tiger Show. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=404.48s)]
*  And that seemed really cool because first they did a revision, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  a rectification, and then they also said apologies in a broadcast. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=415.56s)]
*  So that was cool. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=424.24s)]
*  But, yeah, from the other platforms like BBC News and Sky News, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=425.8s)]
*  I didn't receive any, you know. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=433.76s)]
*  So that is really frustrating. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=435.64s)]
*  When you see the president of the United States putting out a tweet [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=437.72s)]
*  talking about the victims of anti-Semitism in Amsterdam, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=443.6s)]
*  and there was anti-Semitism, I'm sure, from some of the people, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=447.6s)]
*  there's been reports of people talking about Jew Hunt and others, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=450.6s)]
*  no-one's questioning that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  But the idea that the president of the United States is tweeting [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=455.08s)]
*  about a group of people who he makes sound like they were just [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=457.96s)]
*  minding their own business and they were attacked for being Jewish, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=460.88s)]
*  you're saying that you are an eyewitness who took footage on your [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=464.28s)]
*  phone of these people attacking an Arab taxi driver, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=467.6s)]
*  attacking a Palestinian flag, attacking locals. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=473.2s)]
*  Just to be clear, that's what you saw. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=476.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=479.96s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=482.24s)]
*  It's shocking. It's really shocking. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=483.76s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=486.0s)]
*  I really think it's very dangerous also for our city, you know. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=487.40000000000003s)]
*  We have a city with a large history. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think the game... [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  I think they didn't have to invite the supporters to our city. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=503.44s)]
*  I think that's a mistake. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, these Maccabi fans have a history of saying racist things [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=511.0s)]
*  and doing outrageous things like they did at the weekend. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  You haven't only faced a misrepresentation of your work, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=518.24s)]
*  but according to what I saw on social media, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=521.48s)]
*  you've also dealt with character assassination, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=523.24s)]
*  people attacking you personally. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=525.08s)]
*  Has that been happening since the weekend? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=526.44s)]
*  Yeah, especially the Dutch media. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=528.88s)]
*  The Dutch right-wing media, they are after me right now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=531.24s)]
*  And, well, I'm not scared. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=535.0s)]
*  Not really, because, yes, I have the truth of my footage, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=538.4s)]
*  and that's the only thing, you know. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=541.92s)]
*  Why are they after you? Why do you think they're after you? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=543.48s)]
*  Because the truth is inconvenient. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=548.72s)]
*  They wanted to be about Arab Muslim mobs attacking innocent Jews [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=552.48s)]
*  when it was actually Israeli football hooligans [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=558.8s)]
*  and people violently responding to violent football hooligans. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=561.56s)]
*  Well, let me be clear. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=565.72s)]
*  I can't say things about other incidents, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=567.72s)]
*  because I was not there, I was not witnessing that. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=571.72s)]
*  And it's bad, you know. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=574.72s)]
*  What happened all over is bad. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=576.24s)]
*  But the chaos, of course, existed only by the presence [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=579.72s)]
*  of the Israeli hooligans. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=585.72s)]
*  Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=588.72s)]
*  and the mayor of Amsterdam, among many others, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=590.72s)]
*  have likened the violence at the weekend in Amsterdam [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=592.72s)]
*  to a pogrom against the Jewish people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=595.72s)]
*  Was what you filmed a pogrom? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=598.72s)]
*  Um, no. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=602.72s)]
*  Not at all. Not at all. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=605.72s)]
*  It's even so that the Amsterdam locals, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=608.72s)]
*  the Amsterdam youngsters who were provocative, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=613.72s)]
*  of course, they were present. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=616.72s)]
*  I saw only one Palestinian flag. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=618.72s)]
*  So, of course, there was provocation on one hand to the other, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=622.72s)]
*  but I haven't seen a flag in that whole two hours I was there. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=627.72s)]
*  But what I also witnessed was I got messages in my direct message [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=632.72s)]
*  afterwards from neighbors who lived there, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=638.72s)]
*  and definitely knew that it were Israeli hooligans banging on the doors [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=641.72s)]
*  and shouting, and they were very scared. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=648.72s)]
*  I think that's a shame for my city. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=651.72s)]
*  Last question, Annette. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=655.72s)]
*  What do you think happens to people's faith in the media [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=657.72s)]
*  when you're saying that you saw one thing, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=660.72s)]
*  you photographed and filmed one thing, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=663.72s)]
*  and some of the world's biggest media organizations [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=665.72s)]
*  told their viewers and listeners the exact opposite? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=668.72s)]
*  It's going on for years, so I'm not surprised. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=674.72s)]
*  But it's definitely different when it's your own footage. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=677.72s)]
*  I consume sometimes fake news, but yes, I do your own research. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=680.72s)]
*  But when you are the witness of your own footage [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=685.72s)]
*  and they put it in a totally different perspective, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=689.72s)]
*  yeah, that's very dangerous. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=693.72s)]
*  And, of course, I have the responsibility as a world citizen [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=695.72s)]
*  to do something about it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=699.72s)]
*  Well, Annette, we appreciate you exercising that responsibility [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=701.72s)]
*  and speaking out and correcting all of these major media organizations [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=704.72s)]
*  on your own and facing these threats from the Dutch far right. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=708.72s)]
*  Please do stay safe. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=711.72s)]
*  Thank you for filming what you filmed, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=713.72s)]
*  and thank you for coming on May the Unfiltered today. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=715.72s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjoQkPXA_us&t=717.72s)]
