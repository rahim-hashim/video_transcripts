Video Description: On October 14, 2023, a week after the Hamas attacks on Israel, and just days after Joe Biden falsely claimed he had seen photos of beheaded Israeli babies, a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy called Wadee Alfayoumi was brutally murdered in his home after being stabbed 26 times. His mother, Hanaan Shahin, was also stabbed and left critically injured.

Shahin’s landlord, 71-year-old Joseph Czuba, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, and, crucially, two counts of hate crimes. Czuba pleaded not guilty and faces trial later this month.

On Tuesday, in the wake of a contentious hate crimes hearing in the Senate in which Palestinian voices were not platformed and in which Wadee’s name was barely mentioned, Mehdi Hasan sat down with Shahin and civil rights attorney Maaria Mozaffar, from the Muslim Civic Coalition, for an exclusive interview. They talked about Shahin’s memories of Wadee, the ‘Wadee Act’ in the House and Senate, and her conversations with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.

# Mehdi Hasan interviews Mother of Palestinian-American Child Murdered After Oct. 7
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4)
*  Before I begin this next story, I must warn you it is a difficult one to hear, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=0.0s)]
*  with details that are extremely violent and gruesome. On October the 11th of last year, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=4.16s)]
*  71-year-old landlord Joseph Tuba in Plainfield Township, Illinois, decided he wanted the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=9.6s)]
*  Palestinian family residing in his rental space to move out. You may remember that day because [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=14.8s)]
*  it was when US President Joe Biden falsely claimed seeing pictures of beheaded babies [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=19.92s)]
*  from Hamas's October the 7th attack. There were no such pictures. That Palestinian family, Tuba, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=25.2s)]
*  wanted to evict consisted of mom and dad Odeh El-Fayoumi and Hanan Shaheen, along with their [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=29.92s)]
*  six-year-old son Wadiyah El-Fayoumi. Tuba told his wife Mary he was afraid Shaheen's Palestinian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=34.88s)]
*  friends were going to harm them and was worried about a national day of jihad, both baseless [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=41.28s)]
*  claims of course. Still, Tuba's wife reassured the El-Fayoumi family that they were safe and [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=46.96s)]
*  did not need to move out, adding that if anyone was going to move out, it should be her own [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  husband Joseph. That assurance, however, was short-lived. On Saturday, October the 14th, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=56.0s)]
*  as Shaheen was giving her six-year-old son Wadiyah a bath, she heard a knock on the door, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=63.04s)]
*  where an angry Joseph Tuba waited. Upon answering, the 71-year-old told Shaheen he was angry with her [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=67.6s)]
*  for what was happening in Jerusalem, to which she responded by saying, let's pray for peace. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  Peace, however, was the furthest thing from Tuba's mind. What unfolded after was a crime so ugly, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=78.48s)]
*  so vile, so disgusting, that I truly believe no adjective can sufficiently describe the level of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=84.8s)]
*  its evil. Tuba allegedly attacked Shaheen with a knife, stabbing her several times before she [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  managed to lock herself in a bathroom while she dialed 911, unable to have her son by her side as [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=95.92s)]
*  she did so. With his victim now behind a locked door, Tuba allegedly turned his sights away from [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=101.12s)]
*  the mother and towards her six-year-old son. He then allegedly proceeded to stab the innocent boy [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=106.4s)]
*  26 times. 26. Deputies arriving at the scene later reported finding Tuba sitting on the ground near [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=112.32s)]
*  the family's driveway. Mom, I'm fine. Those were Wadiyah's last words to his mother, according to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=120.08s)]
*  a family friend. He wasn't fine. Nothing about that day, that incident, that crime was fine. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=127.28s)]
*  A mother finding out her son had died while she was being treated for stab wounds from her child's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=134.72s)]
*  killer is not fine. A mother not being able to go to her own son's funeral because she couldn't [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=139.12s)]
*  be discharged from the hospital in time is not fine. A mother seeking justice for her son and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  not finding it so many months later is not fine. Tuba was charged with one count each of first [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  degree murder, attempted murder and aggravated battery, and two counts of a hate crime. He pleaded [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=156.56s)]
*  not guilty and his trial is set for September the 18th, pending the completion of a federal [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=162.08s)]
*  investigation into that case. Wadiyah's father has also filed a wrongful death lawsuit against [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=167.04000000000002s)]
*  Tuba, his wife, and their property management company. Meanwhile, Wadiyah's mother, Hanan Shaheen, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  has been here in Washington DC to attend a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=179.28s)]
*  Hate Crimes in the US where you would think her voice is scheduled to be platformed. It was not. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=183.76000000000002s)]
*  In fact, the announcement for the hearing that was published in May fails to include even one [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=190.24s)]
*  mention of the word Palestine or Palestinian. It's basically all lives matter, despite the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=194.24s)]
*  fact that anti-Semitic hate crimes do rightly merit their own separate hearing, and despite the fact [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  that Wadiyah was killed and his mother was stabbed not just because they were Arab, not just because [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=205.28s)]
*  they were Muslim, but because they were Palestinian. Earlier I sat down with Hanan Shaheen for a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=210.08s)]
*  difficult conversation. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=217.12s)]
*  I'm here in Congress with Mariam Muzaffar, the legislative lead at the Muslim Civic Coalition, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=224.96s)]
*  who helped put together the hearing in Congress today. And I'm also here with Hanan Shaheen, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=228.96s)]
*  Wadiyah's mom. Thank you both for joining us. And let me just begin by saying we are so sorry for [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  your loss, all of us. God bless you. God bless you. I just wanted to start by saying, why are you here? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=239.36s)]
*  Why did you want to come here and offer your support to this hearing? Yes, you know, all my [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  sisters and brothers and humanity and nice people, they want to see an action taken for Wadiyah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=251.2s)]
*  And they want to say, we ever will forget him. We need to seek justice and to pray for peace. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=262.0s)]
*  And that we're gathering as a family. Of course. And last year, it's almost a year now, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=270.32s)]
*  October the 14th, a horrific day for you and your family. What is your memory of that day, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=280.64s)]
*  if you don't mind me asking? What happened that day? How do you recall what happened to your [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=286.96s)]
*  family that day? Yes, it's a sad day. It's a sad day. You don't want to stop at each moment. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=292.0s)]
*  You know, for I put my anger in the investigation on my attorney. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=302.88s)]
*  You know, I don't want to repeat that with nice people like you. And I don't want to bring the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=310.08s)]
*  sadness up. I want to share how much in the six year and one week spending with my child, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=316.64s)]
*  it was so much love, so much fun, so much family warm feeling. That is amazing to remember him [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=325.20000000000005s)]
*  in that way. He just turned six, I believe. Yes. Before this all happened. Yeah, one week. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Tell me, what was Wadiyah like? Well, he was, you know, an inspiring child. I, you know, I said that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=339.12s)]
*  in many meetings, his teacher will be sending me picture recording him in the kindergarten and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=349.76s)]
*  saying, you know, his classmates copy in him as he's acting like a boss. And, you know, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=356.96s)]
*  in younger age, I put him in daycare and his classmates first name was Wadiyah. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=368.72s)]
*  Yeah, first word before they, you know, can say their name, their own name. And, you know, he was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=377.52s)]
*  joyful and, you know, he gave so much love. And we all want to remember him. And Maria, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=388.0s)]
*  the Wadiyah resolution in Congress is all about remembering his name, the tragedy, the crime of [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=397.2s)]
*  what happened to him. What is you were here organizing this hearing in Congress today? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=403.6s)]
*  What is the status of the resolution that was, I think, introduced in the House and the Senate to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=408.48s)]
*  Mark Wadiyah al-Fayoumi's death? Right. It's a resolution introduced by Congresswoman Ramirez [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=412.8s)]
*  in the House. And then it was introduced in the Senate in the March of 2024 by Senator Durbin and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  Senator Duckworth. And it has not moved. Senator Durbin has asked for unanimous adoption. And [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=424.16s)]
*  the key thing about this resolution is that it brings the light to dehumanization. It [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  articulates that dehumanization results from misinformation by elected officials on political [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  rhetoric and connects those dots. And that a child wearing a yarmulke and a child wearing a kafir [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  should have the same protection in our nation. And the resolution explained to our viewers? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=451.12s)]
*  It has not moved. And there have been other legislation that have passed through the House [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=457.12s)]
*  very quickly. So we are very, very cognizant of the reality that for some reason, the uplifting [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=462.48s)]
*  of Wadiyah's story, and perhaps because it is so real and true of what we need to do as a nation [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=471.52s)]
*  to bring people together, that people are uncomfortable pushing the resolution. And we [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=478.08s)]
*  would hope that after this congressional hearing that we saw Wadiyah's photo, people saw Hanan and [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=482.64s)]
*  met her and saw that the killing of Wadiyah was an American story, a Palestinian American story, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=488.08s)]
*  that people would be moved to say, why haven't we heard about Wadiyah earlier in the halls of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  Congress? Why haven't this resolution moved? It's not even binding law. It just uplifts his heritage, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=497.52s)]
*  his community, the Palestinian people, and recognizes that children should have the right [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=502.88s)]
*  to be safe. Hanan, you didn't speak today at the hearing, I know. The hearing became about all hate [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=508.96s)]
*  crimes, not specifically anti-Palestinian hate crimes, which is a shame. What is your message? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=515.36s)]
*  We're in Congressman Ramirez's office right now, I should point out to our viewers who sponsored this [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=521.12s)]
*  resolution. What is your message to people in Congress in Washington, D.C., who haven't moved [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=525.12s)]
*  on this resolution? What do you want them to know about Wadiyah and the importance of remembering [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=530.48s)]
*  Wadiyah? You know, I have this attorney to have answered these things, and you know, I will talk [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=534.08s)]
*  about the nice people who I met there, like Durban, and the people who show care for me, and I'm [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=545.76s)]
*  thankful having the nice people they covered. They, you know, give a good feeling and support [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=554.24s)]
*  to make us continue in our praying for peace and seeking justice way. And the other part, Arona. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=565.84s)]
*  Maria mentioned this is a very American story. Wadiyah was an American child killed in the United [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=577.28s)]
*  States of America. It was a few days after President Biden had talked about beheaded babies. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=581.84s)]
*  A lot of people were very upset in the Palestinian community. Did President Biden reach out to you? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=586.88s)]
*  Have you spoken to the president? Yes, he sent me a letter and filled with kind words and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=591.2800000000001s)]
*  how he told you the nice people are here and sent in their kind words. Like, you know, I spoke to [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=598.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris, and yeah, there is many, many nice people who will, you know, stand in and, you know, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=607.28s)]
*  show care and support. And so President Biden and Vice President Harris reached out to you. Yes. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  Dare I ask, did Donald Trump? I'll take that as a no. Maria, how disappointed are you as someone [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=622.0s)]
*  who pushed for this hearing that it's almost like an all lives matter hearing? We have a [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=629.52s)]
*  Palestinian American child killed. It doesn't merit its own hearing. We've had multiple, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=636.16s)]
*  rightly, multiple hearings on antisemitism, which is a real problem, but we couldn't have one hearing [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=640.4s)]
*  on anti-Palestinian hate. Well, let me say what was visible that maybe you may not be able to see [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=644.4s)]
*  through the Senate live stream. And that is that the whole room was filled with students with [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  kafirs and individuals with kafirs and that Hesham al-Wartani was shot because he was wearing a kafir [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  in Vermont. And it's a very powerful visual. And we had, we were joined by Moe Amer, who's a [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=662.72s)]
*  Palestinian media personality who speaks the truth on these issues. Imam Omar Soleiman, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  very notable figure. And we had them all come in this room because we wanted the community to [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=675.36s)]
*  understand that this is their turf as well. And that Wadaya was Palestinian. So I'm not disappointed [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=679.44s)]
*  in the way that our community showed up. I'm also not disappointed in what we actually saw happen [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=685.44s)]
*  at the hearing, because it was a breaking open of an echo chamber. And it was breaking open of any [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMiUACWb-4&t=693.0400000000001s)]
