Video Description: “We all are sick and tired of having to recount stories of utter horror, of what is going on here, the extent of the suffering that is going on there. And all we hear are words, basically… History will judge what is going on here, and it will not judge us kindly for having ignored it.”

As Israel unrelentingly attacks Gaza, British surgeon Dr. Tom Potokar joins Mehdi Hasan from the heart of the bombardment, at a hospital in Khan Younis.

Deadly Israeli strikes forced Dr. Potokar to relocate from hospital to hospital. He describes the devastation to Mehdi: displacement, starvation, entire families being wiped out, and severely injured children.

# 'Televised Slaughter': UK Doctor on How Devastating It Is in Gaza
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA)
*  The violence in Gaza continues to escalate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=0.0s)]
*  In the last couple of days, Israel has been targeting Khan Yunis, located in southern Gaza. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=2.4s)]
*  On May the 13th, the European Gaza Hospital was hit by an Israeli missile strike. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=6.96s)]
*  That was the only hospital in the Gaza Strip that specialized services such as follow-ups for cancer patients, neurosurgery, cardiovascular surgery. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  In the aftermath of the strike, the hospital was evacuated. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=18.56s)]
*  Patients and equipment were transferred to other hospitals, but hospitals across Gaza are under fire. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=21.2s)]
*  Joining me today is Dr. Tom Patoka, a British plastic surgeon who has conducted burn research and prevention around the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=26.4s)]
*  And he's been in Gaza before, but he's there right now at the Palestine Red Crescent Hospital in Khan Yunis. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=32.88s)]
*  Dr. Patoka, thank you so much for joining us on Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=38.16s)]
*  In the last day, Al Jazeera is reporting that the Israeli military has fired over 30 strikes. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=41.76s)]
*  There have been dozens of casualties. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  You're in one of the hospitals at the heart of all the fighting. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=48.8s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=51.28s)]
*  So, I mean, since the evacuation order came yesterday for a huge swathe of the Khan Yunis region, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=52.16s)]
*  including much of the city right up to directly in front of this hospital, many, many people have left. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=61.76s)]
*  There have been, throughout the day, numerous strikes that you hear. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  It's difficult to predict exactly how close or how far they are. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=74.96s)]
*  Sometimes the windows shudder a bit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=79.36s)]
*  Sometimes it's a bit further away. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=80.32s)]
*  And patients, we have patients, I mean, there's this hospital, the Nassau Hospital, which is the sort of bigger, more comprehensive hospital just down the road, not far away. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=81.84s)]
*  I was there the other day as well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=92.96s)]
*  And we had several mass casualties there, people coming in, all victims of blast injury. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=95.28s)]
*  So with devastating wounds, the traumatic brain injury, with significant limb injuries. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  I've been operating today on a case with a young lad, 16 year old with an open wound and a fracture of the bones in his arm and damage to the nerve there. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=111.11999999999999s)]
*  Two patients, one young child, seven year old with burn injuries, another young woman with burn injuries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=123.52s)]
*  So these are the sort of cases that are coming in at the moment and have been coming in for months now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  The Israelis have not allowed any supplies into Gaza for over two months. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  Food, humanitarian supplies, medicines. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=145.2s)]
*  What is the situation in the hospital you're in? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=147.28s)]
*  What do you have in terms of supplies to treat these women and children? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=148.96s)]
*  So, I mean, we do have supplies here at the moment. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=152.64s)]
*  They're not as much as we would like. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=158.96s)]
*  And particularly, for example, with burns, you really do need a huge amount of dressings to treat burns appropriately. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=161.6s)]
*  And the problem is if you don't have enough, then you risk not such a good outcome. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=170.0s)]
*  There's a higher risk of infection and this, that and the other. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=176.64s)]
*  But no, we at the moment, we do have enough supplies to treat the patients. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=180.0s)]
*  We can't treat them to the standard we would like to or the quality we would like to. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=184.16s)]
*  But we are able to still give, you know, our anesthetists can still give anesthetics. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=190.32s)]
*  We still have supplies to, you know, to fix bones and to suture wounds, etc. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  How long these stocks will last? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=201.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=203.6s)]
*  I know that a large storage area in the hospital in Nasser down the road was hit yesterday as part of a strike. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  And that destroyed a lot of supplies in a WHO storage area, which was full of medical supplies. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, yes, today we have enough. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=220.64s)]
*  Will we have enough tomorrow, the day after? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=224.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=225.92s)]
*  The Israelis have always denied that they target hospitals. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=226.96s)]
*  What's been your experience of working in hospitals under attack in Gaza? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=229.52s)]
*  Well, I have been here many times. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=235.28s)]
*  Last time I was here was in October to December 23. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=237.92s)]
*  And a piece of shrapnel came flying through the window of the accommodation I was staying in within the hospital compound. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=242.24s)]
*  This time I was at the European Gaza Hospital when the strikes occurred again within the hospital compound [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=249.36s)]
*  and caused quite a lot of structural damage inside the hospital. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=257.12s)]
*  No longer any functional water supply, etc. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, I know every time we hear there's there's, you know, reasons given why these attacks are occurring. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=264.4s)]
*  And yes, you know, neither of those were directly hitting the main building full of patients. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=270.0s)]
*  No, but they were within the hospital compound and therefore, you know, created severe damage. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=277.36s)]
*  And I think also perhaps the type of weaponry meant that the attacks were not so severe. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=284.08s)]
*  I think that there was a little less damage to the hospital than there might have been if it had been other types of weapons. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=290.8s)]
*  But, you know, there's undoubtedly we've seen it in the Indonesian hospital in the north today. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=297.28000000000003s)]
*  And the last few days we saw it was Shifa. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=302.24s)]
*  We've seen it with NASA before. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  This hospital in the past has been surrounded, has been heavily targeted. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=306.88000000000005s)]
*  We know that the ambulance crews risk their lives every time they go out. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=311.36s)]
*  They're getting shot at. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=316.0s)]
*  The vehicles are being targeted. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=317.12s)]
*  There's no doubt that health care is absolutely in the front line of fire in this conflict. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=319.44s)]
*  And you have obviously been around the world, not just Gaza, where you've offered your services. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  How does Gaza compare to other conflicts that you've visited or that you're all know of? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=331.44s)]
*  You'll be supporting fearless independent journalism. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=349.92s)]
*  I mean, it's difficult for it to compare. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=356.72s)]
*  I mean, some of the injury types are the same in that blast injury does cause, you know, devastating injury. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=359.2s)]
*  It rips flesh off and, you know, tears limbs apart, etc. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=366.16s)]
*  I think the main difference with Gaza and many other places that I've worked in conflict is the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=370.72s)]
*  intensity and the extent of it confined in such a small area. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=378.23999999999995s)]
*  We have to consider that, you know, there's nearly two million people in a very, very small strip of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=381.59999999999997s)]
*  very built up urban sprawl, if you like. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=386.71999999999997s)]
*  There are a few rural areas, but there's a lot of urban areas. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=390.32s)]
*  And, you know, using explosive ordnance in built up areas, housing, you know, thousands of people [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=393.35999999999996s)]
*  causes untold damage. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=401.76s)]
*  And also, of course, you see that, you know, with in comparison to say, Ukraine, you know, Ukraine, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=404.24s)]
*  there is a huge, huge country. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=410.56s)]
*  And, you know, yes, there's an awful bloody conflict going on there as well. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=414.24s)]
*  But there's large areas of the country that, you know, that are not directly affected most of the time. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=418.48s)]
*  Whereas Gaza, it's the whole it's the whole strip and it's endless. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=424.08s)]
*  And people have nowhere to get out to. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=429.68s)]
*  There's no crossing a border to try and escape, get somewhere else. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=432.24s)]
*  They are absolutely trapped in here and trapped with ordnance pouring down on them constantly. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=436.08s)]
*  You were recently quoted as saying, I believe, if Cambodia was the killing fields, then Gaza now is [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=441.76s)]
*  the slaughterhouse. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=446.72s)]
*  Do you want to elaborate on that for our viewers? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=448.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is, as I say, people are trapped within a very, very small square kilometer, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=452.64s)]
*  square kilometers of land. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=462.4s)]
*  I don't know the exact, you know, it's maybe 35 miles by eight or something. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=463.52s)]
*  You know, it is a very small strip of land. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  Anyone can look at a map and see that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=469.52s)]
*  And the density of population is absolutely enormous. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=471.52s)]
*  And the amount of, as I say, ordnance dropping down from the air, from the sea, from artillery, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  from tanks, from helicopter gunships is enormous. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=481.67999999999995s)]
*  And we see it every day. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  The statistics, 100 killed, 150 killed, 70 killed. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=487.68s)]
*  This is like a slaughterhouse. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=492.16s)]
*  People are just being wiped out. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  Whole families are being wiped out, you know, one after the other. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=495.92s)]
*  We constantly have patients who come in and sometimes they have to go straight to surgery [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=500.16s)]
*  and they have no idea that their whole family has been killed. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=506.16s)]
*  You know, this is the reality of what is happening here. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=511.92s)]
*  Well, I hate to ask this, but just so people understand how bad it is, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=515.84s)]
*  what is the most horrific case that you've personally seen or treated? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=519.44s)]
*  I mean, I think for me, whenever I see injuries in children, that is absolutely awful. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=526.8000000000001s)]
*  Particularly when you see burns in children or amputations in children, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  you know, these are really awful because you know that these are absolutely just [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=542.2399999999999s)]
*  innocent victims and it is nothing to do with them. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=547.3599999999999s)]
*  But in terms of the actual physical horrors, if you like, yes, I mean, I operated on a young man [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=551.52s)]
*  the other week who, you know, his right leg was disarticulated at the hip. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  That means, you know, there wasn't even a hip joint, that whole leg had gone. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  His left leg was amputated just below the knee but had huge open wounds, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=569.36s)]
*  shrapnel wounds above that which were full of pus. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=574.64s)]
*  They even have maggots in and he's going to require a further amputation above the knee [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=578.88s)]
*  and possibly even a disarticulation on that side. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=583.76s)]
*  He was also missing his left arm. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=586.64s)]
*  You know, these are absolutely brutal, horrific injuries. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=589.92s)]
*  And in addition to all the injuries and the violence, we of course have [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=594.88s)]
*  the people are starving, malnourished, the blockage of food. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=599.2800000000001s)]
*  The UN humanitarian chief warns that thousands of children could die [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=602.96s)]
*  in the coming days if the Gaza Strip is not flooded with aid. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=606.48s)]
*  What's been your experience seeing people there struggling, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=610.4000000000001s)]
*  ordinary people, with the food situation? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I mean, there's absolutely no question there is massive hunger here. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=618.4000000000001s)]
*  There's massive undernutrition. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=622.48s)]
*  You know, you don't need to be a sort of specialist to identify that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=624.48s)]
*  You can just see it in the people walking around, in the patients that come in. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, there's not an ounce of fat on them. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=634.0s)]
*  There's skin and bones, a lot of them. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  Same with this of all age groups. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  And people are tired because they're hungry, they're anemic, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  meaning they don't have enough blood because they're not forming the blood [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=649.2s)]
*  because they're not getting all the substances they need from a balanced diet. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=651.84s)]
*  They're much more prone to infection. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=658.24s)]
*  The wounds aren't healing. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=660.88s)]
*  I have colleagues that I've known for years who are barely recognisable [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=662.72s)]
*  because they've lost so much weight and people are standing around. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=666.0s)]
*  And yes, they look like the images you see. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=669.36s)]
*  And we've seen over the years from other countries where famine exists, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=672.64s)]
*  people are starving here. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=675.84s)]
*  And for anyone to say otherwise is just nonsense. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=678.16s)]
*  What is your message, Dr. Patoka, to your British citizen, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=683.04s)]
*  to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, to world leaders, Western leaders? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=686.56s)]
*  What is your message to them right now, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=690.4s)]
*  someone who's in Gaza on the ground seeing it with his own two eyes? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=691.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, you know, I have been asked to give many interviews [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=698.16s)]
*  over the last 10 days or so, two weeks. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=703.4399999999999s)]
*  And previously when I was here last time, nothing has really changed. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=706.16s)]
*  And I am getting very sick and tired of having, as are all my colleagues, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=710.0s)]
*  of having to go on to the news programmes because journalists aren't allowed in, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=715.36s)]
*  et cetera, to point out what is happening here. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  And I'm, as we all are, sick and tired of having to recount stories of utter horror, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=723.76s)]
*  of, you know, what is going on here, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  of the extent of the suffering that is going on here. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  And all we hear are words, basically, you know, different leaders saying, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=736.0s)]
*  you know, we don't approve of this, this needs to stop. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  But that's not followed up with any action whatsoever. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, and what is needed to stop this is not words, but it's action. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=750.96s)]
*  That's what's needed. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=755.84s)]
*  People taking some decisive action against what is becoming a, you know, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=757.36s)]
*  I think this is a televised slaughter that we are seeing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=763.44s)]
*  And, you know, history will judge what is going on here [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=768.24s)]
*  and it will not judge us kindly for having ignored it. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=772.08s)]
*  Well, it will judge you kindly, Dr. Padoka. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=775.5200000000001s)]
*  Thank you for all that you do. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=777.5200000000001s)]
*  And I understand how sick and tired you must be of having to do these interviews, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=778.72s)]
*  but we appreciate you getting the voice out and doing what you do. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  Please do try and stay safe in what is a very unsafe place. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=784.96s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=788.32s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=789.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=791.5200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDifx01tWjA&t=791.92s)]
