# ‘Justice for Palestinians Means Justice for Israelis’: Exclusive Interview With Jamaal Bowman
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [September 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg)
*  Welcome to Mehdi Unfiltered here in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Mehdi Hassan. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2.64s)]
*  On today's show, I speak to former Palestinian negotiator [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=3.84s)]
*  Deanna Butu on what could be the largest protest [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=6.4s)]
*  in Israel's history. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=9.08s)]
*  But first, we must address the elephant and donkey in the room [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=10.68s)]
*  and talk about the presidential debate this week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  I'll be giving my take on what went down in Philadelphia. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=16.76s)]
*  Plus, I'll be joined by New York Congressman Jamal Bowman [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=19.28s)]
*  on what was a very different debate for the Democrats [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=22.12s)]
*  this time around with a lot more pet talk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=24.76s)]
*  Plus, whatever happened to Jamal Bowman in his primary? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=27.96s)]
*  And AIPAC. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=30.64s)]
*  Lots to discuss. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=31.8s)]
*  So what are we waiting for? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=33.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=34.24s)]
*  Ranting, raving, lying, deflecting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=41.04s)]
*  Donald Trump was at his very worst on the Philadelphia [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  debate stage on Tuesday night. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=47.32s)]
*  If Joe Biden's debate performance in June, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=49.28s)]
*  embarrassingly incoherent, was considered [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=51.92s)]
*  to be the worst presidential debate performance ever [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=54.68s)]
*  and forced him to step down from the race, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=57.44s)]
*  then surely Donald Trump's debate performance on Tuesday night, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  not just embarrassingly incoherent, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  but shamelessly dishonest and unconnected from reality, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=64.52s)]
*  should force him to step down from the race too. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=68.28s)]
*  But no, that'll never happen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=70.96s)]
*  Number one, because Trump is shameless. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=72.8s)]
*  Number two, his party is full of cowards. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=75.36s)]
*  They don't have a Nancy Pelosi to push him out. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=77.28s)]
*  And number three, our media continues [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=79.92s)]
*  to grade him on a curve. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=81.88s)]
*  Yes, the New York Times on Wednesday morning [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=83.8s)]
*  on its home page summarised the debate as, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=85.56s)]
*  in fierce debate, Harris-Bates are defensive Trump. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=87.88s)]
*  Not just defensive Trump, dishonest Trump, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=91.68s)]
*  deluded Trump, deranged Trump. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=94.48s)]
*  But they'll never say that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=97.04s)]
*  The debate was more than an hour and a half long on ABC, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  and pretty much every pundit, focus group, insta-poll agrees [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=101.12s)]
*  that Harris won and Trump lost. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=104.4s)]
*  Even Trump's loyalists know he lost [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=106.64s)]
*  because they're busy being snowflakes, whining [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=108.28s)]
*  and complaining that the moderators were biased. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=110.6s)]
*  Winners don't complain about the moderators. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=114.32s)]
*  But what do we actually learn of value, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  of importance from this debate? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=118.96s)]
*  Here are five things I think we learned that mattered. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=121.36s)]
*  Number one, Donald Trump is unfit for high office, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=124.88s)]
*  for any office. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  He didn't just lie shamelessly, brazenly, repeatedly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=129.68s)]
*  For example, in this exchange on Covid... [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=133.16s)]
*  We had the greatest economy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=135.68s)]
*  We got hit with a pandemic. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  And the pandemic was not since 1917, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=138.76s)]
*  where 100 million people died. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=142.04s)]
*  Has there been anything like it? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=143.92s)]
*  We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=145.16s)]
*  We handed them over a country where the economy [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=147.76s)]
*  and where the stock market was higher [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=151.48s)]
*  than it was before the pandemic came in. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=153.28s)]
*  Nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=155.88s)]
*  We made ventilators for the entire world. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=157.96s)]
*  We got gowns, we got masks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  We did things that nobody thought possible. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=162.2s)]
*  And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  They give me credit for a lot of things, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=166.92s)]
*  but not enough credit for the great job [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=168.92s)]
*  we did with the pandemic. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=170.64s)]
*  To be clear, his leadership during the pandemic [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=171.96s)]
*  was perhaps the worst in the world. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=173.96s)]
*  He suggested people put disinfectant in their arms. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  And he may have sent ventilators abroad, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=178.08s)]
*  but he didn't have enough here at home. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=179.88s)]
*  As for gowns, doctors and nurses in America [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=181.56s)]
*  had to wear trash bags while bodies piled up [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=183.72s)]
*  in New York streets. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  But he didn't just lie shamelessly about things like Covid. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  He also engaged in the worst, most racist, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  most deranged conspiracy theories. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=193.44s)]
*  What they have done to our country [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=195.96s)]
*  by allowing these millions and millions of people [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=197.68s)]
*  to come into our country and look at what's happening [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=200.56s)]
*  to the towns all over the United States. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=203.24s)]
*  And a lot of towns don't want to talk. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=205.72s)]
*  It's not going to be Aurora or Springfield. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=207.0s)]
*  A lot of towns don't want to talk about it [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=209.12s)]
*  because they're so embarrassed by it. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=210.8s)]
*  In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=212.76s)]
*  the people that came in. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=216.04s)]
*  They're eating the cats. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=217.4s)]
*  They're eating the pets of the people that live there. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=218.76s)]
*  And this is what's happening in our country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=224.6s)]
*  And it's a shame. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=227.12s)]
*  Yes, in 2024, the Republican nominee [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=228.12s)]
*  for president of the United States lathered in bronzer, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=230.32s)]
*  stood up on a live television debate stage [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=233.52s)]
*  and shouted about migrants eating your pets. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=235.68s)]
*  They might as well just have nominated Alex Jones [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=239.4s)]
*  to be their candidate or A.N. Other Internet troll. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  Number two, it's too easy to bait Donald Trump. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=245.76s)]
*  Just too easy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=249.16s)]
*  People like me said Harris should bait Trump. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=250.44s)]
*  The Harris team briefed NBC News the week before the debate [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=252.96s)]
*  that they planned to bait Trump. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=255.6s)]
*  And Trump's people told Trump not to get baited. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  But the thin-skinned man child that he is, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  he just couldn't stop himself. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=263.16s)]
*  He took the bait every time. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=265.0s)]
*  I'm going to actually do something really unusual, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=267.68s)]
*  and I'm going to invite you to attend [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=269.68s)]
*  one of Donald Trump's rallies, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  because it's a really interesting thing to watch. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=273.32s)]
*  You will see during the course of his rallies, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=277.88s)]
*  He will talk about windmills cause cancer. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=281.44s)]
*  And what you will also notice [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=284.64s)]
*  is that people start leaving his rallies early, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=286.0s)]
*  out of exhaustion and boredom. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=288.76s)]
*  And I will tell you, the one thing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=290.96s)]
*  you will not hear him talk about is you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=292.24s)]
*  You will not hear him talk about your needs, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=294.88s)]
*  your dreams, and your desires. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=296.84s)]
*  And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve a president [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=299.52s)]
*  who actually puts you first, and I pledge to you that I will. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=303.0s)]
*  It's that Harris ding of his rallies [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=306.64s)]
*  that provoked the orange narcissist [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=309.36s)]
*  to make his crazy claim about migrants eating pets. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=311.24s)]
*  Yes, his response to Harris saying [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  he says crazy stuff at his rallies [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=317.88s)]
*  was to say crazy stuff at the debate. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=320.0s)]
*  Stable genius. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=322.48s)]
*  He's a stable genius. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=324.04s)]
*  Number three, you can fact check Donald Trump in a debate. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  We were told it couldn't be done. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=329.92s)]
*  It was against the rules. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=331.32s)]
*  Trump is too hard to stop in his tracks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=332.68s)]
*  Not true. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  On Tuesday, ABC News moderators David Muir and Lindsay Davis, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=336.24s)]
*  on multiple occasions, stepped in to fact check Trump's lies [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=339.44s)]
*  about Democrats killing babies after they're born, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=343.68s)]
*  or immigrants eating cats in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=346.08s)]
*  or whether or not Trump won or lost the 2020 election. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=349.12s)]
*  Spoiler alert, he lost. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  So, American journalists, stop making excuses. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  Fact check Trump every time. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=357.68s)]
*  Oh, and for the people on the right saying, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=360.36s)]
*  well, why did they only fact check Trump? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=362.24s)]
*  Because Trump was the only one telling dozens [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=364.84s)]
*  and dozens of demonstrable, ridiculous lies. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=367.2s)]
*  Number four, Trump doesn't know anything. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=371.56s)]
*  He can't talk about policy. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  His rants about tariffs, about other countries [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=376.56s)]
*  supposedly paying for tariffs, they don't, we do, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=379.08s)]
*  exposed him as a liar and an ignoramus. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=382.32s)]
*  And when he was asked about his position on healthcare, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=386.0s)]
*  on replacing Obamacare, which he has been promising a plan on [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=388.12s)]
*  for years now, but never revealing one, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=390.91999999999996s)]
*  this is what happened. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=393.64s)]
*  I had a choice to make. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=394.68s)]
*  Do I save it and make it as good as it can be, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=396.28s)]
*  or do I let it rot and I saved it? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=399.48s)]
*  I did the right thing, but it's still never going to be great [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=401.84s)]
*  and it's too expensive for people. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=406.0s)]
*  And what we will do is we're looking at different plans. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=408.12s)]
*  If we can come up with a plan that's gonna cost our people, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=411.6s)]
*  our population less money and be better healthcare [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=415.24s)]
*  than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=418.76s)]
*  But until then, I'd run it as good as it can be run. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=422.04s)]
*  So just a yes or no, you still do not have a plan. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  I have concepts of a plan. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=427.72s)]
*  I have the concepts of a plan. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=429.8s)]
*  You can't make this shit up. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=432.20000000000005s)]
*  So surely you can't put a village idiot like Donald Trump [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=434.48s)]
*  in charge of a school board, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  let alone the US federal government and, you know, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=440.12s)]
*  the nuclear codes. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=442.72s)]
*  And number five, sadly, neither of our two parties [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=445.32000000000005s)]
*  give a damn about Palestinian lives and nor does our media. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=449.32000000000005s)]
*  The section on Gaza at the debate was belated, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=453.16s)]
*  brief and filled with lazy, canned talking points [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=456.6s)]
*  from both candidates. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=460.24s)]
*  Harris saying, two-state solution. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=461.44s)]
*  Trump saying, Iran's to blame. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=463.4s)]
*  It even turned into a competition about [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=465.6s)]
*  who loves Israel more. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=467.52s)]
*  She hates Israel. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=469.32s)]
*  If she's president, I believe that Israel will not exist [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=470.76s)]
*  within two years from now. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=474.4s)]
*  And I've been pretty good at predictions [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=475.8s)]
*  and I hope I'm wrong about that one. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=477.24s)]
*  She hates Israel. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=479.28s)]
*  At the same time, in her own way, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=480.6s)]
*  she hates the Arab population [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=482.96s)]
*  because the whole place is gonna get blown up. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  Arabs, Jewish people, Israel. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=489.52000000000004s)]
*  Israel will be gone. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=492.92s)]
*  Vice President Harris, he says you hate Israel. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=494.76s)]
*  That's absolutely not true. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=497.8s)]
*  I have my entire career and life supported Israel [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=499.52000000000004s)]
*  and the Israeli people. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=503.6s)]
*  He knows that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=504.96000000000004s)]
*  He's trying to, again, divide and distract from the reality. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=506.04s)]
*  You might think the moderators, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=511.16s)]
*  who had done a pretty decent job up until then, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=512.32s)]
*  might have asked about the American citizen [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=514.88s)]
*  who was just killed in the occupied West Bank [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=516.64s)]
*  by US armed Israeli forces. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=519.2s)]
*  But they didn't. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=521.6800000000001s)]
*  You might think the two candidates [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=523.12s)]
*  might have something to say about that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=524.2800000000001s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=526.36s)]
*  When it comes to Gaza and presidential debate, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=527.44s)]
*  I can't help but think of that old Noam Chomsky quote. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=529.76s)]
*  The smart way to keep people passive and obedient [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=532.64s)]
*  is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  but allow very lively debate within that spectrum. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=539.52s)]
*  Well, we certainly had a lively debate [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=543.6s)]
*  and Trump certainly lost that debate. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=546.2s)]
*  But will he lose the election? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  In any other country, the media would demand [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=552.24s)]
*  he stand down after last night. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=553.9200000000001s)]
*  His party would push for him to stand down. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=555.24s)]
*  His voters would be abandoning him in droves. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=557.48s)]
*  But not in America in 2024. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=561.84s)]
*  It just doesn't matter. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=564.96s)]
*  And that is the single biggest tragedy [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=566.9200000000001s)]
*  of our current dark political moment. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=570.24s)]
*  Joining me now from the great state of New York, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=573.84s)]
*  Congressman Jamal Bowman, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=575.84s)]
*  who is a progressive Democrat, member of the squad. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=577.32s)]
*  A supporter, I think it's fair to say, of Kamala Harris, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  but a progressive supporter of Kamala Harris. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  Congressman also, rather famously, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=585.36s)]
*  lost his seat sadly in the primary early the summer [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=587.84s)]
*  after AIPAC dumped, I think, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=590.16s)]
*  over $14 million in that race. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, way more than that. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=593.32s)]
*  All right, well we're gonna talk about the race. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=594.36s)]
*  Let's start with the debate. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=595.88s)]
*  Big moment of the week. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=597.28s)]
*  What was your reaction? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=598.12s)]
*  Did you watch Harris-Trump? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=599.44s)]
*  It was very different to Trump-Biden. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=600.64s)]
*  I think it's better. Very different. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=602.76s)]
*  Trump is a scary embarrassment to himself [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=604.64s)]
*  and to everything the Republican Party currently represents. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=608.88s)]
*  I mean, he's talking about eating cats and dogs [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=612.68s)]
*  and all kinds of stuff. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=614.76s)]
*  Never tells the truth, always misleads. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=617.7199999999999s)]
*  So I thought he got crushed in the debate. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=620.04s)]
*  And I think the VP left a lot on the table. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=621.9599999999999s)]
*  She could have called him out on his trillion dollar tax cuts. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=624.8s)]
*  She could have called him out on so many other issues. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=627.56s)]
*  But I think she still clearly won the debate. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=630.16s)]
*  More about less substance in policy [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=633.88s)]
*  than I wanted to hear about. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=637.04s)]
*  I wanted to hear more about child tax credit. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=638.12s)]
*  I wanted to hear more about her vision [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=640.48s)]
*  for a progressive America going forward. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=642.3199999999999s)]
*  Didn't hear enough about that. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=645.92s)]
*  But overall, I think she won. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=647.16s)]
*  Difficult to do that in a debate [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=648.8s)]
*  because they've got to ask the same question to both. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=650.24s)]
*  And Trump knows nothing about policy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=651.64s)]
*  When he was asked one simple policy question, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=653.28s)]
*  what will you replace Obamacare with? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=656.04s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=657.88s)]
*  I mean, he could not answer the question. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=659.12s)]
*  So he's got the... [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=663.56s)]
*  It was just embarrassing to see him talk. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=665.12s)]
*  Part of me was shouting at the television saying, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=667.3199999999999s)]
*  you know when they asked about NATO and he said Houthis, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  like ask him what a Houthi is. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=672.12s)]
*  Ask him what NATO stands for. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=674.24s)]
*  I would love to see one day an interview with Trump [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=676.8399999999999s)]
*  where you just ask basic fact questions. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=678.76s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=680.4s)]
*  What's the capital of Rwanda? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=681.24s)]
*  But it's scary because this guy was president, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=682.8s)]
*  And the polling is neck and neck. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=685.52s)]
*  He could be president again, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=687.2800000000001s)]
*  even though he ended with an insurrection, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=689.12s)]
*  he's indicted, convicted. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=690.84s)]
*  And he's older, dumber, more incoherent than he was. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=691.96s)]
*  Talking about eating cats and dogs. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=694.4000000000001s)]
*  So it's scary and I hope that the VP wins [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=696.2s)]
*  and it brings an opportunity for fresh thinking, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=701.2s)]
*  a paradigm shift and really pushing on the policies [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=705.0s)]
*  that we've left on the table for quite some time. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=707.48s)]
*  There was criticism from the media, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=710.2s)]
*  some of it I think in bad faith, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  that we don't have enough policies [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=713.64s)]
*  coming from Kamala Harris [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=716.76s)]
*  and then she published a policy plan [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=718.08s)]
*  and people are like, oh, it's Joe Biden's plan, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=719.48s)]
*  it's just been redone. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=721.28s)]
*  I mean, put aside the bad faith media criticisms [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=723.12s)]
*  because Hillary Clinton had loads of policies, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  didn't help her with the media. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=726.76s)]
*  What from a progressive good faith point of view [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  would you want her to be talking about? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=731.6s)]
*  You mentioned child tax credit. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=733.24s)]
*  What else would you have liked to have seen from her last night [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=734.08s)]
*  or in her interview with CNN? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=736.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if she's doing any more interviews, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=737.16s)]
*  she hasn't done many. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=738.4s)]
*  I mean, we can double down on the child tax credit, right? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=739.24s)]
*  Making the child tax credit permanent [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=742.04s)]
*  will lift 50% of children out of poverty. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=745.16s)]
*  That will be transformational for those children, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=748.08s)]
*  for those families, for our education system, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=750.08s)]
*  for our economy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=752.52s)]
*  My background is education, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=753.8s)]
*  so I'm very biased in that space. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=754.88s)]
*  So that's one area. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=756.64s)]
*  She spoke about affordable housing [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=757.84s)]
*  and her plan a little bit to build affordable housing. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=759.8s)]
*  I wanna hear more about that, talk about the need, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=762.68s)]
*  talk about Wall Street predators [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=765.16s)]
*  and affordable housing space and the problem with that [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=767.12s)]
*  and talk about corporate taxes and taxes on the wealthy [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=769.68s)]
*  and make sure they contribute their fair share. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=773.56s)]
*  Yes, a lot of this is Biden, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=775.52s)]
*  but a lot of this has been part of the democratic platform [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=776.92s)]
*  for quite some time. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=779.8s)]
*  We just haven't done enough in the house [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=781.04s)]
*  or the Senate to implement it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=783.24s)]
*  Certainly in the Senate, Joe mentioned [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=784.52s)]
*  was a block on the child tax credit. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=786.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=787.56s)]
*  That'll be the first line of his obit. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=789.8s)]
*  He helped push 50% of American children to poverty. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=791.4s)]
*  I think that's fair to say. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=793.72s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=794.8s)]
*  And he'll never live that down. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=795.64s)]
*  Let me talk to you about [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=796.84s)]
*  one issue that came up at the... [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=798.88s)]
*  Well, immigration was hanging over the entire debate. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=800.68s)]
*  And what Harris did so well, I thought at the beginning, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=803.4s)]
*  which is the best way to stop people like Trump, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=805.88s)]
*  who are propagandists, which is she identified... [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=807.64s)]
*  Right at the start, she said, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=809.5999999999999s)]
*  this is what he's gonna do all night. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=810.5999999999999s)]
*  Whatever you ask him, he's gonna bring it back to immigration. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=811.5999999999999s)]
*  And he then did exactly that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=813.3199999999999s)]
*  But then when they got to the actual bespoke immigration segment, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=815.12s)]
*  she had her talking point, which is, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=817.5999999999999s)]
*  we had this bipartisan bill that Joe Biden signed off on [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=819.48s)]
*  with James Lankford, Republican Senator from Oklahoma, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=822.36s)]
*  and Republicans stopped it because Trump told them to. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=825.08s)]
*  And it's a good talking point. It makes sense. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=828.24s)]
*  But take out Trump and the Republicans. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=830.72s)]
*  The bill itself was a horrific bill. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=832.44s)]
*  Was it not? Am I right in saying that? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=834.2800000000001s)]
*  It was not a bill that progressives supported. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=836.08s)]
*  Draconian. Yes. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=838.2s)]
*  It gave a future president, including a Trump, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=839.36s)]
*  the right to basically shut down the border, end asylum, legal asylum. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=841.2s)]
*  This has been part of my frustration [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=844.44s)]
*  with being in Congress. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=846.12s)]
*  It seems like whenever we do, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=847.12s)]
*  or try to do a transformative piece of legislation, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=849.12s)]
*  it has to include something like 1,000 more police [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=851.4000000000001s)]
*  or another billion to Israel, or tax cuts for corporations. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=854.56s)]
*  You know, we gave corporations tens of billions of dollars [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=858.28s)]
*  in tax cuts and lifted a few children out of poverty. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=860.56s)]
*  That's how this place has worked. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=863.6s)]
*  That's how it definitely works under Republicans. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=865.36s)]
*  Democrats have to do better if we get back in there and get power. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=868.4s)]
*  But yes, it was not a bill that progressives supported, by and large. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=871.04s)]
*  It would be nice if a Democratic leader, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=875.04s)]
*  presidential candidate, spokesperson, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=878.12s)]
*  especially the vice president who's running for election, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=880.72s)]
*  who's running for the White House, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=883.8s)]
*  is the child of immigrants [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=885.4s)]
*  could actually make a positive case, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=887.6s)]
*  unashamed, not defensive, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=890.68s)]
*  just a case for why immigration is a good thing, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=893.08s)]
*  why migrants are net contributors, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=895.36s)]
*  rather than always accepting the Republican framing [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=897.64s)]
*  that it's a problem, they're a threat, we need to crack down. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=900.36s)]
*  Yeah, it would be... [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=903.4399999999999s)]
*  That would be nice. It would be refreshing. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=904.8s)]
*  It would be truthful and accurate. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  We can talk about our impact in Central and South America [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=909.84s)]
*  over the years that has contributed to mass migration. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=913.36s)]
*  We can talk about the impact of climate change or mass migration, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=916.64s)]
*  not just here, but all over the world. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=919.3199999999999s)]
*  We can talk about the need for more social services at the border, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=921.4s)]
*  more legal representation, more social workers [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=924.8399999999999s)]
*  to help streamline the process. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=927.3199999999999s)]
*  But we don't do that. We get defensive, right? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=930.12s)]
*  And, again, that was last night. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=932.56s)]
*  That's generally the case. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  My hope is, and I'm always a hopeful guy, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=937.76s)]
*  going forward post-election, she wins, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  is that we must now have a responsibility [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=944.0s)]
*  to help facilitate new conversations [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=946.0s)]
*  and new thinking and new ideas. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=947.84s)]
*  We cannot be the same old America. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=949.1600000000001s)]
*  One place we need some new thinking and new ideas, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=951.24s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, is our Middle East policy, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=953.36s)]
*  which is the same old same old. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=955.48s)]
*  Decades and decades of bipartisan support for Israel, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=957.0400000000001s)]
*  no matter what, even when they're killing American citizens, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=960.2800000000001s)]
*  as they've just done. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  No mention at the debate last night [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=963.76s)]
*  of an American citizen killed, gunned down by the IDF, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=965.1600000000001s)]
*  by the Israeli military. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=967.5600000000001s)]
*  What did you make of the Israel segment of the debate, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=969.36s)]
*  and what's the difference between the Israeli and the Israeli? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=971.96s)]
*  It's... [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=974.28s)]
*  Another thing that's been very frustrating for me [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=975.76s)]
*  while I've been here in Congress, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=979.12s)]
*  there's nothing wrong with good faith criticism [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=981.4399999999999s)]
*  of your friend in any context, right? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=984.68s)]
*  So Israel's an ally, they're our friend in the Middle East, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=987.64s)]
*  we support their right to exist, all that stuff, right? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=990.6s)]
*  And we need to end the occupation, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=993.08s)]
*  end settlement expansion, hold them accountable, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=995.68s)]
*  stop detaining children, and right now stop the genocide [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=997.72s)]
*  of babies and innocent people. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1000.88s)]
*  We can say those things. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1002.6s)]
*  We can also say, if you continue, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  we will not send you any more arms. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1006.0400000000001s)]
*  And guess what? You know what they're gonna do? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1008.24s)]
*  They're gonna stop killing babies, right? [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1009.84s)]
*  And so I've been, especially this past year, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  like, just blown away by just the unequivocal support, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1014.88s)]
*  no matter what. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1018.76s)]
*  It's almost like a complete erasure of the Palestinian people. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1019.96s)]
*  It's definitely a dehumanization, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1024.0s)]
*  but it's a complete erasure. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1026.3600000000001s)]
*  So we have to be able to think out of both sides of our brain [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1028.1599999999999s)]
*  and walk and chew gum at the same time [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1031.76s)]
*  and center the conversations on human rights. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1033.96s)]
*  The problem is, and the challenge is, as you know, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1036.6399999999999s)]
*  AIPAC and lobbies like AIPAC have so much power [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1039.28s)]
*  and control over our government, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  and that maintains the problem. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1045.76s)]
*  So, before we come to AIPAC and your own race, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1047.72s)]
*  just on Harris Trump, if you are a progressive, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1050.3999999999999s)]
*  you are a young person, you are a person of colour [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1054.6s)]
*  who cares about foreign people, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1057.04s)]
*  you are a Palestinian-American, a Muslim-American, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1059.0s)]
*  Arab-American, especially in somewhere like Michigan, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1061.4s)]
*  and you watched last night's debate, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1063.88s)]
*  and you saw Harris and Trump argue over who loves Israel more [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1065.48s)]
*  and no-one saying they're gonna hold Israel to account [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1067.88s)]
*  or stop the genocide. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1069.64s)]
*  What would you say to that person who says, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1071.6000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, why would I vote for either of them? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1073.5600000000002s)]
*  They're both equally bad on this subject. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1075.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1077.5600000000002s)]
*  First, I would say I understand completely, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1078.88s)]
*  because you have been made to feel invisible [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1081.16s)]
*  and have been erased, so I understand. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1084.36s)]
*  What I would nudge a little bit on is, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1087.36s)]
*  I think we can move things more in a positive direction [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1089.76s)]
*  with President Harris than we can with President Trump. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1092.8799999999999s)]
*  I feel pretty strongly about that. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1096.24s)]
*  I mean, even her rhetoric at her, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1099.0s)]
*  when she accepted the nomination at the convention, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1101.0s)]
*  was different than we would ever hear Trump say [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1104.8s)]
*  about Palestinians and ceasefire and all of that, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1106.8799999999999s)]
*  different than what we've heard President Biden say. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1109.3999999999999s)]
*  She was the first to say ceasefire. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1111.36s)]
*  Now, right now, it's rhetoric. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1113.8s)]
*  But that rhetoric came from the uncommitted movement, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1115.44s)]
*  people like me and others who have been screaming [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1120.3200000000002s)]
*  from the mountaintops about this issue. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1122.4s)]
*  So, rhetoric is often the first step. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1123.8s)]
*  When she gets in, God willing, I hope she does, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  we have to continue to fight and push her and all of Congress [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1130.1200000000001s)]
*  and in state houses and county and locally. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1134.88s)]
*  Because in my race, and I know we're gonna get to that, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1137.68s)]
*  because the governor left October 7th, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1140.28s)]
*  the governor, the county executive, all the mayors, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1142.32s)]
*  they immediately erased everything Netanyahu [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1146.0s)]
*  and all of the leaders in Israel were saying about Amalek [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1150.96s)]
*  and using white phosphorus and cutting off electricity. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1155.28s)]
*  Well, they ignored all that, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1157.96s)]
*  to stand with Israel. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1159.96s)]
*  And so, this is a national, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1161.0s)]
*  deeply entrenched problem over decades. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1163.2s)]
*  And it's gonna take us fighting for the rest [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1165.6s)]
*  of our lives to get on the other side of this. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1168.08s)]
*  And it's not going to happen because of someone's goodwill. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1172.28s)]
*  They're going to have to be forced through our organization. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1174.76s)]
*  So let's talk about your race. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1177.8799999999999s)]
*  You lost, I think, by 17 points. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1180.6s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1183.08s)]
*  Again, to George Latimer, who was your opponent, who took a [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1183.8799999999999s)]
*  very strongly pro-Israel stance. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1186.12s)]
*  Not just a strongly pro-Israel stance, suggested he and his [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1188.12s)]
*  allies suggested you were not just anti-Israel, but [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1190.36s)]
*  anti-Semitic. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1192.1999999999998s)]
*  I think you tell me, I've read numbers of $14, $15 million [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1193.8s)]
*  that went into your distance. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1196.6799999999998s)]
*  I've read more than that. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1197.4799999999998s)]
*  More than that, yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1198.56s)]
*  More than goes into other countries' entire elections. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1199.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well... [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1201.6s)]
*  Spent in one district in the Bronx. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1202.6s)]
*  Yeah, more spent than any other race in history in a district [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1203.84s)]
*  that covers the Northeast Bronx and southern Westchester County. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1208.84s)]
*  And how much do you believe that money played a role in [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1213.0s)]
*  defeating you? [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  A huge role, because they were able to bombard the district [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1216.4799999999998s)]
*  with ads, constant ads, digital cable and TV, bombard the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1220.32s)]
*  district with mailers. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1226.48s)]
*  I mean, the mailers were crazy. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1229.36s)]
*  I would come home, it would be 15 mailers in the box, 10 would be [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1230.36s)]
*  anti-mailers. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1232.76s)]
*  But they weren't really mentioning Israel either. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1233.52s)]
*  They were criticizing you from other... [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1234.52s)]
*  Correct. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1236.0s)]
*  They didn't mention Israel, but they said you were against [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1237.0s)]
*  Biden, you were against the infrastructure. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1238.76s)]
*  Correct, correct. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1240.56s)]
*  So this was the, you know, APEC, the MFI and UDPs. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1241.56s)]
*  Yes, the United Democracy Project, which is their PAC. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1245.56s)]
*  That's right, that's right. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1247.28s)]
*  So the money helps them to send the mailers and have the ads, but [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1248.08s)]
*  it also helps them to organize on the ground. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1254.12s)]
*  It also helps them to be more data-driven in how they make [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1256.12s)]
*  decisions in their race. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1259.12s)]
*  So the money is a big part. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1260.12s)]
*  Another big part that doesn't often get talked about, when we [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1262.12s)]
*  first beat... [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1266.12s)]
*  Now, remember, we beat Elliot Engel. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1267.12s)]
*  He was like the number one pro-Israel Zionist hawk in [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1269.12s)]
*  Washington. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1271.12s)]
*  When we first beat him, they had their eye out for us then. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1272.12s)]
*  And during the first redistricting process, they took [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1276.12s)]
*  180,000 black people out of the district. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1279.12s)]
*  And so a district that was majority black for 30 years, all [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1281.1599999999999s)]
*  of a sudden gets its first black rep and now it's no longer [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1285.1599999999999s)]
*  majority black. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1288.1599999999999s)]
*  And it no longer has the entire North Bronx, it has a small piece [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1289.1599999999999s)]
*  of it, right, and more in Westchester. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1294.1599999999999s)]
*  So it was a combination of the money, it was a combination of [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1296.1599999999999s)]
*  the redistricting, it was a candidate that people in [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1298.1599999999999s)]
*  Westchester especially knew and liked very much. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1300.1599999999999s)]
*  He was a popular local guy. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1303.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, popular local guy. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  What do you think you got wrong? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1305.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, last thing I want to say is, and it's a very [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1307.2s)]
*  pro-Israel district, right? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1310.2s)]
*  It's not like a district in the middle of nowhere with not that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1312.2s)]
*  many, you know, APEC people. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1315.2s)]
*  It was APEC Central for the most part. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1316.2s)]
*  What we could have done better is we could have been, and this is [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1318.2s)]
*  why I'm saying we have to do this work for the rest of our [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1322.2s)]
*  lives, you need to organize day to day in historically [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1325.2s)]
*  marginalized communities to engage people in the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1329.2s)]
*  political process. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1332.2s)]
*  So don't wait until you have a challenger in this election [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1333.2s)]
*  you have to be engaging people day to day. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1336.24s)]
*  And it's not just engaging them in getting more involved in the [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1338.24s)]
*  political process, it's engaging them in what's happening in your [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1341.24s)]
*  lives and how can I be more helpful? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1344.24s)]
*  How can I do more to help you get a good job, a better job, more [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1346.24s)]
*  money in your pocket? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1349.24s)]
*  How am I engaging you in dealing with issues of your child's [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1350.24s)]
*  education or health care? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1353.24s)]
*  It needs to be a holistic, data-driven, organizing approach [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1354.24s)]
*  that happens every day in order for us to build power. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1359.24s)]
*  And even that's not enough without us building the [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1362.24s)]
*  infrastructure that we need to beat the apex of the world or the [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1365.28s)]
*  fossil fuel lobby or whatever it is that we're fighting against. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1369.28s)]
*  It's very important to point out there are multiple lobbies at [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1372.28s)]
*  play here. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1374.28s)]
*  You're picking on the pro-Israel lobby. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1375.28s)]
*  It's the gun lobby, it's the oil lobby, they're all the same. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1377.28s)]
*  Yes, and they all want progressives out. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1380.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1382.28s)]
*  I mean, there was some lobby that came into the district that was [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1383.28s)]
*  an African-American lobby that was anti-Bowman and they were [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1386.28s)]
*  driving around the Bronx in a big truck with my face on it [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1389.28s)]
*  telling everybody how I'm this horrible guy. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1393.32s)]
*  The ad was something like, you know, I'm not fighting hard [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1395.32s)]
*  enough to keep guns off the street. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1399.32s)]
*  I'm like, what, are you kidding me? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1401.32s)]
*  That's one of my number one issues. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1403.32s)]
*  So there's an infrastructure in place to keep them in power. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1405.32s)]
*  I read somewhere that after October the 7th, a lot of the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1408.32s)]
*  local Jewish communities turned on you. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1411.32s)]
*  You were disinvited from synagogues. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1413.32s)]
*  Rabbis came out to endorse against you. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1415.32s)]
*  They accused you of anti-Semitism. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1417.32s)]
*  Number one, how does that make you feel? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1419.32s)]
*  What is your response to people who make this claim, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1421.36s)]
*  that people like yourself or Rashida Tlaib or other [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1423.36s)]
*  progressives are quite anti-Semitic? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1425.36s)]
*  Yes, it almost doesn't even warrant a response because it's [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1427.36s)]
*  so ridiculous. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1432.36s)]
*  When we fight for human rights, we fight for the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1434.36s)]
*  human rights of all people. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1436.36s)]
*  We're not fighting against one group of people because of their [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1438.36s)]
*  race or faith. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1442.36s)]
*  That is just completely ridiculous. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1444.36s)]
*  But, yeah, I mean, it wasn't surprising when the rabbis [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  organized a letter encouraging my opponents to run against me. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1451.3999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't surprising when I was disinvited to certain events [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1455.3999999999999s)]
*  because I had felt the vitriol, if you will, when I would go to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1459.3999999999999s)]
*  these events even when I was invited. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1464.3999999999999s)]
*  I would feel the... [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1467.3999999999999s)]
*  Because pre-October the 7th, you had already criticized [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1469.3999999999999s)]
*  Israel quite harshly after it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1471.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, when we first... [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1473.3999999999999s)]
*  I'll give you just one example. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1474.44s)]
*  When we first came in, I was a co-sponsor on Betty McCollum's [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1475.44s)]
*  bill just asking for an accounting of our money that [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1478.44s)]
*  goes to Israel so we can make sure that the money is not used [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1481.44s)]
*  to detain children in the West Bank. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1484.44s)]
*  I was a co-sponsor on that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1486.44s)]
*  A bill that wouldn't get a sniff in committee at all. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1487.44s)]
*  It would never make it to the floor for a vote. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1490.44s)]
*  But because I co-sponsored that, they bombarded my office, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1493.44s)]
*  they meaning the AIPAC lobby, bombarded my office with calls [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1496.44s)]
*  and letters. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1500.44s)]
*  We couldn't even do our jobs. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1501.44s)]
*  So, about a week, two weeks, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1502.44s)]
*  they protested outside the office with the Israel flag [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1503.48s)]
*  in an 80% black neighbourhood. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1506.48s)]
*  So, this is what they were doing, right? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1508.48s)]
*  They felt that I was a threat to their existence because of what [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1510.48s)]
*  Elian Ingle used to champion. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1515.48s)]
*  It's interesting because Youssef Maniah, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1517.48s)]
*  who's a Palestinian-American analyst here in DC, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1518.48s)]
*  he made the point that even though you and Cori Bush, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1520.48s)]
*  who was defeated after you in her primary, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1522.48s)]
*  with AIPAC money in that race as well, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1525.48s)]
*  he made the point that that's actually AIPAC looking weak, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1527.48s)]
*  not strong. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1531.48s)]
*  Because in the past, they didn't have to spend so much money [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1532.52s)]
*  to stop people. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1535.52s)]
*  It was much easier for them to get their way [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1536.52s)]
*  to silence their critics in Congress. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1538.52s)]
*  Actually, you and Cori Bush and others in the squad [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1540.52s)]
*  and other progressives like Jayapal Khan or whatever it is [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1542.52s)]
*  have actually moved the conversation in a way [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1546.52s)]
*  where they are petrified. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1548.52s)]
*  100%. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1549.52s)]
*  It's complete desperation on their part [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1550.52s)]
*  that they had to spend that much money. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1553.52s)]
*  It does show that they're weak. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1555.52s)]
*  They do not have the intellectual argument, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1557.52s)]
*  they do not have the moral argument, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1559.52s)]
*  they do not have the historical argument. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1560.52s)]
*  In fact, they don't mention Israel in their flyers. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1561.56s)]
*  Because they know, right? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1563.56s)]
*  But to have... [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1565.56s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1566.56s)]
*  You have members, myself included, on the House floor [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1567.56s)]
*  arguing in defense of Rashida Tlaib's right [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1571.56s)]
*  to say from the river to the sea on the House floor. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1574.56s)]
*  A couple of years ago, you had the squad stand up [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1578.56s)]
*  and argue against the apartheid in Israel. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1581.56s)]
*  You don't have no one else in Congress doing things like this, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1585.56s)]
*  and so... [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1588.6s)]
*  Because we're fighting for justice. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1589.6s)]
*  And justice for Palestinians means justice for Israelis too. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1591.6s)]
*  It means self-determination and safety for everyone. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1595.6s)]
*  We continue to lie to ourselves about what's happening there [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1599.6s)]
*  and what we get. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1603.6s)]
*  We get in October 7th and we get a genocide. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1604.6s)]
*  I've got to ask you a question. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1606.6s)]
*  You're leaving Congress now. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1607.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1608.6s)]
*  So maybe you're freer to speak about this stuff, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1609.6s)]
*  but what is it like in the House? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1611.6s)]
*  Seriously, because people... [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1613.6s)]
*  There are a lot of decent Democrats I speak to. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1614.6s)]
*  House Democrats. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1617.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1618.6399999999999s)]
*  You've heard the phrase PEP, Progressive Except Palestine. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1619.6399999999999s)]
*  They will be passionate on every issue. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1622.6399999999999s)]
*  Child tax credit, child care, humanitarian aid abroad, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1624.6399999999999s)]
*  supporting refugees, justice for Ukrainians under fire. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  Palestine, not a word. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1632.6399999999999s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1634.6399999999999s)]
*  Do they know and they just turn a blind eye? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1635.6399999999999s)]
*  Do they stay willfully ignorant? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1638.6399999999999s)]
*  Is it, quote-unquote, the APAC buddy [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  that Thomas Massey recently talked about, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  the Republican, in an interview? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1646.68s)]
*  I think it's all of the above, man. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1647.68s)]
*  I think it's... [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1649.68s)]
*  Many of them are probably strong supporters of Israel [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1650.68s)]
*  and have no knowledge of Palestine or the history there. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1652.68s)]
*  The dehumanisation, the invisibility. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1655.68s)]
*  Yeah, they have no knowledge, right? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1657.68s)]
*  It's like when you learn about European history [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1659.68s)]
*  in schools and no other history. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1661.68s)]
*  So you... Right? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1663.68s)]
*  So I think there's that. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1664.68s)]
*  I think it's also like, man, I don't want to deal with APAC. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1666.68s)]
*  Like, I don't want to have to deal with my phones being bombarded [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1669.68s)]
*  and protests outside my office. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1672.68s)]
*  I want to deal with that. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1674.68s)]
*  And lastly, I don't want to lose my seat, right? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1675.72s)]
*  And I don't want to have tens of millions of dollars [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1677.72s)]
*  spent against me in ads about... [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1679.72s)]
*  in articles about my... [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1681.72s)]
*  I mean, they wrote about my children. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1682.72s)]
*  They wrote about my children's school. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1684.72s)]
*  I had reporters showing up at my home. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1686.72s)]
*  They don't want to deal with that. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1688.72s)]
*  And this is, when we say, like, special interests in general, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1690.72s)]
*  but certain special interests in particular [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1693.72s)]
*  have way too much power in Congress, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1695.72s)]
*  this is the example of it. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1697.72s)]
*  And for me, it's incredibly frustrating. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1699.72s)]
*  I'm a middle school principal, right? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1701.72s)]
*  In my job, you come to work every day [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1703.76s)]
*  to help child A learn how to read [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1706.76s)]
*  or learn how to do math or support families. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1709.76s)]
*  So it's really outcomes-driven, right? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1711.76s)]
*  You help people get from point A to point B. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1713.76s)]
*  In Congress, man, trying to move something through that place, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1716.76s)]
*  if it's not focused on police or Israel big business, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1719.76s)]
*  it doesn't move. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1721.76s)]
*  So why have we been fighting for 20 years [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1723.76s)]
*  to lift children out of poverty? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1725.76s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1727.76s)]
*  We couldn't raise the federal minimum wage [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1728.76s)]
*  when I first got to Congress, again, because of Joe Manchin. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1730.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1732.8s)]
*  And so, it's... [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1734.8s)]
*  How does it feel? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1736.8s)]
*  Incredibly frustrating to be in a place with so much power [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1737.8s)]
*  but it's so controlled by special interests. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1740.8s)]
*  It's interesting about the movement on Israel as an issue. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1743.8s)]
*  There was an event a few years back, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1745.8s)]
*  I'm trying to paraphrase, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1747.8s)]
*  Pelosi and Schumer were at an event in Antibolich. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1748.8s)]
*  And they actually made a joke about if Congress burned to the ground, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1750.8s)]
*  the one thing all the party would still agree on [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1753.8s)]
*  is we need to support Israel, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1755.8s)]
*  which is a bizarre thing for American politicians to say. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1757.8s)]
*  One last question for you, well, a couple of last questions for you. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1759.8s)]
*  You said in her kind of farewell address [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1761.84s)]
*  when she lost on the night, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1763.84s)]
*  the AIPAC, I'm coming for you, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1764.84s)]
*  she's going to carry on the work of fighting. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1765.84s)]
*  Are you part of that fight? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1767.84s)]
*  Is that AIPAC? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1768.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1769.84s)]
*  You still want to fight with them [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1770.84s)]
*  and try and reduce their conditions? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1772.84s)]
*  I still want to fight for justice, right? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1774.84s)]
*  So, fighting for justice takes a variety of forms. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1776.84s)]
*  It's electoral politics, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1778.84s)]
*  but there are other ways to fight for justice, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1780.84s)]
*  so I plan to still do that. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1782.84s)]
*  I'm still going to fight for police reform, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1783.84s)]
*  criminal justice reform, all those other things. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1785.84s)]
*  It's interesting that a lot of Republican donors [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1787.84s)]
*  tell you about it. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1789.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not a bipartisan group. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1790.8799999999999s)]
*  Maybe it was at one time. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1791.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, there were people on camera [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1792.8799999999999s)]
*  confidently saying, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  I support George Latimer and Donald Trump. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1796.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1798.8799999999999s)]
*  It's... [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1799.8799999999999s)]
*  So, last question, then. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1800.8799999999999s)]
*  What do you plan to do next? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1801.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. We'll see, man. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1802.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm still figuring it out. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  Right now, listen, man, I have, you know, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1806.8799999999999s)]
*  a beautiful wife, she's a third-grade teacher, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1808.8799999999999s)]
*  she's a single mom when I'm here doing this. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1811.8799999999999s)]
*  So, the more I could be in New York supporting her, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1813.8799999999999s)]
*  the better. Shout out to Melissa. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1815.8799999999999s)]
*  I got a son just starting high school [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1817.92s)]
*  and a daughter in fifth grade. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1819.92s)]
*  Like, let me spend some time with my family. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1821.92s)]
*  It's close to home, right? Please do. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1823.92s)]
*  Then we'll see in a couple years, right? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1825.92s)]
*  We'll see what the political arena looks like. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1827.92s)]
*  But it's... [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1830.92s)]
*  How can we continue to make it happen? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1832.92s)]
*  You're not ruling out return to Congress? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1834.92s)]
*  Not the House. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1836.92s)]
*  I don't think I'll return to the House. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1837.92s)]
*  OK. Maybe the Senate. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1839.92s)]
*  Maybe U.S. Senate. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1841.92s)]
*  Maybe running for governor or running for mayor [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1842.92s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1844.92s)]
*  But there has to be a role with much more influence [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1846.96s)]
*  because we got... [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1850.96s)]
*  We got children dying every day of gun violence. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1852.96s)]
*  Like, I can't sit on that. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1854.96s)]
*  And we got a genocide going on. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1856.96s)]
*  Another policy where a special interest [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1858.96s)]
*  has prevented any movement, the NRA. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1860.96s)]
*  Correct. Which we recognise, by the way. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1862.96s)]
*  We recognise that the gun lobby plays a huge role, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1864.96s)]
*  but we won't recognise the Israel lobby does the same. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1866.96s)]
*  And the last thing, think about how lost we are as a country. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1868.96s)]
*  You have a genocide happening in Gaza [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1871.96s)]
*  and you have the person committing the genocide [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1874.0s)]
*  during the genocide to come address a joint depression... [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1876.0s)]
*  The Democrats stayed in the hall to applaud him. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1879.0s)]
*  Many left, but many stayed. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1881.0s)]
*  Yes. That's where we are. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1883.0s)]
*  That is where we are. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1885.0s)]
*  Congressman Bowman, thank you so much for your time. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1886.0s)]
*  Appreciate it. Good to see you. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1888.0s)]
*  The ongoing genocidal war in occupied Gaza [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1890.0s)]
*  is putting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1892.0s)]
*  under a lot of pressure. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1895.0s)]
*  Not from the United States [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1897.0s)]
*  and not from his country's die-hard allies [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1899.0s)]
*  elsewhere in the world, but his own citizens. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1901.0s)]
*  The Israeli army in Tel Aviv was brought to a standstill [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1903.04s)]
*  over the weekend as more than 750,000 protesters [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1905.04s)]
*  took to the streets around the country, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1908.04s)]
*  not just in Tel Aviv, calling for a deal [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1910.04s)]
*  that would release the hostages in Gaza [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1912.04s)]
*  exactly 11 months on from the war. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1914.04s)]
*  These protests, possibly the largest in Israel's history, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1916.04s)]
*  came after the Israeli army announced last week [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1919.04s)]
*  that it recovered the bodies of six hostages [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1922.04s)]
*  in occupied Gaza that were previously being held by Hamas. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1924.04s)]
*  Now, it's important to note [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1927.04s)]
*  that these aren't necessarily anti-war protests. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1929.04s)]
*  And not everyone you see on the streets of Tel Aviv... [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1931.08s)]
*  Well, not all of them are calling for an end to the genocide [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1933.08s)]
*  or even an end to the occupation. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1935.08s)]
*  On the contrary, actually, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1937.08s)]
*  this billboard was spotted in several locations in Tel Aviv [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1939.08s)]
*  saying, bring back the Israeli hostages, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1942.08s)]
*  then go back into Gaza. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1944.08s)]
*  The protesters clearly hate Netanyahu, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1946.08s)]
*  but they hate him for jeopardising the lives [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1948.08s)]
*  of Israeli hostages, not necessarily [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1951.08s)]
*  the lives of Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1953.08s)]
*  To find out more about the mood on the streets [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1955.08s)]
*  during the protest, I'm joined by Haifa-based lawyer, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1957.08s)]
*  analyst and Ziteo contributor, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1959.12s)]
*  Deanna Butu, a Palestinian citizen of Israel [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1961.12s)]
*  who was on the ground as protesters marched. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1964.12s)]
*  Deanna, thank you for joining me on Mayor the Unfiltered. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1966.12s)]
*  Let's start with what you saw and heard [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1969.12s)]
*  while you were at these protests. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1971.12s)]
*  Obviously, these aren't the first large protests [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1973.12s)]
*  that have taken place demanding a hostage release. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1975.12s)]
*  What was different about these ones this weekend [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1977.12s)]
*  that got a lot of notice? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1979.12s)]
*  Thank you, Mati. Thanks for having me. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1981.12s)]
*  I went to two protests, one in Haifa, the city in which I live, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1983.12s)]
*  and another one just outside of the city of Nazareth [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1986.1599999999999s)]
*  called Nahaland. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1989.1599999999999s)]
*  And what's interesting about these protests is the size. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1991.1599999999999s)]
*  But what's also interesting is the fact [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1994.1599999999999s)]
*  that Palestinians are completely absent from these protests, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=1996.1599999999999s)]
*  meaning that none of the signs, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2000.1599999999999s)]
*  none of the slogans, none of the speeches [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2002.1599999999999s)]
*  are ever talking about what Israel has done to Palestinians. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2004.1599999999999s)]
*  In fact, we are simply invisible. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2009.1599999999999s)]
*  They're talking about the losses that they have sustained, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2011.1599999999999s)]
*  but there is not at all a reckoning with the genocide. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2014.2s)]
*  In fact, you don't see the term genocide. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2017.2s)]
*  You don't see slogans to end even the war. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2019.2s)]
*  It's simply a question of focusing on the hostages [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2022.2s)]
*  and retrieving the hostages, but not at all on Palestinians. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2026.2s)]
*  Palestinians are invisible, but you went along. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2030.2s)]
*  You were visible. How were you greeted? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2032.2s)]
*  Did anyone notice you? Did you get in any discussions? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2034.2s)]
*  Were you welcome? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2036.2s)]
*  I was there. People did not notice me. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2038.2s)]
*  But what was very interesting is that there was one man [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2040.24s)]
*  who was carrying what I think he thought was a Palestinian flag. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2043.24s)]
*  It's actually a Sudanese flag. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2046.24s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2048.2400000000002s)]
*  Apart from that, people didn't know me. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2050.2400000000002s)]
*  They couldn't tell who I was. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2053.2400000000002s)]
*  And the conversations that I did get into, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2055.2400000000002s)]
*  and I did get into a few of them, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2058.2400000000002s)]
*  were very much just focused on Israel. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2059.2400000000002s)]
*  It was people are angry about the economy. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2062.2400000000002s)]
*  They're angry about the fact that they're not getting [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2065.2400000000002s)]
*  into the army. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2068.2799999999997s)]
*  They're angry about the fact that this is continuing. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2070.2799999999997s)]
*  They're angry with Netanyahu. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2073.2799999999997s)]
*  They're angry with the fact that the Khadidims are not going [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2075.2799999999997s)]
*  to the army, but not at all any sort of reckoning [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2078.2799999999997s)]
*  with what they've done to Palestinians. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  In fact, I asked them about it, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2083.2799999999997s)]
*  and the answer was very typical, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2085.2799999999997s)]
*  which is, you know, there's nothing we can do. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2087.2799999999997s)]
*  So is it your contention that if there was a hostage deal [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2090.2799999999997s)]
*  and the hostages came out, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2094.2799999999997s)]
*  they would just go home? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2096.32s)]
*  Yes. And in fact, they would just go home [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2098.32s)]
*  and then bomb Gaza the very next day. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2101.32s)]
*  This is the problem, Mahdi, is that the way [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2104.32s)]
*  that Israel was created was through the dehumanization [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2107.32s)]
*  and through creating Palestinians as being invisible. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2110.32s)]
*  And even now, the way that they're treating Palestinians [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2113.32s)]
*  is through dehumanizing them, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2117.32s)]
*  and of course, by making sure that we are invisible. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2119.32s)]
*  So you don't see a reckoning of saying, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2122.32s)]
*  you know, when committing genocide, this must end. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2125.36s)]
*  Instead, it's simply about what has happened to them. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2128.36s)]
*  So, you're 100% right. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2131.36s)]
*  Let's just talk about the politics of the protests, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2133.36s)]
*  because a lot of this is a continuation of the protests [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2136.36s)]
*  that took place in 2023, pre-October 7, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2139.36s)]
*  over the judicial, quote-unquote, reforms [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2142.36s)]
*  that Netanyahu was pushing, the coup, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2144.36s)]
*  to make himself kind of less accountable to the judiciary. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2146.36s)]
*  A lot of those protesters are back now, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2149.36s)]
*  calling for a hostage deal. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2152.36s)]
*  There's a thread between those protests, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2154.4s)]
*  and these are hatred for Netanyahu. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2156.4s)]
*  Clearly, he's a loathed politician by many in Israel. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2158.4s)]
*  Do you see a kind of dissonance, a disconnect, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2161.4s)]
*  between how Netanyahu's covered in Israel, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2164.4s)]
*  how he's protested against in Israel, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2167.4s)]
*  how the hostages' families hate him in Israel, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2169.4s)]
*  and how in the United States, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2171.4s)]
*  he's still embraced by the ruling class, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2173.4s)]
*  he's still embraced by the media, softball interviews, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2176.4s)]
*  and in fact, no-one really challenges him [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2179.4s)]
*  on the fact that the hostages he claims to be fighting for, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2181.4s)]
*  is against him? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2183.44s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. There is such a disconnect. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2185.44s)]
*  Look, inside Israel, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2187.44s)]
*  the vast majority of Israelis do not support him, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2189.44s)]
*  and we see this not just in the numbers of people [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2192.44s)]
*  who are coming out weekly to these protests, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2194.44s)]
*  but in the ways in which they speak about him. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2197.44s)]
*  And so he's a very unpopular prime minister. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2200.44s)]
*  He was unpopular before October, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2203.44s)]
*  and he remains deeply unpopular. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2205.44s)]
*  And at the same time, I think there now is a reckoning [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2207.44s)]
*  that the reason that Netanyahu remains [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2211.48s)]
*  and the reason that they're continuing this genocide [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2214.48s)]
*  is because they know that once Israel stops, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2217.48s)]
*  that there will be attempts to go after him, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2220.48s)]
*  not for genocide, but for all of the corruption. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2223.48s)]
*  So, yes, he's deeply unpopular, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2226.48s)]
*  and yet you don't see that coming across [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2229.48s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2231.48s)]
*  It's quite the opposite where he gets standing ovations [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2233.48s)]
*  inside Congress and rounds of applause. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2236.48s)]
*  So many that I stopped counting. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2240.52s)]
*  Yeah, he gets a free hand, and as a result, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2242.52s)]
*  we have the killing in Gaza continue [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2244.52s)]
*  as we approach the one-year anniversary [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2246.52s)]
*  of what happened on October 7th, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2248.52s)]
*  of those attacks on October 7th. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2250.52s)]
*  I don't think any of us imagined it would still be going on [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2252.52s)]
*  like this a year later. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2254.52s)]
*  We have the attacks in Mawasi this week, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2255.52s)]
*  the so-called safe zone. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2257.52s)]
*  At least 19 Palestinians killed, another 60 injured. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2259.52s)]
*  And not just the free hand in Gaza, of course, Dianna, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2262.52s)]
*  but as some of us predicted, this would spread. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2264.52s)]
*  And we now have this escalating violence [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2267.52s)]
*  in the occupied West Bank. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2269.56s)]
*  Raids, detentions, the killing of an American protester [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2271.56s)]
*  last week in the West Bank. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2274.56s)]
*  Is that because Netanyahu thinks, A, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2279.56s)]
*  this is a time to get away with it? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2281.56s)]
*  Is this Ben Gavir in his government and Smotrich [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2283.56s)]
*  thinking this is a moment to expand the settlements, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2285.56s)]
*  Fed accompli, facts on the ground? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2288.56s)]
*  What's driving, do you think, what's happening in the West Bank? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2290.56s)]
*  That's a great question, Mahdi. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2293.56s)]
*  You know, in Israel, there's long been a debate [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2295.56s)]
*  about who calls the shots. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2297.6s)]
*  Is it the United States or is it Israel? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2299.6s)]
*  And what Netanyahu and Ben Gavir are all about [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2301.6s)]
*  is showing the United States that they're the ones [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2304.6s)]
*  who are calling the shots. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2306.6s)]
*  So they're going to continue because this government, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2308.6s)]
*  the Biden administration, has given them a free hand. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2311.6s)]
*  And they're hoping that Trump will be elected [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2314.6s)]
*  so that they can do whatever it is that they want to do. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2317.6s)]
*  So when you see that you've got a government [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2321.6s)]
*  that has made it clear that they want to get rid of Palestinians [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2324.64s)]
*  and that, in fact, they are doing their best [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2327.64s)]
*  to get rid of Palestinians in Gaza [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2330.64s)]
*  but also in the West Bank, and nobody stopping them, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2332.64s)]
*  then, of course, they're going to try to drag it out [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2336.64s)]
*  as far as possible until they get the president of their choice [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2338.64s)]
*  who has already said that Netanyahu should, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2342.64s)]
*  quote-unquote, finish the job. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2345.64s)]
*  So I want to come back to Trump in one moment, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2347.64s)]
*  just on Biden, before we move on to Trump. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2349.64s)]
*  I'm not sure if he's a little statement he put out [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2351.64s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2353.68s)]
*  The written statement was pretty bad. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2355.68s)]
*  The verbal statement was even worse when he said to reporters, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2357.68s)]
*  oh, I think, apparently, it was a ricochet. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2360.68s)]
*  It hit the ground and accidentally killed [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2362.68s)]
*  an American citizen in the West Bank. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2364.68s)]
*  That's the president of the United States [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2366.68s)]
*  uncritically accepting the Israeli line. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2368.68s)]
*  In fact, going beyond the Israeli line, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2370.68s)]
*  even the Israelis didn't say it was a ricochet. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2372.68s)]
*  They said a sniper shot her thinking she was a threat, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2374.68s)]
*  but she wasn't. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2376.68s)]
*  It was an accident in that way. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2377.68s)]
*  He seems to have gone even beyond Israel. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2379.68s)]
*  He's a man who was famous for his empathy [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2381.72s)]
*  but simply cannot ever empathise with one group of people [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2383.72s)]
*  and obviously not just one group of people [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2387.72s)]
*  because this was a Turkish-American citizen, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2389.72s)]
*  not a Palestinian, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2391.72s)]
*  but cannot empathise with anyone killed by Israel, clearly. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2393.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2396.72s)]
*  And we've seen this time and again, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2398.72s)]
*  you know, when my friend, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2400.72s)]
*  former journalist Shirin Abouakle was killed, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2402.72s)]
*  we saw the same accepting of Israeli lines [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2405.72s)]
*  day after day after day [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  and lack of empathy towards any Palestinian life. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2412.7599999999998s)]
*  And here's the problem, Mahdi. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2416.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not just that he's providing cover [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2418.7599999999998s)]
*  and saying that there was this ricochet or whatever it was, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2421.7599999999998s)]
*  but that nobody's questioning [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2424.7599999999998s)]
*  why isn't it that Israel's allowed [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2426.7599999999998s)]
*  to use live weaponry, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2428.7599999999998s)]
*  live ammunition on Palestinians [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2430.7599999999998s)]
*  who are simply trying to access their land. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2433.7599999999998s)]
*  This is the fundamental question [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2435.7599999999998s)]
*  and yet he never answers that. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2437.7599999999998s)]
*  He just gives Israel a pass. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2439.8s)]
*  Even their excuse to Israeli militaries [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2441.8s)]
*  that these people were throwing stones, allegedly. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2443.8s)]
*  He was 200 metres away, this sniper. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2445.8s)]
*  There's no scenario in which a stone was a threat to him. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2447.8s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2449.8s)]
*  Did you watch any of the presidential debate? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2451.8s)]
*  Did you see the exchange on Gaza, which came very late? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2453.8s)]
*  I said on Gaza. It wasn't really about Gaza [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2455.8s)]
*  because they made it into a competition [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2457.8s)]
*  between Harris and Trump as to who loves Israel more. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2459.8s)]
*  That's exactly the problem. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2462.8s)]
*  In addition to repeating all of these now-debunked claims, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2464.8s)]
*  it was a question of who loves Israel more [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2468.84s)]
*  and it's become clear that the vast majority of Americans [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2471.84s)]
*  want to see a ceasefire. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2474.84s)]
*  This is what polling is telling us [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2476.84s)]
*  and yet we have these two candidates [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2478.84s)]
*  who are falling over themselves [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2480.84s)]
*  to prove that they have better Israel credentials. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2482.84s)]
*  You know, this is the tragedy [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2485.84s)]
*  is that we cannot, as Palestinians, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2487.84s)]
*  look to the United States to be providing a free hand, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2489.84s)]
*  to be providing any level of honest brokering or otherwise. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2493.84s)]
*  They're simply not honest or fair. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2497.88s)]
*  They're not honest or fair. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2499.88s)]
*  Neither party are when it comes to the occupied territories. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2501.88s)]
*  But let me ask you a difficult, contentious question [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2504.88s)]
*  right now here in the US. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2506.88s)]
*  Amongst Arab-American, Muslim-American communities [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2508.88s)]
*  who are going to vote, you mentioned a moment ago [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2510.88s)]
*  that Ben Gavir and Smotrich are waiting for Trump [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2512.88s)]
*  and I think that's undeniable. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2514.88s)]
*  I think Ben Gavir has said, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2516.88s)]
*  is Trump will give us the free hand that Biden doesn't. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2518.88s)]
*  Other ministers, the Minister for Diaspora Affairs has said, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2520.88s)]
*  I want Trump, not Biden. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2523.88s)]
*  I think that's a very clear question, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2525.92s)]
*  and I think that's a very clear question [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2527.92s)]
*  for Natanyahu, who clearly wants Trump. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2529.92s)]
*  Question, then. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2532.92s)]
*  Is it fair to say, then, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2534.92s)]
*  that if Donald Trump were elected president, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2536.92s)]
*  he would be even worse on Gaza [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2538.92s)]
*  than Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who have been awful? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2540.92s)]
*  I think that all of them are going to be awful on Gaza. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2544.92s)]
*  I think that we do a disservice [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2547.92s)]
*  if we somehow say that Trump is going to be better [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2549.92s)]
*  than Joe Biden. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2554.96s)]
*  I think that's a clear record that Trump had. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2556.96s)]
*  He's the man who set into place [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2558.96s)]
*  and made it easy and possible [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2560.96s)]
*  for Israel to go after UNRWA. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2562.96s)]
*  And we see that what the Biden administration did [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2564.96s)]
*  was simply pick up on all of those policies. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2567.96s)]
*  I've yet to hear President Biden calling for, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2570.96s)]
*  pushing for a ceasefire, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2574.96s)]
*  and he has it within his capability to do so. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2576.96s)]
*  And similarly, Kamala Harris has not been forceful. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2579.96s)]
*  As Palestinians, we know that, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2584.0s)]
*  whether it's Republican or a Democrat, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2586.0s)]
*  that the policies are going to continue, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2588.0s)]
*  and this is why it's so disheartening for people. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2590.0s)]
*  It is disheartening, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2593.0s)]
*  and it's frustrating to see Democrats say stuff like that. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2595.0s)]
*  But we're working on a ceasefire [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2597.0s)]
*  as if they're powerless bystanders, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2599.0s)]
*  not the people who are arming the genocidal army. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2601.0s)]
*  Diana Boudour, we will have to leave it there. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2604.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, as ever, for your analysis [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2606.0s)]
*  and for all your pieces for Zatea. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2608.0s)]
*  We appreciate you as a columnist. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2610.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2612.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DhlYi8gFpg&t=2642.0s)]
