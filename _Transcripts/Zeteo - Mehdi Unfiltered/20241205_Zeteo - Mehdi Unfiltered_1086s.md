Video Description: Mehdi Hasan sits down with candidate Zohran Mamdani to discuss why New York City could elect a Socialist as its next mayor.

“When I went out and spoke to New Yorkers directly, what I found is their major concerns were actually concerns at the heart of a left economic program. They wanted a more affordable life. They wanted to be able to afford their rent, their groceries, their electricity bills," Mamdani tells Mehdi.

He adds, "And what they found in the presidential election was that one candidate, as insincere and ridiculous as we know him to be, was offering a promise for that very cheaper life, offering a return to four years ago, when they remembered having more money in their pocket.”                                        

Watch the full interview to hear about Mamdani's promises to make the city more affordable, to honor international law when it comes to arresting Netanyahu, and to give New Yorkers the consistency he thinks they want.

# 'He's not going to resign. He's going to reign': This Socialist Wants to Oust NYC's Mayor Eric Adams
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [December 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA)
*  I'm here in New York City, which has had a pretty interesting year, a tough year some may argue, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=0.0s)]
*  from fascists renting arenas for hate-filled rallies to billionaires targeting college students on campus for protesting and genocide [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=6.0s)]
*  to a police force that treats those students like criminals. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=13.0s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that this isn't the city that Frank Sinatra once sang about. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=16.0s)]
*  So as the Big Apple's DNA twists and shifts, we just had a presidential election in which the Democratic Party's margin of victory [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=21.0s)]
*  in this city over the Republicans shrunk by 16 percentage points since 2020. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=28.0s)]
*  To find out why, New York State Assemblymember from Queens, Zoran Mamdani, took to the streets. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=34.0s)]
*  Hillside Avenue in Queens and Fordham Road in the Bronx are two areas that saw the biggest shift towards Trump in last week's election. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=40.0s)]
*  Even more residents didn't vote at all. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=47.0s)]
*  They like Trump because they don't want the Palestinians, the brothers, the killed, the war in Ukraine, the Democrats giving all the money and the war. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=49.0s)]
*  This is no good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=57.0s)]
*  The swing is because people want lower prices. They probably believe that Trump would give them that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=58.0s)]
*  Market, energy, gas, la comida. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=62.0s)]
*  And Zoran Mamdani, Democrat and Democratic Socialist, is running for Mayor of New York. He joins me now. Thank you for coming on May the Unfiltered. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=66.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=74.0s)]
*  So why are you running for mayor and why now at the age of 34, I believe? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=75.0s)]
*  I'm running for mayor to make this city more affordable for working class New Yorkers. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=81.0s)]
*  What we've had under the Adams administration and frankly under many previous mayors is a politics that has pushed the working class from the mainstream to the margins. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=86.0s)]
*  This is a position that sets the rent for two and a half million New Yorkers. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=94.0s)]
*  This is a position that can either make it cheaper or more expensive to use water in New York City, to use your gas, your electricity. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=98.0s)]
*  And yet what we've seen is we've had a mayor who's used almost every opportunity to exacerbate the cost of living crisis. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=105.0s)]
*  It's time we do the opposite. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=111.0s)]
*  We will come to Eric Adams in a moment. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=112.0s)]
*  Let's just talk about the election we just had, the presidential election in New York City. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=115.0s)]
*  I believe Donald Trump had the best performance in share of the vote for Republican in New York since 1988. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=119.0s)]
*  He picked up votes, I think, in every borough of the city. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=126.0s)]
*  Why then do you think Democrats in New York are going to look for a lefty progressive socialist candidate like yourself? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=129.0s)]
*  Won't they just say we need a more right-wing candidate because New York's more right-wing? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=138.0s)]
*  Well, I think it depends on whether you actually listen to the voters or not. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=142.0s)]
*  Many politicians across New York City and New York State are just using this as an opportunity to air their previously held opinions about whether or not the left should be part of a governing coalition. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=145.0s)]
*  But when I went out and spoke to New Yorkers directly, what I found is their major concerns were actually concerns at the heart of a left economic program. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=154.0s)]
*  They wanted a more affordable life. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=162.0s)]
*  They wanted to be able to afford their rent, their groceries, their electricity bills. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=164.0s)]
*  And what they found in the presidential election was that one candidate, as insincere and ridiculous as we know him to be, was offering a promise for that very cheaper life, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=169.0s)]
*  was offering a return to four years ago when they remembered having more money in their pocket. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=178.0s)]
*  Yes, don't get me started on the amnesia in this country. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=183.0s)]
*  We're about to have a convicted criminal in the Oval Office. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=187.0s)]
*  And here in New York, you have the current mayor, Eric Adams, a Democrat, who became this year the first sitting mayor of New York City to face criminal charges in modern history. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=190.0s)]
*  He's accused of accepting bribes, soliciting illegal foreign donations. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=198.0s)]
*  During his last 2021 election campaign, he's denied the allegations. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=202.0s)]
*  He says he's not going to step down. He's going to run again, although we know the governor, Kathy Hoke, also a Democrat, has the power, should she choose to suspend him. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=206.0s)]
*  Do you think he's going to get suspended? Do you think, A, Governor Hoke is going to step up and suspend him? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=214.0s)]
*  And B, do you think he will end up running again? Do you think you'll be running against him for the Democratic primary nomination? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=218.0s)]
*  I don't think he's going to get suspended, and I do think he's going to run again. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=224.0s)]
*  If there's one of the few things, the ever-growing list of things in common between Eric Adams and Donald Trump, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=227.0s)]
*  is a sense of impunity and a belief that accountability does not apply to them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=232.0s)]
*  And what we've seen with Eric Adams is a continued insistence that he is not going to step down. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=237.0s)]
*  In his own words, he's going to step up. He's not going to resign. He's going to reign. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=243.0s)]
*  And those are the words of someone who doesn't believe an election could be that very check, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=246.0s)]
*  while I do believe this will be the chance for voters to step up and make clear what they want to see in the city. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=251.0s)]
*  You compared him to Donald Trump in an interview with The View. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=256.0s)]
*  Mayor Adams recently dodged a question on whether he's cozying up to Donald Trump in an effort to secure a pardon from the president-elect. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=260.0s)]
*  Do you think he's trying to get a pardon out of a Trump White House? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=267.0s)]
*  I think he understands that his future is tied up with the sentiments of Donald Trump towards him. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=270.0s)]
*  And it's been very clear it's not only that dodge, it's also when he was asked whether he had anything to say [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=275.0s)]
*  about President Trump's promise to create the largest ever deportation force in American history. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=281.0s)]
*  Mayor Adams refused to denounce it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=286.0s)]
*  This is a program that, if enacted, would tear thousands of New Yorkers from their homes, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=288.0s)]
*  would rip the fabric of our city. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=293.0s)]
*  And we have a mayor instead who's focused on praising Elon Musk [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=295.0s)]
*  and the technical capabilities that he would bring to a White House administration. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=298.0s)]
*  I want to come back to the migrant issue in just a moment. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=302.0s)]
*  Just sticking with Adams, what does it say about the Democratic Party in New York, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=305.0s)]
*  Democratic voters in New York, Democratic base in New York? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=310.0s)]
*  He was your guy in 21. He won that fair and square. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=313.0s)]
*  I'm one of these people who snarkily tweets all the time every time there's an Adams controversy. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=318.0s)]
*  I tweet they could have had Maya Wiley. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=323.0s)]
*  There were other options. There were good options. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=325.0s)]
*  And yet New York, first New York Democrats and then New York City chose Eric Adams. Why? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=328.0s)]
*  Well, I think first it's important to remember just how close that victory was. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=333.0s)]
*  He won by 7,000 votes in a city of 8.3 million people. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=337.0s)]
*  He might walk around like it was in the primary. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=341.0s)]
*  He might walk around like it was a landslide, but that is the truth. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=343.0s)]
*  And I think that one of the reasons that he won is that he spoke directly to working class New Yorkers, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=346.0s)]
*  the multiracial working class across the city, but he spoke to them with a message that was insincere. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=352.0s)]
*  He promised them all of the very things he has betrayed, whether it is putting 1% of the city budget towards parks. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=357.0s)]
*  He has then done cuts that have exacerbated these brushfires we've seen across New York City of all places. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=363.0s)]
*  And he's done that time and again, making their lives more expensive and unaffordable while having promised them the opposite. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=369.0s)]
*  Just on expensive and affordable, you mentioned at the start you're running to try and reduce the cost of living [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=375.0s)]
*  for working Americans, working New Yorkers. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=382.0s)]
*  You are running on a very ambitious campaign pledge, set of pledges, freezing the rent for stabilized tenants, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=384.0s)]
*  making buses free, making childcare free for up to five years of age. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=391.0s)]
*  Very populist policies, I would argue popular policies, much needed policies, but you know what the critique will be. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=396.0s)]
*  How are you going to pay for them? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=404.0s)]
*  We are already paying for the absence of them. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=405.0s)]
*  What I mean by that is that we've seen a loss of about $20 billion in economic output because of the cost of childcare in New York City, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=408.0s)]
*  where families are leaving our city to find a place where their dollar can go a little further, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=416.0s)]
*  because here in the five boroughs it can cost up to $25,000 a year to have childcare for your child. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=421.0s)]
*  And the way that we would pay for universal childcare, the way that we would pay for free buses, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=427.0s)]
*  we would do so by increasing a state corporate tax rate to the levels that are already seen in places like New Jersey. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=433.0s)]
*  This is not pie in the sky thinking. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=439.0s)]
*  It's just actually catching up to our neighbors and ensuring that we take care of working class New Yorkers, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=441.0s)]
*  who what we've seen is that when we invest in them, we actually can even make more money in return. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=446.0s)]
*  But you're not running on a specific platform of raising taxes on Wall Street. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=450.0s)]
*  Well, I've said very clearly that we will raise taxes on the top corporate earners in New York State. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=454.0s)]
*  And the beauty of New York State tax law is that your company need not be located in the state. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=460.0s)]
*  It just has to do business in the state to be taxed on your earnings. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=465.0s)]
*  You mentioned a moment ago that people are leaving New York City. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=468.0s)]
*  What about the people arriving? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=471.0s)]
*  A lot of red state governors have done this pretty cruel, cynical gimmick of sending migrants in buses to, quote unquote, blue cities. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=473.0s)]
*  New York has been one of them. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=480.0s)]
*  Mayor Adams has made a lot of noise about the challenges of dealing with migrants coming in to New York City. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=481.0s)]
*  New Yorkers, if you believe the polls, are becoming more and more hostile towards migrants. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=488.0s)]
*  How would a Mayor Mamdani deal with this? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=493.0s)]
*  First, I would end this chapter of demagoguery and demonization that Mayor Adams has engaged in with regards to asylum seekers. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=495.0s)]
*  He has said that they will destroy New York City. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=503.0s)]
*  And he has built on top of that by awarding more than $400 million in single no-bid contracts to companies that are clearly not fulfilling their responsibilities. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=505.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm an Assembly member. I represent more than 100,000 people in western Queens. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=515.0s)]
*  In my office alone, we have helped more than 1,000 asylum seekers apply for city services, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=519.0s)]
*  responsibilities that should be getting fulfilled by our city, but we have a Mayor who's more intent on pointing fingers than actually picking up the work. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=525.0s)]
*  So what we would also do is ensure that we are advocating for a pathway to citizenship, that we are making clear that we need a humane immigration system. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=532.0s)]
*  And then we've had a Mayor who cancelled his trip to Washington because his fundraiser was being investigated by the Feds on the same day. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=540.0s)]
*  We need to have New York City as the number one priority, not federal charges. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=547.0s)]
*  So let's talk about some of the other issues that a Mayor would have to deal with. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=551.0s)]
*  Housing, a big issue for you. You've been an advocate on housing since before you were elected. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=556.0s)]
*  Is there a simple solution to the housing crisis in New York? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=561.0s)]
*  No, I don't think that there is a silver bullet. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=565.0s)]
*  I do think that there are clear and obvious answers to how we can start to get there. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=567.0s)]
*  One of them is the Mayor sets the rent for about two and a half million New Yorkers who live in rent stabilized units. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=571.0s)]
*  These are units that used to be the bedrock of economic security, and yet this Mayor has raised the rent by nine percent and counting. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=577.0s)]
*  We haven't seen those kinds of increases since a Republican was running City Hall. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=583.0s)]
*  The second thing is New York City and Boston are the two of the only cities in the United States that charge a broker's fee when people want to move from one apartment to another, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=587.0s)]
*  even if they haven't contracted a broker. We have a Mayor who's defending that system, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=596.0s)]
*  who is defending a system that has asked New Yorkers for up to ten, twenty thousand dollars to move. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=600.0s)]
*  And finally, what we need to do is build actually affordable housing. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=606.0s)]
*  We have a hundred percent publicly owned land. It's time that we put that to full use and make sure that New Yorkers can actually afford to live in those units. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=610.0s)]
*  Another big issue in this city this past year has been free speech. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=617.0s)]
*  What's been going on on college campuses, Columbia University in particular, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=621.0s)]
*  we saw the police deployed there with the support of the governor of the state, Democrat Kathy Hoca, with the support of the mayor of the city, Eric Adams, Democrat. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=624.0s)]
*  How would a Mayor Mamdani have treated the Columbia protests, the deployment of police, this entire free speech debate differently? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=633.0s)]
*  I would not have sent the police to Columbia or to CUNY. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=641.0s)]
*  What sending the police did is make that situation far more unsafe than it ever was under any kind of encampment. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=644.0s)]
*  When Mayor Adams sent those officers to Columbia, one of them discharged a weapon and almost killed a student. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=650.0s)]
*  If we as Democrats want to say that an elementary school, a middle school, a high school is more unsafe, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=656.0s)]
*  the more guns you have on that campus, why do we believe there's an exception when it comes to a university? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=662.0s)]
*  So what would you say to Jewish groups that were saying that Jewish students were being abandoned and targeted and harassed? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=667.0s)]
*  What would you have said at the time as mayor of the city? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=676.0s)]
*  I would have sat down with those very groups, listened to them, and see what are we speaking about that is with regards to sentiments around Israel [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=678.0s)]
*  and what are we seeing that is with regards to sentiments around being Jewish. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=687.0s)]
*  Attacking someone for being Jewish is unacceptable. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=691.0s)]
*  And yet so often what we see is that critiques of Israel as a state are then lumped into critiques of Judaism as a religion, when the two are fundamentally so. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=693.0s)]
*  And you're already being nicknamed the anti-Israel candidate by your opponents. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=702.0s)]
*  You actually spoke to Zateo contributor, award-winning actor and activist Cynthia Nixon a few weeks ago about some of the initiatives you pushed as an assembly member, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=706.0s)]
*  including trying to prevent charities from contributing to Israeli settlements. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=715.0s)]
*  You've been very critical of Israel. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=720.0s)]
*  Donald Trump ran a campaign where he reached out to a lot of Jewish voters in New York saying Democrats are anti-Israel and anti-Semitic. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=723.0s)]
*  It seems to have worked in some places like Williamsburg, Borough Hall. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=732.0s)]
*  Trump raked up I think 90, 95 percent of the votes in predominantly Jewish districts. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=735.0s)]
*  So he did much better in New York than he did nationwide with Jewish communities. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=739.0s)]
*  Are you worried that a candidate like yourself can't win in New York if you take the positions you take on Israel? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=742.0s)]
*  No, I actually think that there is a hunger across New York City for a politics of consistency for someone who stands up for the same things, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=747.0s)]
*  whether they apply to someone in Astoria or they apply to someone in Palestine or wherever they may be in the world. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=754.0s)]
*  Because for too long what we've seen is politicians create one set of rules one day and another set the other day, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=760.0s)]
*  and people are tired of that bankruptcy of leadership. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=766.0s)]
*  And Mayor Mamdani, would you welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu to New York City for whatever he comes for, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=769.0s)]
*  given the US is not a signatory to the ICC, so he can travel to the US, unlike a lot of other countries? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=776.0s)]
*  Would Mayor Mamdani welcome Benjamin Netanyahu to the city? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=782.0s)]
*  No, as Mayor New York City would arrest Benjamin Netanyahu, this is a city that our values are in line with international law. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=785.0s)]
*  It's time that our actions are also. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=792.0s)]
*  Even though the US is not a signatory to the ICC? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=793.0s)]
*  No, it's time that we actually step up and make clear what we are willing to do to showcase the leadership that is sorely missing in the federal administration. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=795.0s)]
*  It's going to be a tough uphill challenge for you to win this race. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=803.0s)]
*  You are young, and actually I don't think I ever went back to my original question. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=806.0s)]
*  Why do you think a 34-year-old can be mayor of a major city like New York? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=810.0s)]
*  You know, in the same way that when Michelle Wu ran to become the mayor of Boston when she was 35 years old, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=813.0s)]
*  what I think is missing in mayoralities is the understanding that to be a mayor is to be a messenger, a liaison, and a delegate. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=819.0s)]
*  In my time in state office, I have launched campaigns almost from scratch that have moved more than $100 million to invest into public transit, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=826.0s)]
*  to make our life more affordable for working class New Yorkers, and those are the things that I think I would bring to this kind of a position. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=835.0s)]
*  And this is something that in many other parts of the world we actually do see younger leadership that is at the helm of government, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=842.0s)]
*  and I think that it's important that we show that's also possible here in New York City. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=849.0s)]
*  So it will be an uphill struggle for you for sure. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=852.0s)]
*  You have secured the endorsement of the Democratic Socialists of America. You're a proud Democratic Socialist. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=855.0s)]
*  But there seems to be some divisions, even on the left, amongst progressives, Democrats, about your run. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=860.0s)]
*  Assemblymember Emily Gallagher expressed concern around you potentially becoming a spoiler candidate. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=866.0s)]
*  What is your response to people say that by you running you make it harder for other, more likely candidates to defeat Ariadne? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=871.0s)]
*  There are some people who say Adams won last time because the progressives split the vote. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=879.0s)]
*  Well, I think New York City is unique in that we have a ranked choice voting system. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=882.0s)]
*  So you cannot be a spoiler candidate in the traditional sense, where if you vote for me you can't vote for someone else. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=887.0s)]
*  You have five choices on your ballot. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=892.0s)]
*  And I think to the comment that you referred to, that's the beauty of internal debate, especially amongst the left. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=894.0s)]
*  When I was going through the process of being endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=899.0s)]
*  we were teasing through what are all the possibilities and also the things that we need to worry about. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=903.0s)]
*  And what I'm excited is that in the month since we have been in this race, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=907.0s)]
*  we have raised more than $265,000 for more than 2,600 people. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=912.0s)]
*  We are seeing a renewed enthusiasm for a politics that centers the working class. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=917.0s)]
*  And I think it will actually make it easier for everyone to defeat Eric Adams. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=921.0s)]
*  And I do believe that I will be able to do so as well. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=924.0s)]
*  You're on the left. You're a self-proclaimed socialist. You're an immigrant. You're a Muslim. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=927.0s)]
*  Some may say after the recent presidential election, you're what's wrong with the Democratic Party. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=932.0s)]
*  It's what a lot of centrists in your party will say. You've heard them say, we're captured by the far left. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=936.0s)]
*  Wokeness cost us the election. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=940.0s)]
*  What is your response to people who say that your wing of the party, people like you, cost Kamala Harris the election? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=942.0s)]
*  I would ask them who was running the Kamala Harris campaign. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=947.0s)]
*  What were the policies that were being run on? Who were the surrogates? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=949.0s)]
*  You are not going to see me in any one of these five boroughs with Liz Cheney or Mark Cuban backing away from taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=952.0s)]
*  Instead, I'm going to offer what's been missing, which is an alternative. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=960.0s)]
*  And I know that some of my identities have some of the worst PR in the world. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=963.0s)]
*  I'm also an Arsenal supporter, so I'm very intimate with that. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=966.0s)]
*  I will take that on the head. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=969.0s)]
*  And I think that it is time, though, that we trust New Yorkers for what they actually want to see. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=972.0s)]
*  And that is change. And that is a city that they can afford to live in. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=977.0s)]
*  What felt easier to you? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=980.0s)]
*  Asking New Yorkers to vote for you, first as Assemblymember, now to be Mayor, or asking them to buy the mixtape of your rapper alter ego, Mr. Cardamon? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=983.0s)]
*  I would say it's actually easier to get a vote than to sell a mixtape. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=993.0s)]
*  And that's why I am confident, because I have spent hours trying to sell music that probably shouldn't have been sold. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=997.0s)]
*  But now I can actually speak to New Yorkers about an economic agenda. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1004.0s)]
*  And your dad is a famous academic, Mahmood Mamdani, who I interviewed many years ago. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1008.0s)]
*  Your mom is an award-winning film director, Mira Nair, which I did not know until I prepared for this interview. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1014.0s)]
*  Many of us are big fans of Mira Nair. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1020.0s)]
*  Neither of those career tracks appeal to you? Bollywood, Hollywood, academia? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1022.0s)]
*  No, I thought I'd go for the bright lights of Albany. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1027.0s)]
*  You always wanted to be a politician? Because people might be suspicious about someone who studied for who always wanted to be a politician, but did a rapper diversion on the web. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1030.0s)]
*  You know, I would say if I had dreams of being a politician in this country, I wouldn't have co-founded a Students for Justice in Palestine chapter at my college. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1037.0s)]
*  I, in many ways, was preparing for a very different life. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1043.0s)]
*  But what I saw is that we have a city that's been abandoned by its political leadership. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1046.0s)]
*  And it's time that if we believe we have different ideas, let's put them to the test. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1051.0s)]
*  Will we see Zoran Mamdani rapping on the campaign trail, a la Vivek Ramaswami? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1054.0s)]
*  I'm just going to leave it at Inshallah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1059.0s)]
*  Is that a yes? Is that a no? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1061.0s)]
*  Bassem Youssef would say it's a no. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1063.0s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani, thank you for your time. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT96jhaHdIA&t=1065.0s)]
