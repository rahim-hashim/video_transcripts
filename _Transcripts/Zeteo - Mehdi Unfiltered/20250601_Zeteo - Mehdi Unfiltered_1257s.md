Video Description: Historian and author of the new bestseller 'America, América,' Greg Grandin, joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss what the US can learn from Latin America when it comes to fighting fascism, in this episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered.’ 
In his new best-selling book, America, América: A History of the New World, author and Yale University historian Greg Grandin highlights how Latin America has played a critical role in shaping the United States as we know it. And amid the rise of fascism, he argues that Latin America provides valuable lessons on how social democracy can combat right-wing authoritarianism.
In this episode, Grandin explains why the Democratic Party is struggling in providing a united front against Trump’s fascism. “You don’t beat fascists by calling fascists fascist. You beat fascists by offering an alternative and a broad vision of social democracy,” he tells Mehdi.

# Resisting Fascism: Lessons From the Front Lines of Latin America
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM)
*  How did we get from George Washington to Donald Trump? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=0.0s)]
*  When we think about US history, we often turn to what we learned [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=3.84s)]
*  in our textbooks, the Revolutionary War, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=6.54s)]
*  Independence from Britain, the Civil War, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=8.64s)]
*  even the role the US played in both world wars. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=10.78s)]
*  But this understanding of the US is incredibly Eurocentric [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  and leaves out a major piece of the puzzle [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=17.92s)]
*  that could help us better understand [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=20.36s)]
*  the historical moment we're living through. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=22.12s)]
*  As the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and author, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=24.42s)]
*  Greg Grandin, points out in his new book, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=27.3s)]
*  Latin America has played a critical role [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  in shaping the United States as we know it and vice versa. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=31.66s)]
*  In his new book that's called America, America, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=34.9s)]
*  A New History of the New World, Grandin walks us through [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=37.86s)]
*  how our southern neighbors have influenced the United States [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=40.7s)]
*  from the era of the conquistadors [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=43.04s)]
*  to the current moment we find ourselves in. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=44.54s)]
*  And amid the rise of fascism, he argues that Latin America [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  provides valuable lessons on how social democracy [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=49.82s)]
*  can combat right-wing authoritarianism. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=52.54s)]
*  Greg Grandin joins me now to discuss. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=55.42s)]
*  Greg, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=57.800000000000004s)]
*  Congratulations on the book and getting on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=59.84s)]
*  the New York Times bestseller list. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=61.92s)]
*  So much to talk about, but let's start here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=63.92s)]
*  When most people talk about America, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=66.62s)]
*  both here and across the world, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=69.42s)]
*  they are referring to the United States of America. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=71.26s)]
*  How do we get to that point? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=74.32s)]
*  Why is Latin America so overlooked? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, the word, I mean, to get back to the word, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=79.6s)]
*  is the United States claimed the word America [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  even as they understood the rest of the continent [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=86.32s)]
*  was also America. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=90.11999999999999s)]
*  And in the more expansionist visions of the founders, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=92.1s)]
*  they imagined that that part of America [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=95.44s)]
*  would also become their part of America. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=98.89999999999999s)]
*  There was more than one founder, including Thomas Jefferson, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  who thought both North and South America [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=105.28s)]
*  would be stacked with Saxons within 100 years [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=107.44s)]
*  as Latin America receded. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=111.78s)]
*  But the book is really a 500-year history, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=114.16s)]
*  starting with the conquest. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=117.34s)]
*  And in many ways, even though I couldn't get into it in depth [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=118.64s)]
*  because it was happening concurrently, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=124.64s)]
*  in some ways it ends with Gaza. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=127.08s)]
*  Because the through line of the book is, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=129.52s)]
*  there's many through lines of the book, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=134.26s)]
*  but one of them is Latin America's role [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=135.72s)]
*  in abrogating the doctrine of conquest. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=138.4s)]
*  So I start with the conquest, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=142.32s)]
*  and obviously we could bring it up to Gaza, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=144.22s)]
*  a different kind of conquest, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=146.46s)]
*  if I had had more time to write about it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=147.92s)]
*  But the book is about how the United States, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=150.29999999999998s)]
*  how Latin America has shaped the United States. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  But more than that, it's also how Latin America, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=155.9s)]
*  it's deep, and I'm gonna sound romantic and sentimental here, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=162.44s)]
*  but it's dehumanistic tradition, despite, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=166.98s)]
*  you know, and there's a tension throughout the book [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=171.34s)]
*  between the brutality of the conquest [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=173.48000000000002s)]
*  and the reaction to the brutality of the conquest, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=176.24s)]
*  and the criticism and the humanist critique [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=179.08s)]
*  that emerges from the conquest creates what we... [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=182.12s)]
*  Creates, my argument is that it creates [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=185.76s)]
*  basically the liberal international order. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=188.32s)]
*  It doesn't just shape the Americas [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=190.6s)]
*  or shape the United States. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=192.76s)]
*  You know, Latin America comes into the world [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=194.86s)]
*  already a league of nations, already a united nation, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=197.1s)]
*  six or seven republics that have to learn [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=200.68s)]
*  how to live with each other. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  It was unprecedented in history. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=204.46s)]
*  And the United States, of course, comes into the world [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=206.66s)]
*  a single nation on a continent that they imagined to be empty. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't empty, just, you know, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=213.6s)]
*  I'm saying imagined to be empty, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=217.2s)]
*  but, and they revived the doctrine of conquest [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=219.14s)]
*  to move west. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=221.84s)]
*  Latin America was rejecting the doctrine of conquest. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=222.84s)]
*  So the book is a sweeping book [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=225.92s)]
*  that deals with all of these issues [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=227.98s)]
*  that brings us up to the current moment [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=230.28s)]
*  in the sense that, you know, what Donald Trump [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=232.28s)]
*  is doing more than anything else [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=234.58s)]
*  is he's reasserting the doctrine of conquest. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=236.18s)]
*  I mean, you could say he's doing a lot of things, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=239.22s)]
*  but one principle core thing is when he says [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=241.22s)]
*  that the United States has a right to Greenland and Canada [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=245.42000000000002s)]
*  and that they, and they could use aggressive force [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=248.46s)]
*  to do that. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=251.0s)]
*  He's undoing centuries of work [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=252.0s)]
*  that were done within the new world [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=255.74s)]
*  to create the liberal international order [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=259.1s)]
*  put in place in 1945. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=263.16s)]
*  So you have this book. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=264.86s)]
*  You spent a lot of time working on this book, I'm sure. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=266.54s)]
*  And then it comes out at the start of the Trump presidency, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=269.04s)]
*  which as you say, he's reasserting [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  the doctrine of conquest. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=273.68s)]
*  He wants to panama canal back. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=274.64000000000004s)]
*  He's renaming the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of America. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=276.54s)]
*  How's that for some linguistic imperialism? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=279.52000000000004s)]
*  And he's also praising James Monroe [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  and the Monroe Doctrine in a recent ABC News interview. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  So your book couldn't be better timed, could it? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=287.78s)]
*  Yeah, it can't be better timed. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=291.62s)]
*  And there's so much going on. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=293.08s)]
*  My head's spinning because I don't know [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=294.42s)]
*  which op-ed to write first. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  What did you make of the Gulf of America renaming? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=298.42s)]
*  Well, it's been called the Gulf of America since 1550. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=302.96s)]
*  And I wrote something in The Guardian about this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=306.26s)]
*  It might as well be called the Gulf of America [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=309.3s)]
*  considering how much we polluted, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=311.9s)]
*  considering the amount of radiation [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=313.78s)]
*  that dredged up from offshore oil, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=316.32s)]
*  the toxicity that we've turned the Gulf of America. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  We might as well claim it of our own, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=323.56s)]
*  but setting that aside, this is two things. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  One is it's part of the culture war. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  And the key aspect of the culture war [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  is to constantly find new fronts to fight on. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=334.98s)]
*  There's never, it's always defined another thing. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  Plastic straws, slurpees, and the Gulf of America. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=340.86s)]
*  I mean, who even thought about that? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=345.24s)]
*  I mean, you must admit, Trump's kind of a genius. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=346.54s)]
*  Now it's Alcatraz. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=348.92s)]
*  But, you know, it's always a new thing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=350.38000000000005s)]
*  That's the culture war. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=353.32000000000005s)]
*  And so because the culture war is never about anything [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=354.56s)]
*  in particular, it's just about finding new things [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=357.42s)]
*  to attach resentment and grievances to. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=361.86s)]
*  It has no, it's inherently, it inherently escalates. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=364.3s)]
*  There is no end game to the culture war. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=369.94000000000005s)]
*  So, okay, to get back to the Gulf of America, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  you know, this is an argument in Trump's head, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=375.24s)]
*  and it speaks to the nature of the book. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=377.78000000000003s)]
*  Most Latin Americans call themselves Americans. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=379.78000000000003s)]
*  So, I mean, you could put an accent on the Gulf of America [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=383.32000000000005s)]
*  and everybody would be happy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=386.48s)]
*  But of course, Trump doesn't know that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=388.06s)]
*  You'll be supporting fearless, independent journalism. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=405.18s)]
*  On, you said, you know, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=408.18s)]
*  Latin Americans call themselves Americans, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=409.68s)]
*  and you talk about, you know, the kind of appearance [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=411.12s)]
*  of emptiness and the conquest and the movement. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=414.16s)]
*  Here's a question for you as someone who studied this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=416.86s)]
*  You look at Latin America today, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=419.06s)]
*  and you look at some of the social democratic parties [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=420.56s)]
*  and leftist leaders, both today and in recent decades, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=422.6s)]
*  who have come to power there [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=425.70000000000005s)]
*  and done some pretty impressive things, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=426.8s)]
*  done bad things as well, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  but some impressive social democratic things [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  in the fields of healthcare and education, the climate. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=430.98s)]
*  And then you look at the U.S., where that's never happened, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=433.85999999999996s)]
*  really, like, you have to go back to FDR [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=435.85999999999996s)]
*  to get even closer to kind of what Republicans [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=437.56s)]
*  like to call socialism. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=440.0s)]
*  How did the two parts of America diverge in that way? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, one is hospitable to social democracy and leftism, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=444.44s)]
*  and one traditionally isn't. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=447.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, it's a big question, and the book goes into it in depth, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=450.44s)]
*  which we don't have time to go into the weeds here. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=453.41999999999996s)]
*  I think there's a, you know, the social and intellectual history [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=456.08s)]
*  of Spanish Catholicism compared to British Protestantism. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=460.74s)]
*  There's a certain invasion, evasion, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=464.84000000000003s)]
*  and it built into the British colonial project [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=467.68s)]
*  that didn't deal with social problems [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=472.88000000000005s)]
*  that pushed them to the frontier, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  where Spanish Catholicism, for all of its horrors [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=477.0s)]
*  and all of its, you know, creating a colonial state [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=481.06s)]
*  that extracted the New World's wealth and brought it back, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=485.1s)]
*  you know, and created enormous miseries [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  and led to the greatest human mortality rate in world history, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  90% of the New World population gone within a century. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=497.7s)]
*  For all of that, for all of those miseries, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  there was a kind of moral crisis within the Catholic Church, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=505.29999999999995s)]
*  because the Catholic Church presumed to be universal, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=509.2s)]
*  and once it recognized Native Americans as humans, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=512.38s)]
*  how do you justify that? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=515.98s)]
*  And, you know, and this, you know, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=518.42s)]
*  and it created a more direct grappling [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=520.02s)]
*  with the problems of society. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=523.98s)]
*  Like, there was, like, and so one of the book's main tensions, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=526.56s)]
*  and we don't have time to go into all of the ways [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=531.1999999999999s)]
*  that the intellectual ideas, the ideas integrated [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=534.76s)]
*  with the social history of exploitation and capitalism, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=539.34s)]
*  but one of the main ideas is that Latin America [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  is the origins of what we call social rights, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=545.68s)]
*  what we call the right to educate, you know, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=549.48s)]
*  what we call the right, you know, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=551.52s)]
*  the obligation of a state to deliver basic goods [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=554.16s)]
*  to create a dignified life, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=558.3s)]
*  whereas the United States is the last bastion [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=560.16s)]
*  of individual rights. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=564.46s)]
*  No other country in the world, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=565.9s)]
*  especially rich countries, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=568.8s)]
*  have clung to a notion of individual rights [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  as fetishistically as the United States does. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=576.4599999999999s)]
*  And by individual rights, I mean that, you know, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=579.9s)]
*  the only legitimate state is the state that restrains itself [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=583.5s)]
*  and allows individuals a greater realm of liberty [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=587.1s)]
*  to assemble, to believe, to speak, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=590.64s)]
*  you know, some say to own guns. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=593.9399999999999s)]
*  You know, there's nothing in the U.S. Constitution [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=596.14s)]
*  about the state providing health care, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=598.54s)]
*  providing education. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=600.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, and that tension between social rights [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=602.02s)]
*  and individual rights is mocked and acute, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=606.02s)]
*  and it's a good framework for understanding the distinction [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=610.66s)]
*  between Latin America and the United States, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=614.22s)]
*  and that's something I try to draw out. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=616.9s)]
*  You know, the Good Neighbor Policy and FDR [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=619.6s)]
*  was probably the highest moment of convergence [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=622.16s)]
*  when the United States began to accept the right [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=626.0s)]
*  to social rights. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=630.04s)]
*  Some of FDR's brain trusters said, you know, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=632.04s)]
*  we don't really have to amend the Constitution. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=635.88s)]
*  We could read it in a different way. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=638.06s)]
*  We could read the right to life [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=640.02s)]
*  to mean the right to a healthy life. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=641.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=643.52s)]
*  Meaning a lot of the right to health care. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=644.76s)]
*  And they had the economic bill of rights as well, didn't they? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=646.3s)]
*  But, you know, the right in this country since the 1970s [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=647.76s)]
*  has been engaged in a massive ideological campaign [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=651.9s)]
*  to reconsecrate individual rights. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=656.18s)]
*  And cast social rights as perverse and heretical. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=659.5s)]
*  And that's a big tension in the book. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=664.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, so it's Bernie Sanders. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=668.22s)]
*  When Bernie Sanders, we're the only country in the world [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=669.62s)]
*  that doesn't have a national health system. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=671.76s)]
*  What he means by that is the, what he means by that is, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=675.4200000000001s)]
*  the bigger thing is, what he means by that is, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=678.7s)]
*  we're the only country in the world [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=680.6s)]
*  that doesn't believe in social rights. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=681.76s)]
*  So it's interesting that you mentioned [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=683.5600000000001s)]
*  kind of other rich countries, but, okay, we've got Canada. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=686.3000000000001s)]
*  Which, you know, Bernie often points to [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=689.32s)]
*  for its health care system right next door to us. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=691.2s)]
*  Having trouble with Canada these days, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  thanks to our president. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=695.0s)]
*  But then you have Mexico to the south. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=696.1s)]
*  Mexico just elected a woman president, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=698.1s)]
*  a leftist president, Claudia Scheinbaum, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=700.64s)]
*  to lead the country. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=703.0s)]
*  The United States at almost the same time [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=704.3000000000001s)]
*  is electing a convicted felon, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=706.64s)]
*  a far-right authoritarian, Donald Trump. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=708.88s)]
*  How do we begin to reckon with the difference [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=712.62s)]
*  between Mexico and the U.S. right now? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=716.1600000000001s)]
*  Right, literally side by side, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  you couldn't have a starker difference [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=721.26s)]
*  between the two leaders. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=722.86s)]
*  Well, the Mexican Revolution, the Mexican Revolution, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=725.46s)]
*  you know, the Mexican Revolution, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=728.6s)]
*  which more or less, and not exactly, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=729.96s)]
*  corresponded with the Good Neighbor Policy. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=732.14s)]
*  And it was that moment of conversion, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=734.6s)]
*  of reform, of creating states that broke away [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=736.48s)]
*  from extreme obsessive liberalism [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=740.44s)]
*  and began to imagine the kind of building out [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=744.1800000000001s)]
*  of a social state in different ways, in different ways. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=747.46s)]
*  You know, Cardenas in Mexico gave so much land [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=750.4s)]
*  back to the Yaqui. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=753.9399999999999s)]
*  It would have been the equivalent of FDR [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=755.48s)]
*  if he had given back, like, Tennessee back to the Creeks, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=757.88s)]
*  which of course would never have happened. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=762.48s)]
*  But they did that in Mexico. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=764.12s)]
*  Now, Mexico and the United States [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=766.22s)]
*  both suffered economic restructuring in the 70s, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=768.08s)]
*  and Mexico's revolution was kind of lost to some degree. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=771.92s)]
*  But what we see with Claudia Steinbaum [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=776.48s)]
*  and what we see with the president that preceded her, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=778.52s)]
*  AMLO, is a return to the values of the Mexican Revolution [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=782.0s)]
*  in a successful way. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=786.4s)]
*  People constantly hear talk about returning [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=788.4s)]
*  to the values of the New Deal. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=791.1999999999999s)]
*  They're doing it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=794.1999999999999s)]
*  Like, here, it never actually happens, right? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=795.74s)]
*  We talk about the New Deal, but it never actually gets there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=797.9399999999999s)]
*  The thing about Latin America is it has this commitment [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=801.48s)]
*  to a kind of universalism. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=805.36s)]
*  I mean, without romanticizing, without sentimentalism, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=807.14s)]
*  you know, the crime and corruption, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=812.28s)]
*  people are desperate to poverty, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=814.18s)]
*  and the Cold War violence was off the charts. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=816.48s)]
*  But they never give up on this conception of democracy, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=820.62s)]
*  at least in spirit, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  Even if any given country might go any given way [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  in an election. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=831.3199999999999s)]
*  For every Mexico, there's an El Salvador. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=832.64s)]
*  For every Brazil, there's now an Ecuador. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=835.9799999999999s)]
*  So on that note, Greg, on that note, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=839.1199999999999s)]
*  it's interesting that you can look at social democracy [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=841.6199999999999s)]
*  in Latin America, but you can also look [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=843.9599999999999s)]
*  at the history of fascism, right? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=845.3599999999999s)]
*  You know, the classic hunters, the generals, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=847.8199999999999s)]
*  you know, we have this image of kind of tin pot dictatorships [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=850.3599999999999s)]
*  often comes out of Latin America, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=853.66s)]
*  the phrase banana republic, all of that stuff [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=855.1999999999999s)]
*  that comes out of, you know, you mentioned the Cold War violence. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=858.0999999999999s)]
*  And even today, you mentioned culture wars earlier. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=860.74s)]
*  You have Millet in Argentina, Bukele, obviously, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=863.6400000000001s)]
*  in El Salvador, mimicking Trump in their own ways. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=866.08s)]
*  And yet you do have a history of resistance to fascism [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=869.5200000000001s)]
*  and overcoming the Pinochés and others. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=873.4200000000001s)]
*  So what can Americans, Americans in North America, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  in the United States of America, what can they learn [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=879.22s)]
*  from Latin Americans in terms of resisting fascism? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=881.46s)]
*  What lessons can they learn from Latin American history [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=884.4000000000001s)]
*  that might be useful right now in the U.S. in 2025? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=886.46s)]
*  Well, the contexts are different. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=890.74s)]
*  They can't just mimic what client-shine bomb are doing. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=892.44s)]
*  The countries are very different. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=895.94s)]
*  But one thing that they can do is Latin American [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=897.24s)]
*  social democrats know that the way that you can't, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=901.1400000000001s)]
*  you don't be fascist by calling fascist fascist. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=905.1400000000001s)]
*  You be fascist by offering an alternative, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=908.46s)]
*  you know, a broad vision of social democracy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=911.9000000000001s)]
*  You promise to make the material conditions [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=915.32s)]
*  of people's lives better in real ways. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=917.86s)]
*  And that if liberalism is going to be revived [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=920.82s)]
*  from its near-Moroban state, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=926.96s)]
*  the only way it's gonna be revived is by welding it, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=930.3000000000001s)]
*  as Latin Americans consistently do, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=933.96s)]
*  to a robust program of social rights, unapologetic, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=936.24s)]
*  unapologetic social rights that, you know, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=941.74s)]
*  that we all, you know, that it's the government's job [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  to create universal programs that improve people's lives. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=948.44s)]
*  Now, again, Latin America is a poor region. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=951.44s)]
*  It's, you know, it's not Scandinavia. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=954.08s)]
*  It doesn't have no, you know, it has a lot of, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=956.88s)]
*  there's a lot of things that, there's a lot of crime [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=960.02s)]
*  and there's a lot of fallback. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=961.96s)]
*  But the one thing that Latin American, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=963.86s)]
*  Latin Americans have been fighting fascism, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=966.22s)]
*  the World War II didn't end after, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=969.16s)]
*  after in 1945 for Latin Americans. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=973.76s)]
*  It just migrated back to Latin America. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=976.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean, they've been fighting fascists throughout, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=979.16s)]
*  you know, since World War I. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=981.3s)]
*  In some ways, the United States globalized fascism [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=983.16s)]
*  with the Cold War. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=986.74s)]
*  And by, you know, during the Good Neighbor Policy, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=988.14s)]
*  the U.S. supported the left against the right [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=991.0799999999999s)]
*  to great and enormous and wondrous success on many levels. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=993.9799999999999s)]
*  The Cold War came and the U.S. switched [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=998.78s)]
*  and the result was catastrophic. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1001.52s)]
*  And we've never really had a reckoning with that, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1003.7199999999999s)]
*  I think, as well. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1005.5799999999999s)]
*  I think most Americans have no clue [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1006.64s)]
*  about what happened in Guatemala or Chile or... [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1008.38s)]
*  No, in Chile and everything, you know. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1012.12s)]
*  And, but despite that violence and despite the depredations [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1015.16s)]
*  of economic restructuring, what we call neoliberalism, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1020.52s)]
*  you know, Latin Americans never listened to, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1024.36s)]
*  you know, the followers of Hayek. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1027.36s)]
*  They never seemed to, they never seemed to come to believe [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1029.0s)]
*  that national health insurance... [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1032.2s)]
*  Although we now have this libertarian, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1034.1s)]
*  libertarian dude in Argentina, don't we? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1036.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because there has been a massive importation [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1039.1799999999998s)]
*  of the culture wars into Latin America. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  Last question, Greg. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1044.9199999999998s)]
*  Towards the end of the book, you write, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1046.08s)]
*  Wilson imagined a world without war. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1047.78s)]
*  FDR imagined a world without fear or want. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1049.6599999999999s)]
*  Today's political class imagines nothing. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1052.02s)]
*  Its grand strategists do no better than offer [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1054.12s)]
*  perilous talk of a new Cold War of restarting nuclear testing, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1055.9599999999998s)]
*  abrogating disarmament treaties, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1059.3s)]
*  rearming Germany and Japan, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1060.8999999999999s)]
*  expanding NATO and garrisoning Africa. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  I just wonder, do you have any faith [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1064.7s)]
*  in the current Democratic Party [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1066.76s)]
*  to have some moral political imagination [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1068.5600000000002s)]
*  that fires people up that helps beat fascism? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1071.9s)]
*  Well, there's these three currents, right? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1075.94s)]
*  There's the Bernie Sanders and AOC current, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1078.7800000000002s)]
*  and we could criticize them for their timidity on Gaza. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1081.68s)]
*  But they do have a vision. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1086.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean, you know, Holland, you know, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1087.48s)]
*  Medicare for all is exactly what I'm talking about. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1091.3s)]
*  Then there's the people who say, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1094.88s)]
*  we should just fight, like Pritzker. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1096.48s)]
*  But fight for what? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1098.42s)]
*  You have to fight for something. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1099.92s)]
*  You can't just say you have to fight. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1101.68s)]
*  And there's a lot of those people. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1104.26s)]
*  We have to fight. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1106.26s)]
*  But okay, but come up with a program to fight for. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  And then there's the technocrats, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1110.0s)]
*  the abundance people. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1111.9s)]
*  You know, New York Times ran an article about how the Democrats [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1114.3600000000001s)]
*  Democrats need a new, a Plan 2029 of their own. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1117.9199999999998s)]
*  And I was like, oh yeah, this is it. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1122.8999999999999s)]
*  This is what I've been waiting for. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1124.5s)]
*  What's going to be in this plan? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1125.8999999999999s)]
*  National health insurance, universal child care, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1127.54s)]
*  paid maternity leave. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1131.6399999999999s)]
*  No, none of those things. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1133.3799999999999s)]
*  The Plan 2029 was the United, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1135.3799999999999s)]
*  the government had to learn how to deregulate [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1138.58s)]
*  and deliver service more efficiently, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A8iXW6mdAM&t=1142.3799999999999s)]
