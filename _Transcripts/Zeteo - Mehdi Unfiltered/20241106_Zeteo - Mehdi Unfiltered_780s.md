# "Inevitable disaster": How Not Breaking with Biden on Gaza Broke Kamala Harris's Campaign
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI)
*  So, Kamala Harris lost, Donald Trump won. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=0.0s)]
*  We are going to spend a lot of time figuring out what was behind this big Trump win. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=3.0s)]
*  But for a lot of people, the genocide in Gaza was a red line and that was one of the big [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  reasons they believe Kamala Harris lost. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=11.76s)]
*  To talk more about the role that Gaza may have played in all of this, I am joined by [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=13.76s)]
*  Youssef Maniah, who is with the Arab Center in Washington, D.C., very well known Palestinian-American [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=16.64s)]
*  political analyst. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=22.12s)]
*  Youssef, what role? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=23.12s)]
*  Just jump straight in. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=25.0s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=26.0s)]
*  What role did Gaza play in this crazy election? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah, well thank you for having me, Mahdi. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=28.88s)]
*  Look, I think there has been a lot of attention on the Arab and Muslim vote. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=31.56s)]
*  And while I think that is important because of certain concentrations of the Arab and [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=37.56s)]
*  Muslim community, in particular places like Michigan, where they can have an outsized [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=41.56s)]
*  impact, that is not the only place and way that Gaza had an impact on this election. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=45.68s)]
*  And I think it did. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=51.56s)]
*  And we should be clear, no one issue determined the outcome of this election. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=52.56s)]
*  Several issues combined helped push it in one direction. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=57.16s)]
*  I have been most concerned when looking at how this is going to work out for Kamala Harris [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=61.0s)]
*  about the youth vote more than anything else when it comes to Gaza. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=66.4s)]
*  Time and time again we have seen in the polls that it is the youngest demographic of Americans, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=70.52s)]
*  the youngest demographic of American voters, who are most outraged over this policy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=74.88s)]
*  And we have also seen polls that suggested that swing state voters, and younger swing [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=79.6s)]
*  state voters in particular, would actually be more likely to vote for Harris over this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  In 2020, the youngest demographic went to Biden, the under 29 vote, by the largest margin [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=90.16s)]
*  in history. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  And they came out in larger numbers than ever before. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  This is where I think actually the vote that cared about Gaza had a bigger impact than [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=105.44s)]
*  anything else. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=111.92s)]
*  We saw a decline in the margin for Harris among that demographic. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=113.76s)]
*  And we also saw a drop in turnout in that demographic as well. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=117.6s)]
*  And that had an impact, not just in Michigan, but it probably had an impact in Wisconsin, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=122.12s)]
*  it probably had an impact in Pennsylvania, and other places that were really important [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=127.8s)]
*  for Harris to win to have a chance at winning this campaign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=132.68s)]
*  So clearly you're right, it had an impact. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=135.72s)]
*  I think in Michigan the margins are so tight now, maybe she could have won Michigan if [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  the Arab vote hadn't collapsed and the Muslim vote collapsed. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=142.2s)]
*  The problem is of course she didn't just lose Michigan, she lost all the swing states. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=144.36s)]
*  And she almost lost states like New Jersey, New York, well not almost lost, but the narrowest [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=148.72s)]
*  margins we've seen in a generation in solidly blue states. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=152.72s)]
*  So when I see a lot of Palestinian activist supporters online saying, see, Gaza cost you [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=155.4s)]
*  the election, that's not quite true. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=160.24s)]
*  Well again, how you isolate the specific impact of this one thing is complicated, because [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=162.8s)]
*  again it's not just Arab and Muslim voters. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=167.88s)]
*  But if I turn it around and say if she'd come out as we wanted her to for an arms embargo, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=169.56s)]
*  she still would have lost looking at these numbers. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=174.68s)]
*  I'm not so sure about that. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=177.08s)]
*  The reason I think that it's more complicated than that is because the biggest challenge [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=178.68s)]
*  that Harris had, look, we all knew that the Biden re-election campaign was a slow motion [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=183.6s)]
*  train wreck. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=189.56s)]
*  And they understood that as well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=191.04s)]
*  That's why they switched candidates, right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  The problem was, instead of shifting to a different track. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  She just became the conductor on the same line, headed to inevitable disaster, right? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=199.72s)]
*  She failed to show that there would be a real difference between her and Joe Biden and how [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=205.08s)]
*  she would govern. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=209.42000000000002s)]
*  And one of the ways that she reinforced that perception was by repeating the same lines [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=210.88s)]
*  on Israel policy that the Biden administration had. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=217.02s)]
*  And again, this is not the only issue where she failed to create a difference by Biden, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=220.48s)]
*  but on an issue that has outraged so many people. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=224.96s)]
*  It again reinforced this idea that this is more of the same. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=227.56s)]
*  This was a change election. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  The Democrats had a tremendous opportunity to make their candidate about change, but [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=233.04s)]
*  they made them about continuity instead. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=239.04s)]
*  So I agree with a lot of what you're saying. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  My worry from the beginning has been the political strategy, if I can call it that, behind some [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=243.72s)]
*  of the Muslim and Arab American groups who came out and endorsed Jill Stein or said, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=248.16s)]
*  abandon Harris. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=252.12s)]
*  A lot of them were telling me that if Harris loses, she'll be forced to listen to us. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=253.12s)]
*  We will have leverage. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=257.2s)]
*  And I said to them, that's not how the Democratic Party works. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=258.2s)]
*  Unfortunately, they don't move to the left after they lose. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  They move to the right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=263.68s)]
*  It's what they did in 2016. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=264.68s)]
*  It's what they've always done. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=265.68s)]
*  Even we're speaking the day after the election. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=267.44s)]
*  Just this morning, you had people saying it's because we're too left wing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  We were too pro-trans. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=272.0s)]
*  A lot of Democrats saying we need to shift. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=273.0s)]
*  I don't think the Democratic Party is going to improve its position on Palestine tomorrow, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=275.5s)]
*  next week, anytime soon as a result of this election result. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=279.4s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=282.0s)]
*  Well, I think what's going to have to happen now is there's going to be a very, very, there's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=283.0s)]
*  going to need to be a very deep introspection among Democratic Party strategists about what [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=286.88s)]
*  happened here. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=291.48s)]
*  They have a very difficult challenge as a party in trying to keep together a large and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=292.78s)]
*  fractious and diverse coalition of voters. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=297.94s)]
*  And they didn't do that successfully this time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  They lost in a lot of places with groups that they normally do better with, right? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=304.32s)]
*  And part of that was people who care about Palestine. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=309.74s)]
*  Look, most people who care about this issue probably voted for Biden in 2020. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=313.12s)]
*  And they didn't come out and do that for Harris, along with millions of other people, by the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=318.56s)]
*  way. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=322.68s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=323.68s)]
*  You said most people who care about this issue probably voted for Biden. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=324.68s)]
*  You're right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=326.12s)]
*  You look at the numbers yesterday in Michigan, you look at the election day voters, and these [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=327.12s)]
*  are not final numbers. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  They're going to change. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=331.84000000000003s)]
*  But election day numbers in Dearborn, Michigan, the capital of Arab America, 45 percent Donald [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=333.0s)]
*  Trump, 15 percent Kamala Harris, I think Jill Stein in the 30s. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=338.96s)]
*  Trump getting three times as many votes as Harris in Dearborn. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=343.08s)]
*  And he went to Dearborn. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=346.32s)]
*  To be fair to him, Harris wouldn't step foot in Dearborn. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=347.32s)]
*  He went to Dearborn. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=349.28s)]
*  But the idea that Arab Americans didn't just reject Harris for understandable reasons, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=350.79999999999995s)]
*  but embrace Trump? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  Isn't that insane? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=356.2s)]
*  As an Arab American, aren't you stunned to see that number? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=357.2s)]
*  I think that if Americans always voted in their political and economic interests, you [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=359.88s)]
*  wouldn't have successful Republican candidates, right? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=365.08s)]
*  The entire theory of the case for Republicans is getting huge amounts of people to vote [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=368.08000000000004s)]
*  against their interests, especially their economic interests. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  So you're saying including Arab Americans? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  Of course, including Arab Americans. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=376.68s)]
*  By the way, Arab American voters are diverse. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=378.24s)]
*  They're not monolithic. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=381.12s)]
*  They don't just vote on one issue. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=382.12s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of Palestinian Americans in Chicago as well, and that went solidly for [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=385.64000000000004s)]
*  Harris. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=389.88s)]
*  So, you know, there's a lot of different ways to look at this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=390.88s)]
*  The more important question, though, is why, as a campaign, did the Harris camp cede this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=393.84s)]
*  opportunity to Trump when all of the warning signs were flashing on the importance of this [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=401.53999999999996s)]
*  issue? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=407.88s)]
*  And she didn't have to come out with a revolutionary different policy on this, but to send the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=408.88s)]
*  message that there was going to be some difference. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=414.88s)]
*  And I think the biggest impact this had is not in the few people that voted for Donald [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=419.0s)]
*  Trump, but in the much larger number of people who felt that both of these candidates were [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=423.84s)]
*  horrible on this issue and didn't deserve their vote. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=429.76s)]
*  And of course, Donald Trump at least pretended to give it out, right? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=433.8s)]
*  That's what he's a master of. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=437.04s)]
*  And he went to Dearborn. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=438.04s)]
*  He went to Dearborn. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=439.04s)]
*  You know, where Harris didn't. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=440.04s)]
*  He said, I'm the anti-war guy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=441.04s)]
*  Liz Cheney's a warmonger. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=442.28s)]
*  I'll save Muslims. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=443.48s)]
*  I'll give you peace. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=444.48s)]
*  Obviously, he's a bullshitter. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=445.48s)]
*  But he said it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=446.48s)]
*  He pretended, which she wouldn't do. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=448.16s)]
*  Jill Stein was very popular in Arab American communities in the last few months. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=450.04s)]
*  I got attacked a lot for doing a very tough interview with her on Zateo from a lot of [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=453.48s)]
*  Muslim and Arab Americans. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=457.36s)]
*  In the end, she didn't get the most votes in Michigan. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=458.92s)]
*  Nationally, I think she's at 1 percent. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=461.32000000000005s)]
*  She got nowhere near the 5 percent that the Greens were hoping she would get. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=463.96000000000004s)]
*  Where does, where are we left in terms of third party politics? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=467.16s)]
*  There was a lot of energy around the idea of a third party because of Garza. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  Didn't really work out again. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  I think that most people who cast their vote for Jill Stein were casting a protest vote [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=475.36s)]
*  against the Democratic Party. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=480.2s)]
*  And I think most people who cast protest votes didn't vote for Jill Stein. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=483.12s)]
*  They did it by either not voting or writing in something completely different or voting [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=487.76s)]
*  down ballot and not voting for the presidential candidate. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=494.52s)]
*  But the bigger question is, again, we knew this was coming. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=498.28s)]
*  That lane was left open. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=504.8s)]
*  That opportunity was seeded. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=506.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=508.2s)]
*  And I want to say about the Liz Cheney thing, by the way, because there was a clear strategy [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=509.2s)]
*  here on the part of the Harris campaign. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=513.36s)]
*  And that approach was, look, there are a couple hundred thousand people in Michigan who in [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=516.28s)]
*  the Republican primary voted for Nikki. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=522.32s)]
*  Let's go get those voters. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=525.8s)]
*  Let's appeal to those. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=527.32s)]
*  There's no evidence. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=528.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=529.32s)]
*  The evidence that we have every election is that the most important determining factor [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  in voting outcomes is party identification. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  Republicans vote for Republicans. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=540.5200000000001s)]
*  Democrats vote for Democrats. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=542.48s)]
*  Why the strategy was, hey, let's see the anti-war lane. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  Let's see the Palestine stuff. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=547.84s)]
*  Let's ignore this and try to go after people who are never going to vote for us to begin [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=549.32s)]
*  with. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=553.6400000000001s)]
*  This is a serious question that strategists need to ask themselves. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=554.7600000000001s)]
*  And they're doubling down, as I say. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=557.96s)]
*  People who thought that they were going to suddenly shift to the left, you have people [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=559.4399999999999s)]
*  like Richie Torres, pro-Israel Democrat in New York, very emboldened today, tweeting [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=561.76s)]
*  that this is the far-left's fault. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=565.56s)]
*  We need to abandon the far-left. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=567.52s)]
*  So perhaps the problem was that Cheney wasn't the candidate herself. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=568.76s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=571.92s)]
*  Let's look forward. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=573.64s)]
*  Donald Trump will be president on January 20, 2025. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=574.64s)]
*  What happens to Gaza? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=577.36s)]
*  What happens to the West Bank with Miriam Adelson pushing him to annex the West Bank [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=578.36s)]
*  with David Friedman, his former ambassador, whose annexation has probably been given a [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=581.48s)]
*  big job? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=585.16s)]
*  Jared Kushner, who says Gaza has great beachfront property back in the White House. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  How bad is it going to get for Palestinians in 2025? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=590.52s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to continue to get worse. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=592.6s)]
*  That's not really going to be a function of who's in the White House. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=598.12s)]
*  You don't think it'll be worse because of Trump and the people who... [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  No, I think it's going to get worse, but that is not going to be a function of who is in [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  the White House. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=607.12s)]
*  I think this administration, the Biden administration, has effectively ceded the driver's seat to [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=608.12s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu as it is. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=614.2s)]
*  And I don't expect that to be that much different with Trump in power. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=617.8s)]
*  Where I do think it'll be interesting is if Netanyahu being in the driver's seat brings [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=623.24s)]
*  the United States into direct confrontation with Iran in some significant way. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=630.6s)]
*  That would actually go against some of the things that Trump said and talked about in [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=636.4s)]
*  his campaign. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=639.72s)]
*  He's not beholden to anyone anymore because, at least as I understand it, he's not allowed [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=641.4399999999999s)]
*  to run again unless they go and change the laws, like many sort of... [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=645.24s)]
*  Or ignore the laws. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=650.76s)]
*  Or ignore the laws, as many authoritarians around the world have done when they're told [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=651.76s)]
*  their time is up. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  But I don't see a huge difference in terms of American policy between these two campaigns. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=657.52s)]
*  And most people who are looking at Palestine, I think, see it the same way. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=664.52s)]
*  Nobody could have imagined the depth of anti-Palestinian hatred that came from the Biden administration. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=671.16s)]
*  So I've been agreeing with a lot of what you say. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=677.16s)]
*  I think you're going to see much more anti-Palestinian hatred coming forward, and I think we will [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=678.72s)]
*  see a difference. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=682.08s)]
*  But I hope to be proven wrong. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=683.08s)]
*  Last question. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=684.52s)]
*  Give us some hope. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=685.52s)]
*  I remember when Jamal Bowman and Cori Bush were defeated by AIPAC dollars in their primaries. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=686.52s)]
*  You did a tweet, if memory serves me correctly, saying, actually, there's some good news here. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=691.18s)]
*  This is a sign of strength. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=694.8s)]
*  Lay out for us any kind of hope that you see in the campaign for Palestinian rights in the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=696.0s)]
*  U.S. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=699.36s)]
*  I think the future is brighter precisely because it is younger folks who are leading the way [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=700.4s)]
*  on this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=708.96s)]
*  But what we have seen in this election over the past year is that a lot of people with [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=710.88s)]
*  a tremendous amount of money who are heavily invested in the American political process, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=716.12s)]
*  Miriam Adelson gave Trump $100 million. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=721.72s)]
*  AIPAC put $100 million into Democratic primary campaigns alone. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  That is a major obstacle. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=729.76s)]
*  But continuing to keep U.S. policy in the direction that it is as it relates to Israel [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=731.92s)]
*  is only getting more expensive because it is getting more unpopular. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's going to stop. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=740.4399999999999s)]
*  And I think one of the things that we may very well see among Democrats with this Trump [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=741.96s)]
*  administration is that they may rediscover that there's a problem with this kind of support [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=748.08s)]
*  for Israel in the way that we saw more during the first Trump administration. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=753.16s)]
*  We will see. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=759.26s)]
*  Yusuf Benaia, thank you for your analysis today. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=760.26s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=762.0600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=763.0600000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tFVETCaOI&t=764.0600000000001s)]
