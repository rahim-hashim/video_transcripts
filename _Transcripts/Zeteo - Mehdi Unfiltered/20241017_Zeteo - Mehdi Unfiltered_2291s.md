# 'Sheer HYPOCRISY' on Gaza: Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim Blasts The West
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI)
*  Is he complicit in those war crimes? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=0.0s)]
*  Is he complicit in the genocide that you have identified in Gaza? [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1.52s)]
*  From Joe Biden? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=8.16s)]
*  Do you support holding Hamas to account as well? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=11.84s)]
*  Many people believe what's happening in Xinjiang with the Uyghurs is also a genocide. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=30.0s)]
*  What do you say to Malaysian Muslims, including Malaysian political parties, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=60.0s)]
*  who say they want to bring in hudud punishment, the stonings, the beatings, the lashings? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=64.4s)]
*  What is the future of that in Malaysia? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=69.36s)]
*  That was a very provocative question. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=70.88s)]
*  I don't know anything about provocative questions. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=73.12s)]
*  It's one of the most remarkable stories in modern day global politics. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=82.08s)]
*  I'm talking about the political journey of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=85.84s)]
*  who from early on in his career was always expected to become Malaysian Prime Minister. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  That was until 1999, when his very own mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=94.16s)]
*  imprisoned him on false charges of sodomy and corruption. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=99.36s)]
*  After kicking Anwar out of the government and watching him lead Malaysia's opposition movement, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=102.64s)]
*  Anwar was eventually released in 2004, only to be imprisoned by the government again 10 years later, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=107.52s)]
*  after getting thousands of Malaysians to protest what many saw as a corrupt government election. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=112.96s)]
*  Today, Anwar has gone from sitting in solitary confinement to sitting in the highest seat of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=118.16s)]
*  Malaysian politics, after winning the premiership in 2022 at the right age of 75. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=122.64s)]
*  Under his tenure, Anwar is attempting to turn Malaysia into an economic powerhouse, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=128.96s)]
*  as well as standing up to the West on Gaza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=133.68s)]
*  The Prime Minister has been perhaps one of the most vocal critics of Israel's genocide in Gaza, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=136.56s)]
*  though some worry that Anwar has maybe taken his support for Palestine too far, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=141.2s)]
*  after he met with and even praised leaders of Hamas. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=144.88s)]
*  For Zateo, I went to Kuala Lumpur to sit down with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=148.48s)]
*  for a wide-ranging and challenging interview on the future of Malaysia, democracy, Islam and, yes, Gaza. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=153.2s)]
*  Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, welcome to Zateo. Thank you for doing this interview. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=165.12s)]
*  Thank you, Madi. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=169.04s)]
*  It was about 30 years ago that you became Deputy Prime Minister under Mahathir Mohamed. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=170.32s)]
*  You were seen as the person who would one day take over the premiership of Malaysia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=174.72s)]
*  But it hasn't been an easy journey for you. You were imprisoned twice on bogus charges. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=178.96s)]
*  You faced beatings, torture in prison. And when you were eventually released from prison in 2018, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=183.28s)]
*  you came back towards power but were denied it again in 2020. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=188.72s)]
*  You're now finally Prime Minister. You have been for almost two years now. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=193.12s)]
*  What does it feel like to finally be in this position, to be in the Prime Minister residence? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=197.44s)]
*  Well, you are in the position to execute most of your policies. I mean, there's immense pleasure [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=203.6s)]
*  that one can have. Although there are challenges, but I'm more assertive, confident that we can do [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=210.4s)]
*  it. We have been doing it in the last two years. What are you most proud of having executed since [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=217.92s)]
*  2022? Good governance. I think in countries, developing countries, most countries for that matter, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=223.84s)]
*  Muslim countries, included the issue of poor governance, endemic corruption. And [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=229.04s)]
*  we have experienced that too, more systematic and systemic corruption in the last decades. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=236.0s)]
*  And I think it is our duty to clean up the mess. So you talk about cleaning up the mess. Before we [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  get to that, just big picture Malaysia. This is a multicultural, multiracial, multi-faith country, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=248.56s)]
*  Muslim majority, Islam mentioned in the constitution. What is your vision for Malaysia? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=254.88s)]
*  What do you want the world to know, our subscribers, our viewers around the world to know about [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=260.48s)]
*  Malaysia that they don't know? In a world where there's so much deficit, trust deficit, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=264.96s)]
*  contradictions, hypocrisy, racism, religious fanaticism, Malaysia must be able to showcase [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=271.52s)]
*  their multiracial, multirigious country can make it through good governance, through tolerance, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=279.52s)]
*  and particularly with Muslim majority population. Can we showcase that Muslim majority can help [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=285.44s)]
*  manage a country with good governance and prepared economy? So it's interesting, you mentioned [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=293.12s)]
*  tolerance. We'll come back to religion and tolerance. Just in terms of political tolerance, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=298.56s)]
*  some people might say you're a little too tolerant towards the people who put you in prison. You're [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=302.56s)]
*  now in a coalition government with the BN, with the Barisan Nasional, who are partly behind your [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=307.52s)]
*  arrest, imprisonment on bogus charges. They're now in coalition with you. How do you explain [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=314.0s)]
*  that situation to people? We have to move on. It is a coalition, but the principles might be made [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=318.88s)]
*  clear. No tolerance of corruption, abuse of power, and focus on economic development. And I think [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=326.48s)]
*  that is the term. I can't go and talk about the years of torture and deprivation that Aziz Ahmad [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=335.28s)]
*  and my wife and children suffered, and many of the colleagues dismissed and detained without trial, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=344.23999999999995s)]
*  thousands of them through these years. But I think it's more important to do something effective for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=349.67999999999995s)]
*  the country and the people. In your own experience of having been a victim of abuse, of violation of human rights, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=356.64s)]
*  what has that made you think about human rights on your watch as Prime Minister? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=365.91999999999996s)]
*  You have a greater passion for freedom, for tolerance, for humanity. And I think, as I've said, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=369.44s)]
*  that what the world and particularly political elites lack is this passion for humanity, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=381.2s)]
*  for compassion. And there's too much contradictions in what they preach and what they practice. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=389.84s)]
*  On that note, you were designated as an amnesty prisoner of conscience when you were falsely [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=396.32s)]
*  imprisoned and tortured. I think, and I may be wrong here, I have a double-dub-triple checklist, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=401.52s)]
*  you may be the only former amnesty prisoner of conscience who is now a world leader in a position [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=405.68s)]
*  of power, as you say. You've won praise for getting rid of the mandatory death penalty here in Malaysia. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=411.04s)]
*  Human rights groups have praised you for that. But they've also criticized you as well. Amnesty [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=415.84s)]
*  International has said that your government has used, quote, repressive laws to silence critical [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=419.44s)]
*  voices and prevent peaceful protests. Human Rights Watch has said of your first year in power, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=425.12s)]
*  quote, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim betrayed the reform pledges he made to Malaysian voters so he [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  could hold his coalition together. What is your response to these human rights groups who once [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=434.88s)]
*  campaigned for your freedom? What evidence have they adduced? Amnesty International is a colleague. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=439.12s)]
*  I, of course, engaged with them in the past. But what is the issue? They say, for example, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=444.72s)]
*  your government has doubled the number of investigations under the Sedition Act last [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=454.08s)]
*  year, which was an act you said you would get rid of. Yeah, the sedition involves [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=458.0s)]
*  the sultans and the rulers in this country. The Constitution provides that protection. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=464.8s)]
*  They are not in politics. They are not supposed to respond. So we see you can criticize the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=471.2s)]
*  Prime Minister. They've called the Prime Minister anti-Christ and the Jew, Jewish agent, American [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  agent, Chinese agent, also our names. They have not been charged or investigated. But we have a [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=480.72s)]
*  limit. And they know the Constitution. They know the law. And they know the limits. What about your [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  political opponents? I live in the United States of America where Donald Trump is on the verge of [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=490.88000000000005s)]
*  returning to office. It's a bad example. It's a bad example. But the worry about Trump is he says, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to prosecute my opponents. I'm going to get revenge. And Bloomberg News the other week [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=499.36s)]
*  published a rather big piece on you. I don't know if you saw it. Yes. And they questioned whether [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=503.44000000000005s)]
*  you're guilty of, quote, perpetuating revenge politics, especially, they said, the opening of [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=507.12s)]
*  investigations into at least three of your former political opponents and their families, including [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=512.64s)]
*  ex-PM Mahathir. At the same time as you dropped an investigation into your deputy Prime Minister, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=517.28s)]
*  what's your response to Bloomberg? Now let's take this case. We have ex-leaders, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=522.72s)]
*  a messing worth by the billions. Do I then stop investigations? I did not instruct investigations. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=529.12s)]
*  But I get clear. Bloomberg claims you did. Well, they have no evidence to adduce that. We have taken [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=537.04s)]
*  a case against them because a very frivolous assertion. But as far as I'm concerned, if you [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=542.9599999999999s)]
*  use office to amass billions of dollars, I can close just because they happen to be in the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=552.0799999999999s)]
*  opposition or the government, regardless. How come you've given your deputy Prime Minister a [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=557.2s)]
*  pass then? I did not give him a pass. His name is Ahmad Zahid Hadeed. Yes, I did not give him a pass. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=561.5200000000001s)]
*  He was never convicted. Well, he wasn't convicted because the prosecutors decided to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=566.08s)]
*  just drop the case against him without much of an explanation. People took to the streets. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=570.8000000000001s)]
*  After you were with him. Your own supporters protesting. Yes, rightly so. And we tolerated them. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  But why drop the case? I did not drop the case. It's for the Attorney General to decide. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=580.24s)]
*  Isn't there any general? Yes, but it is an independent decision by the Attorney General. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=584.4s)]
*  And not only that, they have also dropped cases against the, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=590.48s)]
*  preferred against the opposition leaders. Why is that not an issue? But the more important thing [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=595.84s)]
*  is that the large scale corruption cases are still being investigated and charged. And it's [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  for the court to decide, not for me. Your Deputy Prime Minister was facing charges of corruption, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=607.52s)]
*  money laundering, breach of trust. You came to power very proudly saying you're going to [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=611.92s)]
*  stamp out corruption. Do you at least understand the perception that it looks odd that your Deputy [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=615.28s)]
*  Prime Minister gets off, but your political opponents get investigated? The issue of corruption is [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=620.7199999999999s)]
*  issue of law and facts, not perception. Perception does matter. But when you are in the position to [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=625.28s)]
*  execute and run the country, you don't run based on perceptions. Do you think you're winning the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=631.8399999999999s)]
*  battle against corruption? Yes. What evidence do you have? Well, you have seen that because [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=637.68s)]
*  the decisions that we have made, number one, we have the Financial Responsibility Act, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=643.1999999999999s)]
*  we have, which means accountability to the parliament. We have taken serious actions against [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=648.64s)]
*  many leaders or corporate leaders. We have been known to be amassing wealth for the last few [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=654.88s)]
*  decades. And there is no more negotiated tenders, which is a route to squander public funds. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=661.36s)]
*  All tender process are transparent. And I think this is a very good start. Have we been [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=671.84s)]
*  really successful in wiping out corruption? No. I have said that corruption is systemic. It takes [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=678.4s)]
*  time, daily, almost every other day, without exception. You have seen the Anti-Corruption [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=684.32s)]
*  Commission going after immigration or customs. And that commission, just to clarify before we move on, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  you don't have anything to do with it. You don't give them their marching orders? You haven't called [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=695.36s)]
*  them up and say, go after this person? I did give my general marching orders. Do not condone corruption. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=698.32s)]
*  Move aggressively. You have been, let's talk about Gaza, a big issue globally for a lot of our viewers, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=704.32s)]
*  for a lot of people around the world. You have been quite outspoken about Israel's assault on [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=710.8s)]
*  Gaza, even calling it a genocide, a word that many Western leaders avoid saying at all costs. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=714.64s)]
*  What has it been like for you personally, as a Prime Minister of Malaysia, as a Muslim, as a father, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=719.5999999999999s)]
*  to see what we have seen unfolding on our TV screens, on our phones for the past year? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=728.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, I've followed this case for the last many, many decades. I've been [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=734.0799999999999s)]
*  arrested when I was a student leader supporting the Palestinian cause, the release of Arafat. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=738.16s)]
*  I've attended the PLO session. I think he called you a son of Palestine. Yes, yes, in 1983 or much earlier. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  So it's not new. But the sheer hypocrisy of many of the countries in the West to condone this, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=752.64s)]
*  to me, is shocking, is appalling. And therefore, we have to speak up. I mean, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  Malaysia is a small country, but I think it is a voice of conscience and represents the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=765.6s)]
*  vast majority of Malaysians. I think you represent the vast majority of a lot of people around the [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=771.0400000000001s)]
*  world. You mentioned hypocrisy on this issue. In May, when you were asked if the US is complicit [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=775.6s)]
*  in the war crimes Israel is committing, you said that you are, quote, in no position to deny that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=781.9200000000001s)]
*  Does that mean that in your view, President Joe Biden of the United States, who has been driving [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=787.6800000000001s)]
*  much of that support for Israel, giving aid, giving bombs in an almost unconditional way, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=792.0s)]
*  is he complicit in those war crimes? Is he complicit in the genocide that you have identified? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=797.28s)]
*  Complicity in the genocide per se is, of course, a strictly legal question. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=801.36s)]
*  Morally? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=806.64s)]
*  In certain, there's, of course, I've said that, moral abandonment, which means you condemn, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=808.0s)]
*  you say cease fire, at the same time, you've been sending weapons. So there's clearly, to me, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=814.4s)]
*  hypocrisy. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=822.08s)]
*  From Joe Biden? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=822.88s)]
*  From United States administration. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=824.16s)]
*  The US, obviously, is a crucial player in this. Israel is becoming a bit of a pariah in the world, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=827.36s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, with the law cases, with countries now trying to bring in sanctions, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=833.12s)]
*  you know, Colombia, other countries. Malaysia has said that you won't allow any Israeli ships [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=838.16s)]
*  to dock in your ports. Some people would say, why not extend that to US ships? Why not take a stand [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=844.56s)]
*  against the US? Because Israel can't do anything without US support. Is that on the horizon? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=849.68s)]
*  Be realistic. Then you have to go against hundreds, probably, of other countries. I think we do [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=853.28s)]
*  confine ourselves to the issue of Palestine and the perpetrator, direct perpetration by Israel. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=860.0s)]
*  And it's interesting when you mention ship, because it was condoned in the past by all [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  earlier prime ministers in the name of the Islamic Party, Malay Party. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=873.68s)]
*  Despite Malaysia having no relation with Israel? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=877.12s)]
*  Again, some part of the hypocrisy in this country, and which you need to be exposed, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  and that's why we took a tough decision to stop that. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=884.0799999999999s)]
*  In March, during a visit to Berlin in front of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, you fiercely [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  criticized Europe's position on the conflict, on the genocide. You pointed out, you know, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=892.16s)]
*  that they are only concerned about one particular incident and one victim, namely Israel, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=896.88s)]
*  and forgetting the suffering of the Palestinians. Those remarks of yours went viral online. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=900.8s)]
*  Tell me, what were you thinking in that moment? You're sitting in Germany, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=905.84s)]
*  a country where the Holocaust happened, a government which is very pro-Israel. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=910.08s)]
*  You represent an Asian country, a middle-income country. What were you thinking there when you [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=913.4399999999999s)]
*  made those remarks? Because the Chancellor looked pretty uncomfortable sitting next to you. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=918.0s)]
*  But Chancellor Olaf Scholz is a good friend, and a very frank exchange with him. He was very candid. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=921.04s)]
*  I took a lot of pain in trying to explain to him. He understands that, fair, but then [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=927.52s)]
*  there was a very provocative question. I don't know anything about provocative questions. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=934.88s)]
*  So I have no choice. I have to say the truth. And I think, well, to be fair to Olaf Scholz, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=941.4399999999999s)]
*  he was exceedingly kind and polite, and we went on for another two hours after that of intensive [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=950.88s)]
*  discussions. Do you think it's interesting that what you said that day probably represents the [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=957.68s)]
*  views of more Europeans than European leaders do? I believe it represents many Europeans, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=961.76s)]
*  but certainly the younger ones. The students, the youth, the appeal. I mean, they have been demanding [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=969.28s)]
*  for justice, and they have expressed their horror and anger for this despicable act to continue. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=977.12s)]
*  This past May, the ICC Chief Prosecutor requested a series of arrest warrants, including for Israeli [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=985.6s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as his defence minister, Yov Galan. Do you support [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=990.24s)]
*  arrest warrants for those two men, and do you believe Western countries should execute those [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=994.72s)]
*  warrants if they are handed down by the court? Once the court decides if they are members of the [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=999.04s)]
*  ICC, which many of the European countries in that they are not members, it's also an issue. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1005.12s)]
*  Why isn't Malaysia a member, by the way? Well, there are issues because of the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1011.92s)]
*  the conditions imposed, and I think we had some issues earlier then, but we are reviewing that now. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1015.76s)]
*  But you in principle support the idea of Netanyahu being held to account for war crimes? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1025.6s)]
*  We are in principle support of any possible measure by the international community to stop this [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1030.24s)]
*  madness. So it's interesting because the ICC Chief Prosecutor asked for five arrest warrants, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1041.12s)]
*  two for Netanyahu and Galan, three for leaders of Hamas, including Ismail Haniyeh, who was [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1045.6s)]
*  killed in Tehran not long ago. Do you support holding Hamas to account as well? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1050.7199999999998s)]
*  Well, you don't prosecute the victim. That's my position. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1057.36s)]
*  Is Hamas only a victim? Hamas can't actually carry out atrocities? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  No, but they were victims. Maybe you're... [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1067.28s)]
*  Palestinians are victims, but is Hamas... [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1069.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but they have been colonized. They have been elected as leaders to represent their people. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1071.2s)]
*  I don't necessarily share their views on many issues, but I think I do understand the plight [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1080.32s)]
*  of these people. If one part of my country is being colonized, I wouldn't stop at anything just to [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1086.24s)]
*  make sure they have freedom. But you can be pro-Palestinian without being pro-Hamas. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1092.96s)]
*  Of course I am pro-Palestinian. Yeah, but you can be pro-Palestinian without being pro-Hamas. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  Sure, but it's up to the Palestinians to decide whom they want. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1100.24s)]
*  Agreed, but you're the Prime Minister of Malaysia. You can decide who you want to support. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1103.6s)]
*  I support Palestinian cause. Well, you met with Ismail Haniyeh in May [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1106.6399999999999s)]
*  before he was killed and faced a lot of criticism for it, which you responded to after he was killed, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1109.92s)]
*  saying that those critics of yours, quote, failed to appreciate his deep desire for a peaceful [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1115.04s)]
*  Middle East. A lot of people would say, Prime Minister, that's an outrageous thing to say about [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  a man who praised October the 7th, praised the killing of Israeli civilians, even praised [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1124.8799999999999s)]
*  Osama bin Laden when he died. Mehdi, view and look with some empathy [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1129.04s)]
*  the cause of those who have been colonized. That's Palestinians again. I'm asking about Hamas. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1138.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I'm talking about Hamas represents the Palestinians. Not all Palestinians are [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1143.84s)]
*  portion of Palestinians, but they are Palestinians regardless. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1148.24s)]
*  That's an excuse for war crimes. They're certainly who represents Israelis, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1151.28s)]
*  but he's still committing war crimes. Why did you call Mandela and committed? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1153.84s)]
*  I didn't call him anything. No, for example. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1160.9599999999998s)]
*  Why did the US call him a terrorist? Yes, the same, the same issue. You don't call [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1162.3999999999999s)]
*  victims and the colonized in their decision to fight the colonial masters as terrorists. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  Some people think that some of your rhetoric about Hamas since October the 7th [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  is driven by domestic politics in Malaysia. That you have the PASS party, an Islamic party, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1181.2s)]
*  which is the single biggest party in your parliament right now, not part of your coalition, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1186.3200000000002s)]
*  but that you have this challenge from the kind of quote unquote Islamic right. I don't know if [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1190.16s)]
*  that's the right phrase. And that's why you're making all these statements about Hamas because [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1194.64s)]
*  you want to kind of pacify your conservative Muslim constituency. What do you say to people? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1198.0800000000002s)]
*  In the, I've been in touch with all these groups, whether I agree or disagree for the last [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1203.2s)]
*  four or five decades, long before Hamas was formed. And so I don't see why I need to be [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1210.8000000000002s)]
*  dictated by the terms here. I have known Haniya for the last few decades. What do you believe [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1219.52s)]
*  is the resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict? To stop this aggression. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1226.3200000000002s)]
*  Agreed, that's short term. But what do you think the political solution of Hamas? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1230.72s)]
*  Once you stop that and withdraw. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1234.08s)]
*  So it's a classic two-state solution. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1237.28s)]
*  Yes, yes. Which of course is not easy, but then what else do you have there? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1238.96s)]
*  The US has to make it happen, right? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1243.92s)]
*  It is essentially the US decision. They can make it happen, but it is a known fact that it will be [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1245.44s)]
*  extremely difficult to persuade them to see the facts and the truth. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1252.64s)]
*  In August, the Wall Street Journal published an article about your country with the headline [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1259.44s)]
*  being, Anger over US's Gaza Policy Opens Door Wider for China. And a lot of American think tanks [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  like the Wilson Center in DC are saying that China is exploiting the Gaza issue to get closer [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1268.48s)]
*  to a lot of Muslim majority countries. Do you think that's true? And do you feel Malaysia's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1273.28s)]
*  relationship with China has grown stronger since October the 7th? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1277.84s)]
*  Long before October 7th, we have had excellent or sure say good bilateral relation. But when [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1282.1599999999999s)]
*  I assume office, I have decided that look, we have to work with our neighbors. ASEAN is a priority. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1289.0400000000002s)]
*  We have India, we have China, we have Australia. We have given the clear foreign policy. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1294.4s)]
*  But you've praised China's stance on Gaza while you've criticized the US, right? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1300.72s)]
*  Yeah, because they've taken a position that's quite similar to ours. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1304.24s)]
*  Do you believe that China gives a damn about the people of Palestine? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1307.8400000000001s)]
*  Even what they're doing to Muslims in Xinjiang. You know about the Uighur situation. Can a country [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1311.44s)]
*  its own Muslim so badly really give a damn about it? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1316.96s)]
*  I don't think it's fair to compare these two situations where you have complete genocide [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1319.2s)]
*  and open killings on a daily basis with the issue of Uighur. And with Uighur, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1330.08s)]
*  unlike the Israeli position. Many people believe what's happening in Xinjiang with the Uighurs [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1337.2s)]
*  is also a genocide. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1342.4s)]
*  Well, I dispute that. But notwithstanding that there are differences, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1343.92s)]
*  issues with the people of Uighur, there are avenues. Unlike Israel, which has refused to have [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1350.5600000000002s)]
*  any discussion. So has China. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1357.76s)]
*  No. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1359.44s)]
*  Well, in private, I do discuss. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1363.2800000000002s)]
*  Do you condemn what's happening to the Uighurs? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1364.96s)]
*  I discuss, I ask questions and I... [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1366.48s)]
*  You condemn it. You're condemning Israel. So I'm just asking... [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1368.48s)]
*  Well, if I'm convinced that there is evidence not necessarily from western propaganda. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  It's from groups like Amnesty that supported you. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1378.72s)]
*  Yes, yes. That's why I raised the issue. Precisely because of that I raised the issue. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1380.8s)]
*  What answer did you get back? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1385.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, they said... [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1386.48s)]
*  They're going to deny it obviously. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1387.04s)]
*  Of course they deny. But what's more important, Mehdi, is that they do take this into consideration. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1388.72s)]
*  You see, it's not bad denial. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1395.44s)]
*  I interviewed Imran Khan when... and he... this is prior to him going to prison obviously. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1398.0s)]
*  And he refused to say anything critical of China either. There's a lot... there's a view that says [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1404.16s)]
*  a lot of Muslim leaders are happy to criticize America, Israel, Europe, but they won't criticize [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1408.8s)]
*  China because they rely too much on China. Is that fair? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1413.76s)]
*  It is not fair because this attempt like, you know, equating Ukraine with Gaza, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1416.8s)]
*  or equating Uighur issue with Gaza. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1422.48s)]
*  Well, let's talk about Ukraine. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1424.72s)]
*  No, it's completely to me unfounded because it is grossly unfair. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1426.4s)]
*  Okay, so forget Gaza for a moment. Just Ukraine. You mentioned Ukraine. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1431.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1434.16s)]
*  Do you condemn Vladimir Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine and his annexation? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1434.56s)]
*  I have in my Yunga speech, I've condemned the American invasion of... I'm sorry, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1438.88s)]
*  Russian invasion of Ukraine. But it's a different situation. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1445.92s)]
*  But partly because Putin is prepared to enter into a negotiation. I've said it in Vladivostok [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1452.48s)]
*  in front of Putin. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1459.52s)]
*  You also praised Putin as well there. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1460.56s)]
*  I praised him for other issues, for Global South, for BRICS. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1462.4s)]
*  So again, the cynic would say, and I'd love to hear your response to this, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1466.8s)]
*  that Malaysia right now is trying to join the BRICS, right, which is of course [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1469.6s)]
*  economic coalition of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1472.72s)]
*  And do you feel that Malaysia's economic interests, you're a middle-income country, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1476.16s)]
*  you're not a superpower, you have aspirations, and we'll talk about that. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1479.6s)]
*  But do you believe that that need to be part of BRICS means [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1483.36s)]
*  you would like to say more about China or Russia, but you can't? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1487.36s)]
*  Not necessarily. I've said it publicly about the invasion of Ukraine. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1490.56s)]
*  I've discussed with Chinese leaders and they have been quite prepared to at least listen [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1496.24s)]
*  and give their avenue. I have praised America on a number of issues. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1501.76s)]
*  So you're playing on balancing actually? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1506.08s)]
*  Not balance, what I consider is right and what is important for the country. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1507.84s)]
*  Fair play. During a recent meeting with Putin on Ukraine, you talked about the quote, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1511.6s)]
*  enormous potential for enhancing trade relations with Russia. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1515.6799999999998s)]
*  And unfortunately, when I see that, I can't help but think of former Pakistani Prime Minister [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1519.4399999999998s)]
*  Imran Khan, who in 2022 was removed from office in a coup that a lot of people believe the US [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1522.8799999999999s)]
*  was involved in and was driven by what they thought was his closeness with Russia. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1528.48s)]
*  Do you worry about your own seat of power here going up against the US? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1534.08s)]
*  Do you have discussions in Malaysia about what might the US do to me if I get too close to Russia [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1538.6399999999999s)]
*  or China? The intelligence agencies are more worried. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1542.8s)]
*  Yours? Yes. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1545.68s)]
*  Fair. And I listen, but I think the other is- [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1547.2s)]
*  They're worried about the US? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1549.28s)]
*  No, they're worried because they understand the new politics, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1550.56s)]
*  they understand what's happening, what has been happening in Africa and many other countries. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1553.52s)]
*  They see you in that tightrope. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1557.76s)]
*  But I assured them, look, we should continue to maintain good relations with the United States. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1558.8s)]
*  I mean, largest foreign investments are still from the United States, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1564.48s)]
*  cumulatively from the United States. They have a lot of interest here. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1568.24s)]
*  Now, we have not, I mean, to be fair, we have not seen any sign of the United States meddling [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1572.24s)]
*  into internal politics. That's what I was about to ask. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1579.6s)]
*  Have they not spoken to you? No one for the administration has reached out to you or your [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1581.44s)]
*  people to say, what is UNWAR saying about Putin or China or Hamas? We've not heard any feedback. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1585.04s)]
*  Also, regarding China, and of course, I'm concerned about my visit to Vladivostok. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1592.72s)]
*  But we did explain China is an important neighbor, is the largest trading partner now. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1599.2s)]
*  And we don't have issues. Why you talk about South China? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1604.32s)]
*  You do have issues. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1608.8s)]
*  South China says, we have issues with all our neighbors. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1609.2s)]
*  But why single out- China is the aggressive one on the South China Sea. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1611.6s)]
*  No, why single out China? That's why I said this is the discourse of the West. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1613.44s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. That's not the discourse of the West. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1618.72s)]
*  It's the discourse of the West. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1620.48s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. Japan, the Philippines, multiple neighbors have called out China. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1621.44s)]
*  We have issues, neighbor issues, boundary issues with China and the Philippines, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1624.88s)]
*  Indonesia and Singapore and Brunei and Thailand. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1631.1200000000001s)]
*  You do? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1634.3200000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1634.96s)]
*  But all I'm saying is a lot of Asian countries- [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1635.28s)]
*  But we don't go to war with these countries. We engage with them, we discuss with them. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1636.48s)]
*  So it's with China. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1640.64s)]
*  What's the solution with China, by the way? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1641.28s)]
*  Bilateral, multilateral, ASEAN, we could negotiate. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1643.6000000000001s)]
*  These economic partnerships with Russia and China, they are growing. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1648.16s)]
*  Malaysia potentially could join BRICS. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1650.8000000000002s)]
*  Your countries saw a GDP increase of nearly 6% in the second quarter of this year, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1652.8000000000002s)]
*  way surpassing initial estimates. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1657.2800000000002s)]
*  I believe the economy is set to expand up to 5% overall this year. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1659.1200000000001s)]
*  Is the economy doing better than it did at the start of your premiership? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1662.8000000000002s)]
*  And what is the cause of that? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1666.24s)]
*  Well, I would say there's also international and [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1668.32s)]
*  the regional atmosphere, which is conducive, but more so is the issue of governance, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1674.1599999999999s)]
*  is transparency, clarity of policies and effective execution policies, ease of doing business. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1679.12s)]
*  And I think that has probably changed the perception of those countries, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1688.56s)]
*  because in the past there have always been totally corrupt countries, one MDB, nothing else. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1694.64s)]
*  We say, look, we do not condone that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1699.76s)]
*  In fact, the crusade against corruption is tough. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1702.48s)]
*  We talked about the Chinese leadership, we talked about Putin, we talked about Netanyahu. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1705.68s)]
*  Let's talk about some other controversial leaders, particularly in the US. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1709.68s)]
*  Former President Donald Trump is running for re-election. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1712.96s)]
*  I know you spoke to him, I believe, recently after the attempted assassination attempt? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1715.84s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1719.52s)]
*  Well, you sent your regards, I believe, publicly to check if you were okay. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1720.16s)]
*  He says that if he wins, he's going to bring back an even bigger Muslim ban. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1724.16s)]
*  How worried are you about that, as well as his brazen, blatant Islamophobia? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1729.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, we have to deal with it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1736.24s)]
*  I strongly object to that. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1738.64s)]
*  We will certainly express our views, but the days of racism, of religious bigotry, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1740.88s)]
*  of Islamophobia must end. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1747.76s)]
*  And I think even smaller countries will continue to express. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1752.0s)]
*  Hopefully, he will adjust and change with power. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1756.64s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1761.04s)]
*  I don't think that's the case. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1761.6s)]
*  Well, I agree with you, I agree with you. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1762.48s)]
*  But there's no evidence that he's about to change his views. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1764.56s)]
*  He may be worse than before. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1767.04s)]
*  There are a lot of Muslims, Prime Minister, you know this, living in the West, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1768.64s)]
*  in Europe, in the United States, North America, who are feeling very uncertain about the world [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1771.92s)]
*  right now and their place in the West as Western Muslims, having been born and brought up there. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1776.08s)]
*  I include myself here. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1781.28s)]
*  There's talk of Plan Bs. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1782.8s)]
*  What do we do? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1784.1599999999999s)]
*  Where do we go if we're not welcome here? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1784.6399999999999s)]
*  You've had Islamophobic race rights in the UK over the summer. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1786.48s)]
*  Donald Trump on the cusp of returning to power with a Muslim ban. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1790.56s)]
*  A lot of people know you as a politician, as an opposition leader, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1794.24s)]
*  but you've also been a scholar of Islam. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1796.96s)]
*  You've taught at Georgetown in D.C., at Oxford University in the UK. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1799.6799999999998s)]
*  What is your message to a lot of Western Muslims watching this right now saying, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1803.6s)]
*  what is our place? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1809.6s)]
*  Where do we fit in? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1810.56s)]
*  Do you have a view on that? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1811.52s)]
*  I did participate in one of the sessions European Muslims held, I think, in Istanbul some years back, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1813.52s)]
*  when they have to make the decision. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1820.32s)]
*  But of course, they have to express their views. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1821.76s)]
*  They are Germans or French or Americans. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1825.76s)]
*  They should not regard themselves as Muslim ghettoes, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1829.68s)]
*  and therefore they should be able to interact with the community. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1834.72s)]
*  But I do empathize with them, their predicament, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1840.3200000000002s)]
*  and I think it is the role of not only Muslim countries, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1846.24s)]
*  but then countries all over the world to just express their disgust [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1849.3600000000001s)]
*  and protest against any sort of unfair treatment of minorities all over. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  We are concerned about our minorities here, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1863.04s)]
*  and I think on such a moral high ground we continue to express our views. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1866.64s)]
*  So talking about here, a lot of the Islamophobia in the West, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1872.32s)]
*  many Islamophobes would argue, well, we don't like Islam because look at the state of Muslim countries. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1876.32s)]
*  Look at the state of the Islamic world. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  In the West, when you say Muslim country, you think Afghanistan and the treatment of women, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1882.72s)]
*  Iran and the treatment of women, Saudi Arabia and the treatment of all sorts of minorities. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1886.8s)]
*  People don't automatically think of Malaysia, which is a Muslim majority country and a democracy. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  What is it like being the Muslim Prime Minister of a Muslim majority country [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1895.68s)]
*  that also sees itself as a democracy with free and fair elections? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1899.52s)]
*  That is a problem because the discourse there is cute to a certain particular view. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1904.24s)]
*  To them, Afghanistan represents the Muslim world. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1910.64s)]
*  We've been trying to tell them it is a major challenge. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1914.88s)]
*  Islamophobia is a reality. It is real. It's happening. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1918.96s)]
*  You can see such blatant prejudices from Burlusconi in the past [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1922.24s)]
*  to many of the rhetorics in the United States these days, but we'll continue. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1926.64s)]
*  For example, you mentioned our minorities here. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1934.64s)]
*  In a country where I think one third of the country is not Muslim, is Hindu, Buddhist, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1937.04s)]
*  but is still a Muslim majority country, Islam is mentioned in the Constitution. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1943.12s)]
*  What is the relationship then between those non-Muslim minorities and the Muslim majority? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1946.32s)]
*  They have equal rights as citizens and some of the issues they raised. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1952.1599999999999s)]
*  I had a meeting, for example, with the mainly Indian Hindu leaders recently, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1957.12s)]
*  expressing their concern about some issues, about access to education, but we allow them. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1962.24s)]
*  We're here and we try to resolve most of these issues. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1969.04s)]
*  What do you say to Malaysian Muslims, including Malaysian political parties, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1972.8s)]
*  who say they want to bring in hudud punishments, the stonings, the beatings, the lashings? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1977.84s)]
*  What is the future of that in Malaysia? [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1981.92s)]
*  They have not got the priorities right. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1984.08s)]
*  Certainly, our priorities are peace and security, economic development. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1988.4s)]
*  They know that. They have said that, but they will use this at the right time, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1995.2s)]
*  particularly closer to the elections. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=1998.64s)]
*  When they are all in power, they say, no, hudud is not our priority now. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2001.04s)]
*  Are they using it cynically as a stick to beat you? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2006.64s)]
*  Yeah, it is more political, because otherwise in Islam too, you have this [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2008.72s)]
*  I should say issue of priorities. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2013.3600000000001s)]
*  To me, the priority is peace and security. It's a multiracial country. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2016.16s)]
*  Do you believe there is a place in Islam in 2024 for these kind of punishments? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2019.5200000000002s)]
*  Certainly not, because we are not in the position to execute them. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2023.8400000000001s)]
*  We will have to build a consensus if that's what the vast majority want. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2030.16s)]
*  Not likely for now. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2035.1200000000001s)]
*  Of course, the religious begots will go after me, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2038.0800000000002s)]
*  after listening to the Mehdi interview, about talking about hudud. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2040.8s)]
*  But I'm a Muslim. I'm a practicing Muslim. I make no apologies about it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2045.28s)]
*  But I think there are priorities. We have to survive. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2049.12s)]
*  We have to make sure that it's peace and security. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2052.32s)]
*  We have to make sure we deal with the better issues. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2054.24s)]
*  Focus on the right. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2057.04s)]
*  Yeah, and more so with these days of post-normal times and digitalization, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2057.68s)]
*  energy transition, then we shouldn't then come up and deal with these issues. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2063.52s)]
*  These are priorities. Better education, quality education, better health services. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2068.72s)]
*  And not to be talking about issues that they themselves know they are not going to execute. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2073.12s)]
*  Well, let me get you one more question to get you in a bit more trouble with the religious begots. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2078.0s)]
*  When I spoke to you back in 2018, you criticized Malaysia's anti-LGBTQ laws, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2081.68s)]
*  the same laws which led to your own imprisonment on bogus charges. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2087.6s)]
*  You called them, quote, archaic, and you said they were a legacy of British colonialism, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2091.04s)]
*  not of Islam. You told me that those laws, quote, have to be revised and amended. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2095.28s)]
*  But since becoming Prime Minister, you haven't done that. Why? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2101.36s)]
*  There are many other priorities. I want first security of this country. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2103.84s)]
*  I want to build this consensus. I want the focus in the fundamentalist economy, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2106.96s)]
*  is quality education. That's not my priority. That's the priority in Europe. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2111.36s)]
*  If it's not your priority, why did the government literally raid swatch stores last year and seize [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2116.7200000000003s)]
*  Rainbow Pride watches? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2120.8s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2122.1600000000003s)]
*  You disagree with what? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2123.6000000000004s)]
*  I disagree with the action. We have told them. There's no other. I mean, it's a decision taken [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2124.56s)]
*  by the particular department, and I think they are overreacting. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2130.0s)]
*  You've talked a lot about how when you were in prison, you spent a lot of time studying [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2135.36s)]
*  Shakespeare's works. I was reading this recently, and you told Time magazine recently [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2139.04s)]
*  that your favorite of those works, at least when it comes to politics, is King Lear. Why? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2142.56s)]
*  No, I think towards the end. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2147.68s)]
*  Which is? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2150.56s)]
*  Dialogue with the Cordelia. The sadness about this theater and looking at the players and [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2151.36s)]
*  being a bit cynical about the whole theatrics of political elites. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2158.7200000000003s)]
*  You also used to sing in prison, I believe, together. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2167.52s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2170.0s)]
*  What songs did you sing, and can you give us a brief rendition? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2171.2000000000003s)]
*  You see, in prison, one of my favorite numbers is Release Me. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2174.6400000000003s)]
*  But outside, I can't, because the lyrics you see that my wife would take strong objection. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2178.48s)]
*  But in prison, the context was Release Me, so that I can get out of prison. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2183.6000000000004s)]
*  You've always been a hopeful person, I think it's fair to say. You got through prison by keeping [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2193.44s)]
*  hope alive. Your ruling coalition's name in English is Alliance of Hope. How do you keep [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2197.52s)]
*  hope alive today in a world that is on fire? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2203.04s)]
*  Yeah. For Malaysians, I have consistently said that I believe in the wisdom of the masses, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2205.92s)]
*  that general people have that passion for freedom, for goodness, for humane ethics and ethics. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2216.2400000000002s)]
*  And I've seen that working. Yes, in the first few months, it was horrible, terrible for us. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2226.64s)]
*  There were a lot of cynicism, a lot of concern about re-shifting and leaving Islam or leaving [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2234.32s)]
*  the Malay issues. But I think given some time, they've seen us to be really consistent. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2241.04s)]
*  But the challenge for any political elite is to honor their condolence, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2246.0800000000004s)]
*  to execute policies consistent with what they have pronounced in the past. And that's a major [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2252.0800000000004s)]
*  challenge. And I think if we can deliver that, I would say, inshallah, we can then showcase Malaysia. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2257.76s)]
*  That's important. We are not in the position to solve all the problems of the world. We will [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2266.2400000000002s)]
*  continue to engage and express our position boldly, but at the same time, the battle is the home ground. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2270.88s)]
*  Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2280.7200000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2283.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJPfkRGSUI&t=2287.76s)]
