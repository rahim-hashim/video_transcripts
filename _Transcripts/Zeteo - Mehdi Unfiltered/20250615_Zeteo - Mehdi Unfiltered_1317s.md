Video Description: “I think we have to stop doing this thing where we pretend that there's still goodness or something worth protecting over on the Republican side of the aisle. I think that we are so busy thinking and living in this nostalgia for a bipartisanship, for a civility that just does not exist anymore.”
Mehdi Hasan sits down with Pennsylvania congresswoman, Summer Lee and discusses the downfall of Democratic Party leadership, policies on the Middle East and Democratic inaction. She also dives in Gaza, Trump and the South African refugee program, while calling her party to “wake up.”

# Democrats Need to STOP PRETENDING Everything is Under Control
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI)
*  As President Donald Trump and Republicans continue to play chicken with tariffs and threaten cuts to Medicaid, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=0.0s)]
*  economic anxiety in the US is surging with new polling showing that 6 in 10 Americans are now putting off major life goals, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=5.4s)]
*  like having kids, getting married or buying a house. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  And yet with even all of Trump's reckless actions, Democrats are still polling 8 points behind Republicans [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  when it comes to the issue of the economy, reminding us just how much that party, the Democratic Party, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=19.6s)]
*  has failed to rebuild itself after the devastating losses in November. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=24.2s)]
*  This comes as Democrats have hit record low approval ratings this past spring at just 27%, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  with some voters describing the party as a quote, deer in the headlights. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=33.9s)]
*  To make matters worse, there are questions as to whether House Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Leader Chuck Schumer [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=37.5s)]
*  are the right people to be leading the Democratic Party right now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=42.5s)]
*  Over the weekend, Jeffries showed off his spinelessness to CNN's Dana Bash as he delivered a vague and jumbled word salad [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  on how Democrats planned to respond after the Trump administration handcuffed and briefly detained [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=52.0s)]
*  Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler's staffer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=57.1s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=59.4s)]
*  We will make that decision in a time, place and manner of our choosing, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=60.1s)]
*  but the response will be continuous and it will meet the moment that is required. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=65.2s)]
*  What exactly does that mean? Have you not decided how to respond? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=72.6s)]
*  We've publicly responded in a variety of different ways. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=79.0s)]
*  We haven't let our foot off the gas pedal in terms of additional things that may take place [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=81.9s)]
*  with respect to our congressional oversight authority and capacity. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=87.2s)]
*  We will respond in a time, place and manner of our choosing if this continues to happen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  Ooh, very intimidating. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=100.4s)]
*  A party says that they will respond in various ways eventually at some point. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=102.5s)]
*  Of course, Chuck Schumer is no better as he started off his week trying to be even more right-wing than Trump [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=106.5s)]
*  on Iran, telling the president that he needs to be even more hawkish towards the Iranian government, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=111.1s)]
*  even as President Trump has threatened to bomb the country if they don't agree to a new nuclear deal. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  As much as Schumer and others are trying to move the party to the right to fight fascism [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=119.8s)]
*  with the hopeless strategy of decency and decorum, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  there are still some Democrats who aren't afraid to take Trump head-on with bold and progressive policy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  That includes Pennsylvania Congresswoman and Squad Member Summer Lee, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=132.1s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=135.5s)]
*  Congressman, thanks for coming back on the show. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=136.4s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=137.9s)]
*  Over three-quarters of Americans disapprove of Medicaid cuts, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=139.6s)]
*  and yet even with Trump pushing such an unpopular policy, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=143.79999999999998s)]
*  Democrats are still polling eight points behind Republicans when it comes to the economy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=147.7s)]
*  Why are they losing on an issue that they should be winning by a mile on? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=152.4s)]
*  Isn't this the time to show the choice? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=156.1s)]
*  You know, I am—that's a really good point, and I think that what we are all trying to cut through, right, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=158.7s)]
*  is why are Democrats performing so poorly, right? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=164.9s)]
*  Even when we have a clear advantage on an issue that a majority of Americans think— [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=168.0s)]
*  and I think that we are still just not getting into the roots of what Americans' concerns are for the Democratic Party, right? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=172.4s)]
*  Like the authenticity. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=179.6s)]
*  While we're obviously fighting very rightfully on the plane of Medicaid, Social Security, snap benefits, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=180.8s)]
*  cuts to all of those things, in this big deficit bill, we're also marred by scandal about the gerontocracy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=186.3s)]
*  We're still fighting and punching love. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=192.2s)]
*  We still have, you know, leaders, you know, vague leaders, you know, little Elb in the party, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=194.1s)]
*  really out loud talking about whether or not we should entertain progressives, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=200.8s)]
*  whether or not we should expand the electorate, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=204.6s)]
*  So we're doing all of those at the same time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=206.3s)]
*  And it's like—it is turning people off because we still haven't really met them where they are. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=208.1s)]
*  And I think that the Democratic Party is still hoping that people will come to us and that that will have to go to them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=214.7s)]
*  Congressman, last week, I don't know if you saw, The New York Times cited a focus group [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=220.1s)]
*  where people were asked what kind of animal they would compare the Democratic Party to. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  And one Democratic voter from Georgia called your party, quote, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=227.5s)]
*  deer, a deer in the headlights, saying that Democrats stand there and see the car coming, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=230.7s)]
*  but they stand there and get hit anyway. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=235.2s)]
*  Do you agree with that vote? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=238.0s)]
*  Is that how Democrats have handled Trump when you got this overwhelming shitstorm, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=238.9s)]
*  for want of a better word, coming your way, and you just take it? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=244.1s)]
*  So I don't disagree. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=247.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=249.1s)]
*  No, I don't disagree, right? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=249.5s)]
*  Because I do think that, first of all, the Democratic Party is not just one monolithic thing, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=250.6s)]
*  We know that the same way we know about everything else. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=255.9s)]
*  So yeah, I definitely think there are some Democrats who probably are way more deer in the headlights than they are anything else. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=258.2s)]
*  And then I also think that we're all in real time dealing with the very real crisis that we have in front of us, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=263.1s)]
*  where it feels like we don't have as many weapons. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=269.3s)]
*  But it's our responsibility to figure out how to communicate effectively, how to organize. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=271.3s)]
*  If we don't have the power to do something, then it's our job to go on the outside and bring in the power, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=275.4s)]
*  bring in people, help to connect people to the issue. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=281.7s)]
*  I don't think we're doing that well enough. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=284.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't think we've ever done it well enough. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=287.2s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  Even your former vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Governor Till Wols, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=289.0s)]
*  he used a road analogy as well, saying the party's at risk of becoming, quote, roadkill. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  And it's time for your party to be meaner to Trump, saying, quote, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  When it's a bully like Donald Trump, you bully the shit out of him. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you think that's what your party leadership is doing? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=305.6s)]
*  Do you think you're aggressive enough? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=307.5s)]
*  Listen, I think that we're aggressive on all the wrong fronts. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=328.5s)]
*  I think that this party is really... [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=329.0s)]
*  I say this all the time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=330.8s)]
*  We're going to have to decide what master we want to serve. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=331.7s)]
*  At the end of the day, Donald Trump will come and go. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=334.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  Now, the movement that he's created... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=336.8s)]
*  We hope he will. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=338.3s)]
*  He will. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=340.0s)]
*  He will, as all people do. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=340.6s)]
*  The movement will probably still be there because I don't think that we are addressing the root of it. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=342.1s)]
*  But while we're, you know, trying to do this balance, right? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=345.90000000000003s)]
*  We want to be the party of the people on one hand, but then we also still want to answer to our own corporate billionaires. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=349.2s)]
*  We want to keep our own donors in line. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=354.0s)]
*  And I think that the people of America are sick of that because they're recognizing that we're talking out of both sides. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=356.5s)]
*  Both sides of our mouth. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=360.7s)]
*  How are we going to address the issues facing working class Americans? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=362.2s)]
*  But we're sitting up in corporate boardrooms all day. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=367.0s)]
*  Or we're at, you know, country clubs. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=368.9s)]
*  You know, we're taking our orders from people who are so disconnected from what the average American is facing. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=370.8s)]
*  Like, people see that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=375.9s)]
*  They feel that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  And even as we're, you know, talking and we're looking at our democracy, failing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=378.7s)]
*  We're looking at our democracy actively failing. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=383.5s)]
*  And yet, what are we doing and saying about money and politics? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=385.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=388.3s)]
*  What are we doing and saying about like the corporate overreach, the donor class? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=388.70000000000005s)]
*  We're still arguing about whether or not we should use the word oligarchy. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=392.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=395.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  Well, it is an oligarchy. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=396.8s)]
*  Which is what Senator Slotkin from your party was criticizing Bernie Sanders. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=398.0s)]
*  You saw there's a money piece of it. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=401.70000000000005s)]
*  And I do want to talk about the bill that's going through Congress and the need for a more populist economic agenda. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=404.1s)]
*  But before we get to that, just on Trump and the sense of a fight, the voters saying deer in the headlights. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  Tim Walz saying roadkill. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=415.5s)]
*  I look at the Democratic Party and I wonder, do you have the right leaders for this moment? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=417.3s)]
*  Hakim Jeffery, your leader in the House, was asked on CNN about Congressman Jerry Nadler's staffer, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=421.7s)]
*  who was arrested by the Department of Homeland Security in Congress. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=427.8s)]
*  They had a cusp put on him. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=430.90000000000003s)]
*  This is where we're heading. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=432.6s)]
*  We've had a mayor arrested in New Jersey. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=433.3s)]
*  We've had a fellow congressman being charged. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=435.6s)]
*  This is what Hakim Jeffery said. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=439.90000000000003s)]
*  Let's have a listen. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=441.3s)]
*  We will make that decision in a time, place and manner of our choosing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=442.1s)]
*  But the response will be continuous and it will meet the moment that is required. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=447.20000000000005s)]
*  What exactly does that mean? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=454.6s)]
*  Have you not decided how to respond? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=456.0s)]
*  I mean, in that moment, we are all Dana Bash. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=458.20000000000005s)]
*  What does that mean exactly? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  That would have been my question. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=462.0s)]
*  You have Democratic members of Congress, Democratic staffers, liberal judges, mayors being detained and arrested by a pretty fascistic administration. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  And your leader in the House says, we will respond in a time, place manner of our choosing, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=470.3s)]
*  but we won't take our foot off the pedal or whatever else. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=474.6s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=476.7s)]
*  I do not know. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=478.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=479.6s)]
*  I don't. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=480.1s)]
*  What do you think the response should be from the Democratic Party to this? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=480.8s)]
*  More than words. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=484.2s)]
*  I think that the response should be in action. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=485.90000000000003s)]
*  I think that we have to stop doing this thing where we pretend that there's still goodness [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=487.5s)]
*  or something worth protecting over on the Republican side of the aisle. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that we are so busy thinking and living in this nostalgia for a bipartisanship, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=496.8s)]
*  for a civility that just does not exist anymore. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=504.0s)]
*  I wasn't in office when they would have friends on the other side of the aisle. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=507.09999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't exist anymore. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=511.8s)]
*  And I think that we are still dealing with the Republicans. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=513.0s)]
*  You don't hang out with Marjorie Taylor Green and the Fed side? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=515.4s)]
*  I have not been invited yet. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=517.4s)]
*  But you know, if we were, I would not go. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=519.2s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=521.5s)]
*  It's why I don't do bipartisan sports. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=522.0s)]
*  It's why I'm not on the baseball team. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=524.2s)]
*  Because at the end of the day, our country's on fire. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=525.7s)]
*  This is even worse than bipartisanship. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=527.7s)]
*  This is Hakeem Jeffries saying, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=529.2s)]
*  But I think that's what it is. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to really do anything about this. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't know what that means. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=533.4000000000001s)]
*  We'll decide in a manner of our choosing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=534.2s)]
*  Is he the right man for this moment to be leading the Democrats in the House? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=536.1s)]
*  I think that the American people are going to actually have a real good question about that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=542.1s)]
*  And I don't mean just two years down the line. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean every single day because we don't have a lot of time. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=544.5s)]
*  We just don't. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=547.5s)]
*  You would prefer your party to have much stronger leadership right now? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=548.3000000000001s)]
*  I would prefer across the board that we do. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=551.1s)]
*  And I mean within our party. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=554.3s)]
*  I mean that we are going to have to have strong leadership. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=556.0s)]
*  And this is no indictment. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=558.5s)]
*  Just saying we're frank. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=560.0999999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to need strong leadership from the party. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=562.1999999999999s)]
*  Strong leadership from Labour. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=563.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=565.6999999999999s)]
*  Our outside organizations, our movements. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=566.1999999999999s)]
*  We are going to need every piece of this puzzle to be in fighting trim right now. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=568.5s)]
*  And I think that maybe we are all still waking up late. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=572.8s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=575.9s)]
*  Maybe the alarm went off and we're still hitting snooze. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=576.0999999999999s)]
*  And I think that the moment to hit snooze is going to have to end everywhere. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=579.5s)]
*  Since you mentioned snooze, can we talk about Chuck Schumer, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=582.5s)]
*  the leader of your party in the Senate, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=586.0s)]
*  who is part of the gerontocracy, some might say. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=588.6999999999999s)]
*  Lost control of the Senate, but still the leader. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=592.5s)]
*  Sometimes people quit when they lose an election. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=595.1s)]
*  But he's still in charge. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  And he's now sounding more hawkish than Donald Trump when it comes to the Middle East. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=598.4s)]
*  Trump claims to be negotiating a new nuclear deal. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=603.3s)]
*  Whether that happens or not, we will see. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=606.0s)]
*  But this was Chuck Schumer's response on behalf of your party. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=607.6999999999999s)]
*  Let's play that. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=610.6s)]
*  When it comes to negotiating with the terrorist government of Iran, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=611.6s)]
*  Trump's all over the lot. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=615.5s)]
*  What kind of bull is this? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=616.6s)]
*  They're going to sound tough in public and then have a side deal that lets Iran get away with everything? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=618.3000000000001s)]
*  That's outrageous. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=622.8000000000001s)]
*  We need to make that side deal public. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=623.9s)]
*  Any side deal should be before Congress and most importantly, the American people. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=626.1s)]
*  If Taco Trump is already folding, the American public should know about it. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=630.6s)]
*  In this moment, the Democrats have lost a lot of people who stayed at home, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=635.0s)]
*  sat on the couch because of Gaza. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=639.1s)]
*  They've lost a lot of young people who think you're out of touch. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=641.1s)]
*  Donald Trump is playing this, I'm anti-war guy, even though he's not really, but he's playing the role. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=643.7s)]
*  And Schumer thinks now is the time to move to the right on foreign policy and sound super hawkish on Iran. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=649.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not going with him. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=653.7s)]
*  When you say he speaks for our party, he speaks for him. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=654.9s)]
*  I think that that is the wrong... [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, he does speak for your party, whether you like it or not. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  He does. He does. He does. He does. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=660.5s)]
*  But he's the Senate minority leader. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=661.5s)]
*  He speaks for the Senate minority. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=663.1s)]
*  He speaks for the Senate. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=664.6s)]
*  And I think, unfortunately, he speaks for a lot of elected Democrats. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=666.4s)]
*  But what we realized from polling, what we know from just the last two years is that he does not speak for the majority of Americans [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=669.1s)]
*  when it comes to our interaction and our engagement in the Middle East, when it comes to Palestine and Gaza. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=675.9s)]
*  Right? The average American, not just American, we're talking every international human rights organization, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=682.1s)]
*  even the new pope, right? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=689.4s)]
*  The old pope, the new pope, the UN, the Doctors Without Borders. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=691.2s)]
*  So many people have looked at that and rightfully called it what it is, are recognizing that this is a genocide, that this is a forced famine. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=694.4s)]
*  We have seen the atrocities that have taken place. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=702.5s)]
*  And the average American does not want this to happen. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=705.0s)]
*  We don't want bombs to continue. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=707.5s)]
*  So I think it's actually really ironic to say that it should come before Congress. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=708.9s)]
*  Chuck Schumer suggested it might be anti-Semitic to say it's a genocide. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=711.5s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=714.3s)]
*  I think that where people are systematically murdering civilians, not just murdering civilians, starving civilians, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=715.6999999999999s)]
*  where they are destroying civilian infrastructure, the universities, the hospitals, the homes, the roads, the businesses, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=724.1s)]
*  we are running out of room for anything else to call it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=731.3000000000001s)]
*  I've got to ask you this question. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=735.3000000000001s)]
*  It's a bit of a personal question, but I've got to ask. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=736.9s)]
*  As a congresswoman who speaks very passionately on this issue, is calling it as she sees it, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=738.4s)]
*  using the G word genocide, saying people are being murdered. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=742.7s)]
*  That's all happening with American arms and American funding. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=746.0s)]
*  That is your colleagues. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=748.8000000000001s)]
*  Forget the Republicans. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=749.7s)]
*  That is Democrats. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=750.5s)]
*  Colleagues of ours who you do hang out with, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=751.9s)]
*  who you do see, who are in your party, who are I'm sure friends of yours. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=753.8s)]
*  They are voting to keep sending that money and those weapons to Israel. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=758.0s)]
*  What is that like for you to be in that party, in those hallways of power? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=762.3s)]
*  As someone who can see what's happening, unlike others who are kind of see no evil, hear no evil, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=766.6999999999999s)]
*  you're seeing the images on your social media. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=770.8s)]
*  You're acknowledging it's a genocide. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=772.4s)]
*  And then you go to work and you're with these people who are like, nah, it's fine. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=774.3s)]
*  Well, actually, before we ever say that, I'm friends with anyone who's quite there. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=778.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to use that word loosely. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=782.1s)]
*  I think it's devastating. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=783.7s)]
*  As somebody who, my ancestors, my people have gone through atrocities. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=786.4s)]
*  We've gone through kidnapping and enslavement and Jim Crow. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=790.9s)]
*  And to see people today turn a blind eye to that is really discouraging. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=795.4s)]
*  Because I think that maybe we're having different conversations, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=799.2s)]
*  or maybe they desperately want us to pretend we're having different conversations. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  But to call out and to say that if I believe in human rights, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=807.4s)]
*  then I don't believe that a civilian child in Israel should be killed any more than a civilian child in Palestine, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=810.6s)]
*  any more than a civilian child in America, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=817.6s)]
*  that I don't believe that we should put a hierarchy on life. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=819.7s)]
*  To say that feels like a basic democratic value, the basic democratic policy. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=822.4s)]
*  And I think that it's really discouraging, it's really infuriating, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=828.2s)]
*  and quite frankly, quite unacceptable that we would still take that line. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=831.9s)]
*  And I think that history will judge us harshly. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=835.5s)]
*  But I also think that there is still time to come over. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=837.3s)]
*  I think that there's still time to do the right thing. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=839.5s)]
*  For me, as I talk to constituents, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=841.9s)]
*  as I talk to people very passionately who believe differently than them, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=844.1s)]
*  I always have to respond at the end of the day that you are asking me as a... [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=847.6s)]
*  I'm not a civilian, I'm a member of a government who has the power of life and death in my vote. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=851.5s)]
*  I have the power to authorize a bomb be dropped on a child. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=857.1s)]
*  And to ask me to do that is unconscionable to me. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=860.9s)]
*  So I try to frame it that way. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=863.9s)]
*  I try to frame it in that way in hopes that it would resonate with somebody. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=865.1s)]
*  The majority of your fellow Democrats don't see it that way. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=868.4s)]
*  I know, a majority of Democratic voters do, though. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=870.5s)]
*  Yes, the voters do. I'm talking about your colleagues in the House. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=872.8s)]
*  And I think that, again, as we talk about money and politics, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=875.1s)]
*  as we talk about what are the influences on our government, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=878.6s)]
*  I think that there are people who would have never taken this sort of stance [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=881.1s)]
*  if the lobbying arm of this conflict didn't exist as it does. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=884.3s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people... [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=887.9s)]
*  The pressure from AIPAC on some of your colleagues. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=888.6s)]
*  Yeah, pressure from... [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=889.8s)]
*  And it's not just pressure from AIPAC, right? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=890.8s)]
*  It's pressure from the government that this has become a norm. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=892.6s)]
*  It has become a norm to see Israel and put it in its own special category [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=895.3000000000001s)]
*  and then to put Palestine in its own special category. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=900.0s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people aren't thinking about this [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=902.3000000000001s)]
*  the way they would think about any other conflict in the world. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=904.5s)]
*  It's interesting that you say history will judge harshly, which I agree with you. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=907.9000000000001s)]
*  There's the book from Omar al-Aqad, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=910.4000000000001s)]
*  which is, one day everyone will always have been against this line that resonates. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=912.1s)]
*  And I was thinking of that when I saw Matthew Miller, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=916.3000000000001s)]
*  former State Department spokesman under President Biden, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=918.1s)]
*  who poo-pooed my colleague Prem Taka and others who asked about war crimes. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=920.7s)]
*  He said, no, there's no war crimes in Gaza. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=924.6s)]
*  Now he's doing interviews having left government saying, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=926.4s)]
*  oh, well, I think there were war crimes, but I couldn't say it because I was in government. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=928.3s)]
*  But we see that with every conflict, every era in human rights, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=931.6s)]
*  Everybody today... [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=936.0s)]
*  Most people today probably say that they believed in Martin Luther King's dream. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=938.1s)]
*  But when Martin Luther King was alive, that man was persecuted. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=941.2s)]
*  That man was prosecuted. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=944.7s)]
*  He was arrested. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=946.6s)]
*  He was... [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=947.4s)]
*  His house was firebombed. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=948.2s)]
*  His family was in danger. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=949.2s)]
*  The rewriting of history. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=950.6s)]
*  Colombia does it with protests, right? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=951.6s)]
*  They lift up the protests of the past while talking about the protests of today in Vietnam. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=953.9s)]
*  Everyone says they were against the Iraq war now, like Donald Trump, who was for it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=958.0s)]
*  Everybody. We had one vote. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=960.8s)]
*  We had one vote against the Iraq war. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=962.0999999999999s)]
*  The question, though, on the Democrats and Biden, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=964.0999999999999s)]
*  because obviously people come to you and talk to you in Pennsylvania about how upset they are and stuff. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=967.5s)]
*  Trump... [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=970.9s)]
*  I don't believe Trump is better for Gaza than Joe Biden. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=971.8s)]
*  But what Trump does do so well is he gives the impression of... [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=974.0s)]
*  He makes anti-war noises. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=978.0999999999999s)]
*  He sends Steve Witkoff to have negotiations. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=980.1999999999999s)]
*  He had that fake ceasefire for the inauguration that was in there for a few weeks, but we knew it wouldn't last. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=983.0s)]
*  He sent a guy to talk to Hamas directly, which pissed off the Israelis, but then he throws Hamas. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=988.1999999999999s)]
*  All of that is... [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=992.6999999999999s)]
*  My point is, he looks like he's doing something to a lot of average low-information voters. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=993.4s)]
*  I talked to friends about it. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=998.0s)]
*  But he looks like he's doing something in a way that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris never looked like they were doing anything substantive. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=999.3s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1004.6999999999999s)]
*  I think that Democrats are leaving our own people vulnerable. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1005.4s)]
*  And I think that what Donald Trump does well is he plays off of the vulnerability of people [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1008.8s)]
*  who have been pushed to the margins. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1012.4s)]
*  I think we've seen that. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1013.9s)]
*  We've seen it in the past, and we're definitely seeing it with Gaza, right? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1014.8s)]
*  People who are incredibly passionate about this. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1018.0s)]
*  People who are deeply impacted. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1019.6999999999999s)]
*  There are people whose family members live in Gaza. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1021.4s)]
*  People whose family live in the West Bank. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1024.7s)]
*  People who are living through this every day, and they're just looking for a crumb. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1026.2s)]
*  They're looking for any sort of acknowledgement that this has to stop. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1030.2s)]
*  And when Donald Trump does that, he doesn't just do it with Gaza, right? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1034.5s)]
*  He does it with African American history. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1036.9s)]
*  He does it with black folks. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1039.2s)]
*  He does it with people who the party has not really embraced wholeheartedly. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1041.0s)]
*  And I think it's why it's important that we get back to the business of expanding the electorate [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1045.7s)]
*  instead of continuing to punch left. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1050.1000000000001s)]
*  And sometimes we spend more time punching left than we do exposing the right. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1051.7s)]
*  Exposing their games, and we're leaving people. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1055.3000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of Democrats are saying, no, no, no, we are exposing them. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1059.0s)]
*  You've got this, quote, big, beautiful bill, this ridiculous bill that's gone through the House, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1061.7s)]
*  now is in the Senate. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1065.2s)]
*  It's been called the largest upward transfer of wealth in American history. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1066.6000000000001s)]
*  Democrats are talking a lot about the cuts to Medicaid and to SNAP. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1070.2s)]
*  I think there's pretty serious party discipline. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1072.9s)]
*  But we're talking to people who we've pushed aside. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1075.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1078.4s)]
*  And are you offering an alternative, is the question. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1079.0s)]
*  When you say Medicaid's being cut, but are you offering universal health care in response? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1081.2s)]
*  I think that we should. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1085.5s)]
*  I think that this is the precise moment to talk about these things, right? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1086.5s)]
*  This is going to be the biggest cut to Medicaid in history, the biggest cut to SNAP benefits in history. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1089.2s)]
*  What's going to happen to the people who now can't eat? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1094.0s)]
*  What's going to happen to the people who have now lost their services, their health care? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1096.3s)]
*  Well, we need to talk about not where we want to get back to, because a lot of Americans were like, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1099.9s)]
*  that wasn't good where we were. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1105.3000000000002s)]
*  They're already forward thinking and we have to catch up. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1107.2s)]
*  So I think the problem is that we're playing from behind where we're supposed to be leading from the front. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1110.0s)]
*  And we do need alternatives. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1114.9s)]
*  We do need our own. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1118.3000000000002s)]
*  When we think about corruption, how are we going to lead on corruption in a way that heals [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1119.4s)]
*  not just what the executive branch is exposed as our own weaknesses, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1125.6999999999998s)]
*  but how are we going to get us to a point where government actually functions the way we need it to? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1130.6999999999998s)]
*  And I don't think we do that enough. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1135.1s)]
*  Hard to play defense and offense at the same time. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1137.3999999999999s)]
*  I got asked one quick question about Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1140.1s)]
*  who revealed she hadn't even read the bill. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1143.3999999999999s)]
*  If she had, she would have voted against it due to the language around AI. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1145.5s)]
*  Part of me wants to say this is the cult of Trump, that they'll vote for anything he puts in front of them. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1149.6s)]
*  But generally speaking, as someone who's not been in Congress that long, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1153.4s)]
*  were you surprised at how many people vote for bills that they don't read? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1156.6000000000001s)]
*  Some of your colleagues both on both sides of the aisle? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1159.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm not. I am surprised by the amount of people who will admit that they didn't read it. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1161.0s)]
*  We have one job. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1164.6000000000001s)]
*  Ma'am, you have one job to read the bill. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1165.7s)]
*  I don't think that that's a good enough answer. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1168.2s)]
*  And also, just like you, my first thought was, hey, you have one job. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1170.8000000000002s)]
*  My second thought was that's the cult, right? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1174.3000000000002s)]
*  That you're lying to people's face by saying, oh, well, if I had known, I wouldn't have done that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1176.5s)]
*  What stopped you from knowing? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1181.6000000000001s)]
*  You have a full staff. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1182.6s)]
*  No, you were afraid of going up against Trump while it was happening. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1183.8s)]
*  You get to have your cake and eat it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1187.6s)]
*  I would have voted against it, but you didn't vote it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1188.6s)]
*  We're out of time, but I do want to ask about you mentioned the history of your people. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1190.6s)]
*  And we talk about Donald Trump's racism and people are still debating whether Donald Trump's a racist. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1194.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, insane. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1198.3s)]
*  Ten years into his appearance on the political stage. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1199.6999999999998s)]
*  Right now, he's gone out of his way to end refugee resettlement from everywhere in the world, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1203.1999999999998s)]
*  except for the fake white genocide in South Africa. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1208.6999999999998s)]
*  Like if you were writing a Netflix show and Trump was the character, you would say that's an unrealistic storyline. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1211.8s)]
*  You mean he stops all the refugees except for the white ones from South Africa. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1216.8s)]
*  But they've done it. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1220.4s)]

*  We're still debating whether or not he is or is not racist, whether or not his policies are racial. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1225.6000000000001s)]
*  Listen, it is not just that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1232.4s)]
*  It's just the attacks on DEI. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1234.0s)]
*  Now, if you're a black person, you're a brown person. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1237.3s)]
*  If you go on social media, you can't talk about the weather without having a horde of just like racist trolls [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1239.1s)]
*  come into your social media and call you a DEI or worse. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1245.0s)]
*  Black people in public. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1248.8s)]

*  It's a new N-word for black people in public. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1251.3s)]
*  It is. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1252.3s)]
*  But what they're doing is they're intentionally moving the culture so that it's harder and harder and harder for us [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1252.8s)]
*  to get back on track or harder for us to bring people to combat what they're doing. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1257.6999999999998s)]
*  Because that's why I said it's not just Trump. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1263.0s)]

*  It's not just going to be the big beautiful bill, the unseriously named. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1275.6s)]
*  It's going to be the culture shift that he was able to create in a way that no other person who is, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXhUQyDUWaI&t=1280.3s)]
