Video Description: “It’s going to be continued attacks on medication, abortion as well as contraception. We've already seen them make some moves where they allow governments to classify certain forms of contraception as abortifacients and therefore allow businesses to get out of providing contraception coverage.”
Author Leah Litman joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss how Republicans used a victim mentality as strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade, what’s next for the Supreme Court Justices to roll back and her thoughts on Trump potentially running for a third term. In her book, ‘Lawless,’ she compares the Republican Justices as the ‘Plastics’ from ‘Mean Girls’ and dives into the influence of these justices on American politics.

# What Republicans are Planning Next to Strip Away Women’s Rights
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg)
*  In recent weeks, Donald Trump and his administration have been calling on the Supreme Court to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=0.0s)]
*  step in to overturn injunctions related to birthright citizenship, trans-military bans, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=4.68s)]
*  and the massive downsizing of the federal government. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=10.28s)]
*  The conservative supermajority on the Supreme Court, of which Trump himself filled three [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=13.24s)]
*  seats in his first term, granted the president a temporary victory to ban trans troops from [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=17.46s)]
*  the military, but issued a decisive unanimous decision ordering his administration to facilitate [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=22.52s)]
*  the return of a man wrongly sent to El Salvador. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=27.62s)]
*  While Trump is banking on the Supreme Court to move his agenda forward, there's one person [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=30.62s)]
*  watching the court and its conservative justices very closely. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=34.38s)]
*  Leah Lippman, a law professor at the University of Michigan Law School and co-host of the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=38.22s)]
*  podcast Strict Scrutiny, which examines the Supreme Court and the legal culture that surrounds [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=42.06s)]
*  it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=46.58s)]
*  Lippman is also the author of the new book, Lawless, How the Supreme Court Runs on Conservative [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=47.58s)]
*  Grievance, Fringe Theories, and Bad Vibes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=51.5s)]
*  In the book, she compares the bad vibes of the conservatives on the Supreme Court to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=54.72s)]
*  the plastics the group in the movie Mean Girls, who she writes, act like jerks and clear the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=58.64s)]
*  way for others to do the same, all while insisting they're the real victims. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=63.4s)]
*  She also argues that efforts to roll back voting rights are the Republicans' version [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=67.52s)]
*  of the Red Wedding from the Game of Thrones, and it's efforts to reverse reproductive [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=71.4s)]
*  freedom are akin to the kensurrection from the Barbie movie. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=75.52s)]
*  But while Lippman has a particular gift to connect iconic pieces of pop culture to what's [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  happening in the country's highest court, her book makes clear that what the conservative [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=83.04s)]
*  justices are doing right now is no laughing matter. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=87.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Leah Lippman. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=90.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=92.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=95.24s)]
*  I'm super excited to be here and thank you for the generous intro. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=96.24s)]
*  Tell me about the book and why you chose this moment as the right time to write and publish [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=99.0s)]
*  it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=104.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=105.32s)]
*  So my co-host and I started the podcast in 2019 when Brett Kavanaugh was replacing Justice [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=106.32s)]
*  Anthony Kennedy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=110.88s)]
*  And it felt like at that moment people did not appreciate exactly how significant this [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  change would be for the Supreme Court. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=116.2s)]
*  Even in the moment when the Supreme Court was hearing the case about whether to overrule [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=118.76s)]
*  Roe, a lot of people were still insisting they're not going to do it, they're not going [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=122.2s)]
*  to do it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=125.44s)]
*  Once they did, people are assuming, well, they're kind of done with their work. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=126.44s)]
*  Now they're going to stand up to Donald Trump. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=129.64s)]
*  And I need people to be socialized in a very different picture of the Supreme Court and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=131.2s)]
*  understand how what's happening today is the product of a much longer political and social [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=135.96s)]
*  movement that has designs on many big things. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=140.96s)]
*  In the book, you wrote about how the Supreme Court has slowly been chipping away at reproductive [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  rights on its way to ultimately overturning Roe in 2022. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=149.16s)]
*  But you wrote, overturning Roe is not the ultimate destination of the movement that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=153.44s)]
*  led to the end of Roe. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=157.02s)]
*  It is one step on a longer journey to restore a gender hierarchy in which the Kens, as in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=158.32s)]
*  the Kens from the Barbie movie, dominate public life. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=163.0s)]
*  What do you think is the next legal step coming down the track for anti-choice Republicans [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=166.48s)]
*  on the court in terms of stripping rights away from women? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=171.64s)]
*  I think it's going to be continued attacks on medication abortion as well as contraception. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=175.28s)]
*  We've already seen them make some moves where they allow governments to classify certain [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=180.32s)]
*  forms of contraception as abortifacients and therefore allow businesses to get out of providing [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=184.92s)]
*  contraception coverage. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=191.14s)]
*  And I think a next move is going to be, well, when a government tries to restrict access [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=192.6s)]
*  to contraception, is this Supreme Court going to say they are entitled to view certain kinds [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=197.12s)]
*  of contraception as facilitating abortion? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=202.28s)]
*  You also break down the 303 Creative case in the book, which saw the Supreme Court rule [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=206.16s)]
*  in favor of a designer who didn't want to design a wedding website for a gay couple [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=210.6s)]
*  due to her religious beliefs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=214.6s)]
*  And it wasn't just the ruling you say that was problematic. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=216.44s)]
*  The entire case was basically a setup. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=218.64s)]
*  As you wrote, the designer had never actually designed a wedding website for any clients [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  ever. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=224.72s)]
*  The company didn't market itself as designing wedding websites. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=225.72s)]
*  And the request to design a same-sex wedding website came from a man who turned out to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=227.48s)]
*  be a wedding designer who was already married to a woman. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=231.27999999999997s)]
*  You call it a made-up case. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=234.11999999999998s)]
*  It does sound like a made-up case. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  My question to you is, right now, are you seeing other made-up cases that conservatives [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  are using to push their agenda through the court? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=241.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  So this same organization that was behind the quest to try to roll back marriage equality [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=246.04s)]
*  and LGBT civil rights is also the organization that is behind the attacks on medication abortion. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=251.6s)]
*  So they incorporated this organization in a particular place in Texas to allow them [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=256.6s)]
*  to challenge medication abortion in Texas. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=261.48s)]
*  And I think this same group is very much having designs on trying to move us toward something [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=264.52s)]
*  called fetal personhood, the idea that fetuses have people and therefore have rights under [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=269.48s)]
*  the Constitution, and therefore the Constitution requires abortion to be banned nationwide. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=275.1s)]
*  If I could just say something super quick about 303 Creative, because that case in my [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=281.08000000000004s)]
*  mind perfectly encapsulates this idea that they view themselves as victims and use that [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=284.62s)]
*  to victimize everyone else. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  Because in that case, they said that wedding website designer who wouldn't make the wedding [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=292.36s)]
*  website for a same-sex wedding, she wasn't discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=296.54s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  Because she'd refused to make a wedding website for a straight couple that wanted to celebrate [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  a same-sex wedding. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=306.52000000000004s)]
*  Pause. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=308.16s)]
*  Makes no sense, but that was their line. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  At the same time, they insisted the real victim in the case is this poor wedding website designer [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=311.12s)]
*  who I guess couldn't get out of bed because she'd have to copy paste some text onto a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  website celebrating a same-sex wedding. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=320.28000000000003s)]

*  You... [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  Actually, before we go any further, I've got to ask one question about Amy Coney Barrett, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  who conservatives now hate because she kind of ruled once or twice against the kind of [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  hard-right agenda. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=349.16s)]
*  John Roberts has obviously set himself up as the chief justice as the new swing voter. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=350.6s)]
*  He reliably votes on all the stuff he cares about, the voting rights stuff. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=355.36s)]
*  He's a hardcore conservative. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=358.16s)]
*  But he knows that he needs to kind of show some fake balance and he votes with liberals. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=359.68s)]
*  Amy Coney Barrett has really surprised a lot of people. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=364.96s)]
*  She was one of Trump's three picks. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=366.96s)]
*  People are very upset with her. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=368.44s)]
*  What do you make of Amy Coney Barrett's position? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=369.92s)]
*  So I think it is really overstated. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=373.24s)]
*  I think the media and commentators love to overemphasize and focus on the differences [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=375.2s)]
*  between the Republican justices and ignore their many similarities. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=379.74s)]
*  She was lockstep with the Republican colleagues on immunity and other important executive [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=383.64s)]
*  power cases. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=388.24s)]
*  She's to the right of John Roberts on certain voting rights issues. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=389.48s)]
*  So spare me whatever for this idea that she is this moderate liberal squish who's going [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=392.76s)]
*  to save us. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=398.76s)]
*  Yeah, the Supreme Court is a classic place where the Overton window is shifted all the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=399.76s)]
*  time. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=403.48s)]
*  It's like, Amy Coney Barrett, she's not far right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=404.48s)]
*  She's just right. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=406.48s)]
*  And it's kind of like, well, Anthony Kennedy was a reliable conservative, but he ended [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  his career retiring as, oh, he was this liberal middle ground guy. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Anyways, I'll rant away another time. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=414.88s)]
*  One thing that surprised me was the 9-0 unanimous ruling on bringing back Kilmour Brigham-Gussell. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=416.92s)]
*  Where the court said you must facilitate the return and Trump, this is a man wrongly sent [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=423.36s)]
*  to El Salvador's Gulag. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=427.88s)]
*  And the Trump people not just ignored the Supreme Court decision, but Trump says, actually [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=429.68s)]
*  we won. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=433.84s)]
*  Stephen Miller tells me I won this case and just completely just says up is down, black [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  is white, hot is cold. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=438.42s)]
*  My question to you is people like Chuck Schumer say we'll be in a constitutional crisis if [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=440.0s)]
*  Trump ignores the Supreme Court. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=445.24s)]
*  He already has, hasn't he? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=447.64s)]
*  So aren't we already in one? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=448.64s)]
*  I mean, I think they keep moving the goalposts for what a constitutional crisis is. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=450.82s)]
*  In my mind, a constitutional crisis is a system where the separation of powers breaks down. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=454.86s)]
*  There's no respect for the rule of law. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=459.38s)]
*  You have a legislative branch that is rolling over and allowing the executive branch to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=460.9s)]
*  usurp their powers and a Supreme Court that is fundamentally uninterested in doing anything [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=464.64s)]
*  about that. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=468.9s)]
*  You know, I agree the Kilmour-Abrego-Garcia case, in my view, is a pretty clear instance [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=469.9s)]
*  of the president defying a Supreme Court order. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=474.3s)]
*  On the other hand, I think they reached a unanimous decision by building in some compromises [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=476.98s)]
*  to that opinion that gave the president significant wiggle room. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=482.66s)]
*  They told the lower court, you can order facilitation, but what you can't do is order the government [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=485.58000000000004s)]
*  to effectuate the return, i.e. bring about it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=491.1s)]
*  They also added language requiring the district court to give due regard and deference to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=494.14000000000004s)]
*  the executive branch's power over foreign affairs. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=498.38s)]
*  And so of course, they've taken that language and run with it. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=501.24s)]
*  And I think that's part of what has allowed them to drag out these proceedings. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=503.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny that they didn't have any deference for US foreign policy when Joe Biden [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=507.08s)]
*  was trying to end Remain in Mexico and random district court judges were saying, you can't [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=511.2s)]
*  do that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=514.96s)]
*  You can't end it. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=515.96s)]
*  Well, he's a Democrat. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=516.96s)]
*  He doesn't get to exercise political power. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=517.96s)]
*  He's a Democrat. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=518.96s)]
*  The rules are different for Democrats. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=519.96s)]
*  In 2021, the Vice President, JD Vance, then just a junior senator from Ohio who hadn't [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=520.96s)]
*  fully rolled over for Trump to get back in his good books, said on a conservative podcast [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=525.6s)]
*  that if Trump came back into office, he should fire thousands of federal government employees. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=530.0s)]
*  And if the Supreme Court tried to stop him, he should just say, and I quote, the chief [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  justice has made his ruling. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=539.4799999999999s)]
*  Now let him enforce it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=541.4799999999999s)]
*  In a way, Vance is right, isn't he? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=543.92s)]
*  The Supreme Court can't enforce their decisions if they're up against a president who just [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=546.76s)]
*  says no. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=552.36s)]
*  They depend upon norms, precedents, conventions. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=554.2199999999999s)]
*  They don't have a Supreme Court armed force. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=557.72s)]
*  So that's true. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=561.2s)]
*  But I would say two things. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=562.2s)]
*  One, Vance is wrong about that quote. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=563.2s)]
*  It's a myth that Andrew Jackson ever said that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=565.4s)]
*  And the reality is, is Andrew Jackson quickly turned tail and helped the Supreme Court enforce [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=568.28s)]
*  their decisions against South Carolina that was trying to resist them. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=572.46s)]
*  So he needs to check a history book and read a little bit further. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=576.4s)]
*  But second, while the Supreme Court might not have an army, courts do have significant [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=580.52s)]
*  powers to enforce their decisions. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=584.4s)]
*  They can initiate criminal contempt proceedings. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=586.58s)]
*  So even if the executive branch is unwilling to bring a criminal case, they can appoint [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=589.0600000000001s)]
*  a prosecutor to do so. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=593.1s)]
*  The president might opt to pardon the individual. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=594.64s)]
*  But to my mind, courts should still force them to do so and make them pay the political [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=597.1s)]
*  price and increase the salience. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=602.0200000000001s)]
*  They can also award civil contempt and try to go after the individual assets of individual [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=604.0400000000001s)]
*  employees. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=610.14s)]
*  So I think courts actually have a lot of power. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=611.1400000000001s)]
*  It's just unfortunate that many of them seem unwilling to exercise it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=614.18s)]
*  They don't want the crisis that we're already in. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=618.7399999999999s)]
*  But just on the criminal point, just to be clear for our viewers, normally if somebody's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=623.66s)]
*  held in contempt of court, let's say someone doesn't show up to court or ignores a judge's [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=627.9s)]
*  clear ruling, the judge can say, marshals, go get them and put them in a jail cell. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=631.14s)]
*  In this case, the marshals answer to the DOJ, which answers to Pam Bondi, who answers [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=637.04s)]
*  to Donald Trump, Lord King Emperor. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=641.92s)]
*  There's not really anything the judge could do in that situation, could they? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=644.42s)]
*  So two things. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=648.5999999999999s)]
*  One is, aside from just saying, you're in contempt, marshals, go get them, they can [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=649.64s)]
*  actually launch a criminal case. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=654.4799999999999s)]
*  So they can appoint outside lawyers who would begin a prosecution and be able to, again, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=656.28s)]
*  leverage the power of the law against them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  In the event they want to deploy the US marshals, it's true, technically, they are under the [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=663.7199999999999s)]
*  control of the Department of Justice. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=667.9s)]
*  But I think that that possibility, the US marshals not doing anything, assumes that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=669.78s)]
*  every single US marshal would refuse to carry out an illegal command. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=675.1s)]
*  So I am hesitant to suggest people should be obeying in advance, basically, by assuming [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=679.8199999999999s)]
*  the courts lack all authority and just saying, well, there's nothing they can do. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=685.4599999999999s)]
*  That's a very good point. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=689.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court recently held oral arguments in the case regarding Trump's executive order [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=690.48s)]
*  eliminating birthright citizenship. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=694.28s)]
*  And a lot of those arguments had very little to do with the actual birthright citizenship [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=695.62s)]
*  constitutional amendment case. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=699.52s)]
*  But they were about whether federal judges, district judges have the power to implement [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=701.3s)]
*  or impose nationwide injunctions, which have blocked a lot of the Trump administration [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=706.36s)]
*  agenda, but also the Biden administration's agenda. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=710.24s)]
*  What is your view on this whole idea that lower level judges can injunct nationwide? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=713.94s)]
*  Because as I say, it hurt Biden and Democrats as well. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=720.04s)]
*  It hasn't just hurt Trump. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=723.16s)]
*  There is this argument from Stephen Miller, ironically, who went injunction shopping under [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=725.16s)]
*  Biden, who now says it's outrageous that some lower court judge can stop the elected president [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=728.6800000000001s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  Where do you stand on that? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so two things. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=734.6800000000001s)]
*  One is I agree nationwide injunctions are problematic and that they're probably used [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=736.58s)]
*  too often. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=741.0s)]
*  But I also don't think they should be prohibited across the board. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=742.1400000000001s)]
*  And I think the birthright citizenship case is a perfect example of that. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=745.2800000000001s)]
*  How do you implement a state by state rule of citizenship? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=748.6800000000001s)]
*  The country has had uniform rules of citizenship for the better part of a century. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=751.9200000000001s)]
*  So I think there are certain cases that do call for nationwide injunctions, even if [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=756.36s)]
*  Republican appointees were abusing them under the Biden administration. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=761.4s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=765.72s)]
*  And then second is I just don't think the Biden Trump circumstances of nationwide injunctions [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=766.72s)]
*  are comparable despite Stephen Miller's efforts to equate them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=772.32s)]
*  Because the reality is, is almost all the nationwide injunctions against Biden were [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=776.16s)]
*  generated by a few judges in one or two circuits where the nominees were particularly unhinged. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=779.6s)]
*  Not the case. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=786.4000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=787.4000000000001s)]
*  Not the case for the injunctions against Donald Trump. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=788.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, the recent case about the two-year-old American who was basically kidnapped and sent [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=790.6s)]
*  to Honduras, that was a Trump judge who said that the child did not get due process. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=795.0s)]
*  That was not a Marxist as Stephen Miller's imagination unless Trump was nominating Marxist [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=799.0s)]
*  to the bench. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=803.24s)]
*  What are some Supreme Court cases, Leah, that are currently making headlines that you're [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=804.6600000000001s)]
*  watching out for very closely? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=808.48s)]
*  There's a lot of them. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=810.32s)]
*  And a part of me is worried that the Trump administration is drowning out. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=812.48s)]
*  A lot of the big things the court could do. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=815.56s)]
*  I think there are two cases that could radically transform the role of religion in public schools. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=817.76s)]
*  One is about whether school districts can include LGBTQ inclusive instructional materials [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=823.4s)]
*  in their curriculum, literally storybooks with LGBT characters. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=829.04s)]
*  A group of conservative religious parents are arguing that's unconstitutional. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=832.3199999999999s)]
*  Second is whether a state has to create a religious public charter school, which is [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=836.3199999999999s)]
*  nuts. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=840.88s)]
*  I think that the Constitution prohibited religious public schools. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=841.88s)]
*  Now the Republican appointees are about to say it's required. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=845.52s)]
*  They are literally, I think, about to say the separation of church and state is unconstitutional [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=849.52s)]
*  because it's ranked discrimination against religious conservatives. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=853.88s)]
*  Just a perfect encapsulation of this idea that conservative grievance is cannibalizing [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=857.92s)]
*  the law. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=862.96s)]
*  Finally, there's another case about whether certain attempts to enforce the Voting Rights [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=863.96s)]
*  Act and ensure the political representation of black voters is actually unconstitutional [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=868.48s)]
*  because it constitutes illegal unconstitutional racial discrimination against white voters. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=873.36s)]
*  So those three cases are definitely ones that I'm watching. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  When it comes to voting rights and gutting voting rights, Trump may have given a big [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=882.12s)]
*  gift to his allies on the Supreme Court in the form of his executive order, which makes [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=885.64s)]
*  changes to election laws in this country, includes requiring proof of US citizenship, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=889.9599999999999s)]
*  directing the attorney general to take action against states that count ballots that are [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=893.9599999999999s)]
*  received after Election Day and federal elections, which include the troops. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=897.4s)]
*  The proof of citizenship requirement has already been legally challenged. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=901.6s)]
*  If it makes its way up to the Supreme Court, we know that even John Roberts, the supposedly [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=905.8s)]
*  moderate Republican on the court, the one thing that unites those six, as you pointed [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=910.8s)]
*  out earlier, is basically gutting voting rights. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=915.28s)]
*  What do you think they do in terms of protecting voting rights in the 2026 midterms and the [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=919.0s)]
*  2028 presidential election? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=924.12s)]
*  I think it really depends what kind of case it is we're talking about that they would [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=926.48s)]
*  hear. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=930.28s)]
*  I think it also honestly depends on whether the margins in the election are what I call [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=931.28s)]
*  litigation proof, basically too large for a court to mess up. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=934.8s)]
*  So I think this executive order, I mean, that's so wildly unconstitutional because the president [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=938.78s)]
*  just doesn't have authority over voting rules and preconditions. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=943.48s)]
*  I'm not especially worried about that case, but I am worried about twisted perversions [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=947.12s)]
*  of this independent state legislature theory where they might try to throw out some votes [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=951.8s)]
*  that were cast under state court decisions that protected voting rights or whatnot. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=956.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's funny when the Democrats tried to do their federal election reform bill, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=961.24s)]
*  we were told no, only states should decide election laws. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=966.4s)]
*  And now Donald Trump comes along with an executive order to change federal election law. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=968.76s)]
*  Trump says he's not serious. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=972.9599999999999s)]
*  Sorry, Trump has said he's not joking necessarily in his interview with Kristen Welker and others [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  about running for a third term, right? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=979.2s)]
*  And his allies, Steve Bannon and others are talking about loopholes in the various amendments [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=982.08s)]
*  that ban him from running again. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=986.6s)]
*  Is there a scenario in which this Supreme Court says, actually, it's fine, he can run [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=989.2s)]
*  again because it's not that clear in the 22nd and 12th amendments? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=993.84s)]
*  So I always hesitate to say never, because on one hand, they basically rendered the disqualification [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=999.28s)]
*  for running for office after having engaged in an insurrection in the decision last term [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1008.68s)]
*  where they allowed Donald Trump to appear on the ballot again. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1013.16s)]
*  So that's one thing. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1015.72s)]
*  The second is, is a 22nd amendment is written in terms of not running for terms of office. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1017.04s)]
*  But no one thought to write a 22nd amendment that prohibited a vice president running or [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1024.32s)]
*  Trump running as vice president and then the president quickly resigning to give him back [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1029.8s)]
*  the presidency because no one thought that was required. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1033.72s)]
*  So I can see, right, the formalist, textualist Republican justices saying, well, it didn't [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1037.28s)]
*  say that, so therefore it's okay, which they love to do. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1042.6s)]
*  So I am concerned about it, but I just think there are many other more terrifying possibilities [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1047.16s)]
*  that require our attention right now. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1053.28s)]
*  Also, the idea that JD Vance would get elected and then say, okay, you be president, how [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1056.08s)]
*  he ever hold his head up high in public ever again? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1061.16s)]
*  I don't know what a coward and a freak you have to be to win the presidency of the United [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1064.64s)]
*  States and then just hand it over to Donald Trump. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1068.48s)]
*  He's already prostrated himself so much in front of Trump. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1070.96s)]
*  I think Usher wants to be first lady and she won't let him hand it over. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1076.3200000000002s)]
*  Anyway, we'll cross that bridge. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1080.0s)]
*  God help us all. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1081.0s)]
*  Last question here, at the end of the day, the Republicans took the Supreme Court seriously, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1082.44s)]
*  spent decades getting their people onto it, creating the Federalist Society pipeline, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1086.8000000000002s)]
*  basically from college all the way to the highest court in the land. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1091.48s)]
*  Stealing seats from the Democrats in the process. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1094.56s)]
*  Hello, Justice Gorsuch. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1096.8s)]
*  And then when Biden and the Democrats come to office, they kick a commission on Supreme [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1098.28s)]
*  Court reform into the long grass. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1102.84s)]
*  They mock the idea of quote unquote packing the court or what I would call rebalancing [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1104.82s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1109.6399999999999s)]
*  Aren't we in a situation right now where the Supreme Court is a conservative institution [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1110.6399999999999s)]
*  because Democrats didn't give it the same priority that Republicans did? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1116.0s)]
*  I think that is absolutely part of the story. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1119.72s)]
*  And part of the tragedy is Democrats took several opportunities and basically wished [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  away what was happening in front of their eyes. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1128.1200000000001s)]
*  So the Supreme Court in 1992 declined to overrule Roe versus Wade by a five to four vote. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1131.44s)]
*  Democrats took that as forever settling the issue of abortion and did not take the opportunities [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1137.28s)]
*  to actually adopt federal laws that would protect abortion rights. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  Even though it was quite obvious, the Republican Party still had their sets trained on overruling [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1145.52s)]
*  Roe versus Wade. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1151.36s)]
*  So I think many progressives and Democrats want to think, well, if I win this election, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1152.72s)]
*  if we win this election, if I sign this petition, we're just going to be able to fix it. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1156.8s)]
*  When that is not what the Republican Party did. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1160.48s)]
*  They engaged in this several decades long strategy that had some losses, setbacks along [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1162.92s)]
*  the way, and they were still willing to push for the court and keep their eyes set on the [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1168.36s)]
*  court. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1173.72s)]
*  That's what Democrats and progressives have to do as well. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1174.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm still seeing no signs of it amongst some of the Democrats who claim to be running, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1176.92s)]
*  we suggest they be running in 2028. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1180.92s)]
*  It's a tragedy that they completely wasted the last four years when they had a chance [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1184.64s)]
*  to do something. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1187.4s)]
*  Leah Lippman, thank you so much for coming on the show. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1188.4s)]
*  The book is called Lawless. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  It's out now. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1192.72s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1193.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9rXMcEpUg&t=1195.48s)]
