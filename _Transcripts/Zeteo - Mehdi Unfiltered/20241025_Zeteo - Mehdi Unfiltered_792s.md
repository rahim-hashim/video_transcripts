# What a Trump Presidency Would Look Like for Palestinians
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM)
*  So let's talk about what a Trump presidency would look like for the Palestinians and especially for Gaza, especially as the polls suggest, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=0.0s)]
*  we are very close to a second Trump presidency. Joining me now is Palestinian American political analyst Omar Bada. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=5.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on the show. Omar, what do you say to people who say, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=10.84s)]
*  Netanyahu has gotten everything he wants from Harris and Biden. He gets endless weapons, endless money, diplomatic support. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=15.92s)]
*  It doesn't matter if Donald Trump comes in in January 20th. It's all the same. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can see why that argument is appealing. The Biden-Harris policy so far on Palestine and Israel has been just a [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=27.36s)]
*  despicable horror from beginning to end. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=34.76s)]
*  It's been a year now of watching this genocide unfold day after day on our phones, tens of thousands of children being massacred, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=36.6s)]
*  people being starved to death, and all that Biden and Harris have done is occasionally express concern while just giving [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=43.2s)]
*  unrelenting military funding and diplomatic protection to allow this to continue. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=49.68s)]
*  And frankly, this should be the Biden-Harris legacy. They should never be able to get away from it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=53.64s)]
*  It should haunt them for the rest of their lives. Nonetheless, you can see that Netanyahu is interested in something even more ambitious. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  With the killing of Senoar, a lot of people thought that this was an off-ramp potentially for Netanyahu. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=64.16s)]
*  He knows he can't get the hostages back militarily. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=69.84s)]
*  It's obvious he doesn't give a damn about the hostages for anybody paying attention. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=72.84s)]
*  But he said that we're not going to stop this war because we need to secure our future. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=76.0s)]
*  And what he means by that is that he wants to get rid of Palestinians entirely. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=80.63999999999999s)]
*  Because as long as Palestinians exist, then Israel is stuck between a rock and a hard place. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=84.88s)]
*  It's a permanent apartheid state. They don't want to give them equal rights to Israeli citizens. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=90.0s)]
*  They don't want to give them a state of their own. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  And the longer that Israel remains being stuck as an apartheid state, the entire world is going to be turning against that state and isolating it more and more. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=95.91999999999999s)]
*  And he sees an opportunity right now in the middle of all the chaos of setting his sights really high and needing an administration in power [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=104.48s)]
*  to really make the process of eliminating Palestinians entirely a little bit easier for him [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  without the constant tension and resistance that he meets with with the Biden administration. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=116.88s)]
*  Grossly inadequate. But the constant talking from the Biden administration about admitting publicly that Israel is indiscriminately bombing civilians in Gaza, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=121.12s)]
*  saying they're not doing enough on humanitarian aid, saying they object to the permanent reoccupation of Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  All of this creates a PR cost for Israel that makes it harder for them to accelerate their mission of obliterating Palestinians entirely and getting rid of them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  And what evidence do we have? Do you think the Republicans are fully on board with that mission? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=142.8s)]
*  I mean, look, there's a bit of a paradox here in that Biden, on the one hand, is deeply invested in Israel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  And Trump, frankly, does not give a damn about Israel because Trump doesn't care about anyone except for himself. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=153.52s)]
*  It just so happens that what's good for Trump individually in this case is to one-up Biden on anti-Palestinian policies. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=158.72s)]
*  We've seen it before. Everybody has always said that American policy has been terrible in Israel for decades. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=165.84s)]
*  Bipartisan. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=171.2s)]
*  And Trump came along and figured out a way because the rabid base that exists within the Republican Party right now [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=172.0s)]
*  buys into this rhetoric that the Democrats are too soft in Israel and need to support them harder. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump figured out a way to be even more anti-Palestinian through the things that you've ran through in your intro to the segment. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=183.68s)]
*  And you also see the fact that Biden's own assessment is that this is actually what Netanyahu wants. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=189.68s)]
*  That Netanyahu is trying to make things worse in the Middle East in order to help Trump gain that election. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=197.36s)]
*  And it's, you know... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=202.8s)]
*  Which is insane that he continues to support Netanyahu because if he truly believes that Netanyahu wants Trump and he supports Netanyahu, then Biden's supporting Trump. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=211.76s)]
*  That's the logic of that position. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  He's undermining his own candor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=213.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=214.32s)]
*  And Harris's inability to break from Biden and Netanyahu is also insane. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=214.48s)]
*  Their policy of supporting everything that Netanyahu does is morally depraved and it is equally strategically nonsensical and politically stupid. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=217.6s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=224.56s)]
*  It's just incredible. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=224.95999999999998s)]
*  It's interesting what you said that all American presidents have been horrible on Palestine to differing degrees, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=225.44s)]
*  whether it's George Bush, whether it's Bill Clinton, whether it's Barack Obama. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=229.84s)]
*  But as you pointed out, Trump comes in and makes it even worse, right? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=234.79999999999998s)]
*  He moves the embassy, something people have wanted to do for years but never did. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=237.6s)]
*  He did it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  Signing off on the Golan Heights, which Americans have basically de facto recognized the anti-fascist movement, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=242.0s)]
*  but he did it publicly, legally and got a settlement named after him in the process. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=246.16s)]
*  We've erased all that, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=250.48s)]
*  This country has crazy amnesia, even on the left. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=251.76s)]
*  We're talking about Trump becoming president now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=255.27999999999997s)]
*  I see people on Twitter telling me, well, Harris and Biden are doing it for real. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=257.36s)]
*  What you say about Trump is a hypothetical, as if he's never been president before, as if there's not a record that we can judge him on, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=261.84s)]
*  as if he doesn't have people around him, like Kushner and Friedman and Greenblatt and multiple other people. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=268.4s)]
*  Yeah, again, he's said it and he's done it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=273.52s)]
*  He's said that he's going to one-up Biden in being more anti-Palestinian. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=276.0s)]
*  He's demonstrated that before and he's saying that he's going to do it again. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=279.92s)]
*  And talking about his personal political incentives, too, when you talk about the people around him, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=283.04s)]
*  David Friedman, the person who was his ambassador to Israel under his presidency, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=287.52s)]
*  I mean, it's just, you know, his lawyer, it's just, it's putting people around him in charge of policy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=291.6s)]
*  And David Friedman is a religious fanatic by any measure of the imagination. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=295.68s)]
*  He posed in front of a picture in Jerusalem that does not have the Al Aqsa Mosque or the Golden Dome of the Rock, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  but replaced by a Jewish temple put on there. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  This is the ideology that the people who are going to be in charge of policy bring to the table under a president. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=307.68s)]
*  He's just written a book saying never there should ever be a Palestinian state. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=312.24s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So they're all open about what they would like to do. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=315.12s)]
*  But there's no discussion of it. I spend a lot of time on social media, as do you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=318.48s)]
*  I don't see people talk about David Friedman or Jared Kushner or Miriam Adelson or Jason Greenblatt [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=322.4s)]
*  or General Michael Flynn, another messianic person who wants to bomb Iran. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=327.44s)]
*  Just I don't see this discussion, even though the polls are telling us it's 50-50. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=331.52s)]
*  It could be Harris or Trump. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=335.36s)]
*  But we have an endless discussion about how bad Harris's foreign policy is, as we should, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=336.96s)]
*  and we've done it on this show, but zero discussion of what's coming down the track [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=341.36s)]
*  if, as the polls are to be believed, Donald Trump wins on November the 5th. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=345.28s)]
*  And in a way, it's understandable. It's difficult to watch what we are watching day in and day out [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=349.12s)]
*  and to start thinking about speculatively how much worse things could get. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=354.32s)]
*  It is genuinely difficult for people to imagine watching. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=357.52s)]
*  We're literally watching people burning to death, left and right, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=359.92s)]
*  and people being ethnically cleansed and mass murdered. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=362.96s)]
*  It's hard to imagine something worse. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=365.04s)]
*  It is difficult to imagine, and yet that is precisely what Trump is actually... [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=366.24s)]
*  Well, somebody said to me recently on social media, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=369.92s)]
*  what's worse than 42,000 dead? And I said, I don't know, 100,000, 200,000, 300,000. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=371.6s)]
*  The idea that the death toll can't go up is insane. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=376.56s)]
*  Also, we talk about a genocide in Gaza. West Bank has not been technically genocided yet, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=379.12s)]
*  but that could happen with Miriam Adelson's encouragement. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=384.16s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen on the Iran front. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  I just wish we could be more honest about the choice ahead of us. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  They're both bad. I think you and I could agree on that, and a lot of people watching are. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  But we're only looking at the consequences of voting for one. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=396.72s)]
*  For me, January 20th, 2025 is when a new president comes into office. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=399.36s)]
*  I worry that we're not thinking long and hard enough about what happens to the Palestinians [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=403.68s)]
*  on January 21st, 22nd, 23rd. What do you think a Jared Kushner is going to do when he's [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  reappointed to run Middle East policy for Donald Trump? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=415.04s)]
*  Yeah, honestly, even beyond Jared Kushner, what I imagine happens as soon as Trump is president, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=417.6s)]
*  the sheer chaos that he brings to the news cycle means Gaza is buried entirely. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=422.24s)]
*  And we've seen that, by the way, by precedent when Barack Obama was elected. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=428.48s)]
*  Israel immediately took the eve of Barack Obama's election to initiate hostilities in Gaza back in 2008. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=433.12s)]
*  And yeah, and you can very easily imagine that they're going to see the spectacle of Trump presidency [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=438.79999999999995s)]
*  along with the endless, you know, controversies he's going to manufacture out of thin air, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=444.0s)]
*  being a way to bury what's happening in Palestine beneath the surface and having [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=448.56s)]
*  even get less attention in mainstream media than it's already getting. And that spells out horrors. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=451.84s)]
*  Then you have whatever finished the job actually looks like and what it means in practice. And that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=456.88s)]
*  could be the significant escalation and flat out endorsement from the White House of Israel taking [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=460.72s)]
*  over all of North Gaza and pushing Palestinians completely out of it. And beginning that process [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  in the West Bank as well and saying that we recognize, you know, Trump already recognized [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=471.12s)]
*  the legitimacy of Israeli settlements and what that expansion looks like. It could be a horror [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=474.88000000000005s)]
*  that ends up looking a little bit similar to Gaza. And the last thing I want to just add to that is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  what happens domestically, because I think one of the biggest threats that Israel sees, yes, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=483.44000000000005s)]
*  they have regional rivals, they have all kinds of stuff, but they see the changing sales in [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=488.72s)]
*  American public opinion. And that's what really worries them is the fact that it's clear that the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=493.92s)]
*  next generation of Americans is going to shift American policy in a meaningful direction because [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  they're not down with supporting Israel no matter what they do. And they want to see an end to the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=502.0s)]
*  slaughter and they want to see U.S. military funding conditioned for Israel. And so the repression [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  that Trump is promising domestically, I think is going to be a big part of it because [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=511.12s)]
*  there's some history there that I don't think a lot of people know about the fact that Israel [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=515.76s)]
*  has been trying to conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism for a long time. And there was [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=519.6s)]
*  an effort under the Obama administration in the form of the Anti-Semitism Awareness Act legislatively [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  to try to impose a definition of anti-Semitism domestically that conflates these things. And [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=529.5200000000001s)]
*  the civil rights community stood against it. Even big organizations like the ACLU put their foot down [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=534.32s)]
*  and said this would harm free speech. And when Trump came in, he just passed that as an executive [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=538.48s)]
*  order. And he put a guy who used to be in charge of harassing students on college campuses and [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=544.08s)]
*  manufacturing controversies about anybody being critical of Israel somehow being engaged in [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=550.64s)]
*  anti-Semitic behavior. Trump brought that person up from being the opponent of the civil rights [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=554.72s)]
*  body at the Department of Education and put him in charge of that body. Marcus, right? Yes, it was [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=560.96s)]
*  Ken Marcus. And so you're looking at a level of domestic repression that really puts our internal [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=564.4000000000001s)]
*  trajectory really at risk. I'm glad you gave that context because a lot of this stuff is either not [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=570.08s)]
*  known or quickly forgotten. And it's really important because, you know, it's an interesting [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=573.84s)]
*  point you made about pushing Palestine and Gaza off the media coverage. Someone tweeted recently, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=578.08s)]
*  if you elect Trump, if you elect Harris, you have one fire Gaza and you fight that one fire. With [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=582.96s)]
*  Trump, you have 100 fires. So you have to spread yourself to fight multiple of them, which I thought [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=588.32s)]
*  was an interesting way of putting it. What would you say to someone who says, but hold on Omar, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  if Trump is elected and backs Bibi, what you'll see is he's so unpopular and so toxic that everyone [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=597.76s)]
*  will turn against Israel. You'll have liberals and Democrats who wouldn't go against Biden and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=603.28s)]
*  Harris, but they will go against Trump. You'll have way more members of Congress who are Democrats [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=607.1999999999999s)]
*  willing to call it out because now it's a Trump-Bibi war. Yeah, I think that frankly that is correct. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=610.72s)]
*  So there is that sliver of benefit that could come with that. And that finally, when you look at the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=615.68s)]
*  way corporate media in America, they respond to things in the way that the Democratic establishment, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=620.16s)]
*  you will see more significant opposition. But I'm not sure that that's adequate opposition to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=624.0s)]
*  actually make a shift in policy. Well, as you saw before. Yes, in terms of the immediate aftermath [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=628.4s)]
*  of that, you are building long-term opposition, but in terms of the immediate impact of what people [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=632.88s)]
*  on the ground are actually living through, I only see a path of escalation for that. That's only [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=637.92s)]
*  going to get worse. And look, it's a difficult thing with elections and I'm not going to pretend [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=641.6s)]
*  this is easy. I viscerally cannot bring myself to vote for the people who have unfolded the horror [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=645.84s)]
*  that we've seen over the past year, but I'm not going to pretend that this is part of a coherent [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=650.96s)]
*  strategy about making things better for people who are there. We are stuck between a rock and a hard [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=655.6s)]
*  place and an incredibly ugly and distasteful decision when it comes to this in the upcoming [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  election. There are no good options for Palestinians on the table. There's bigger considerations that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  people can take into account. One last question then to go broadly beyond Palestinians. You said [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  earlier about regional rivals and you mentioned what might happen in the West Bank. What does [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=672.96s)]
*  the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Jordan, all these folks, Egypt do if Trump comes in and [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=677.76s)]
*  escalates and we see the genocide spread, we see actual ethnic cleansing across all of the occupied [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=683.2s)]
*  territories? I was just speaking to Congressman Ro Khanna earlier who came back from meeting King [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=688.48s)]
*  Abdullah. He met the Saudis, he said, even the Saudis said, we didn't really care that much about [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=692.0s)]
*  the Palestinians pre-October 7 but now we have to. What happens do you think there with the regional [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=695.76s)]
*  implications? I mean there are a lot of countries including Saudi Arabia who are eager to normalise [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=700.4s)]
*  relations with Israel. They want to be part of the US camp and kind of like isolate Iran more [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=704.4s)]
*  and this is really a thorn in their side. This idea that the issue of Palestine, the glaring [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=709.84s)]
*  injustice and brutality of Israel towards Palestinians is just too much for them to be [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=715.12s)]
*  able to publicly come out and support it and they want to see a resolution. Now frankly I don't think [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=719.04s)]
*  they care in one direction or the other, right? It's either complete and total Israeli victory over [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=723.6s)]
*  all of its rivals and then everything is fine or it's the US pressuring Israel to come to some sort [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=727.44s)]
*  of reasonable accommodation with Palestinians. What they don't want is this path of endless [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=732.0s)]
*  escalation that we're currently on because if Israel is under the impression that they can just [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=735.92s)]
*  pummel Palestinians into submission within the foreseeable future, I mean how much, how many times [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=739.76s)]
*  are you going to try that over and over again and understand that this is not going to lead to [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=744.96s)]
*  anything good? We are setting ourselves on the path of disaster. We are allowing utter lunatics in [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=747.6s)]
*  Tel Aviv-run policy in a way that is just completely insane and the fact that we have not had the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  backbone to put a stop to it and to say enough is enough, this is driving the entire region to the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  cliff, not just for the people who are experiencing it directly but even for American interests in the [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=761.36s)]
*  region is utterly insane and I'm worried that darker days are actually still ahead of us to come. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=765.6s)]
*  We can agree on that. Omar Bada, thank you so much for your time, I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=770.88s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOvcGf3S7yM&t=774.16s)]
