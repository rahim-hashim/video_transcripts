# Trump's Assassination Attempt; Banning the Word ‘Zionist’; The Terrorizing of Haitian Immigrants
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0)
*  Welcome to Mehdi Unfiltered here in Washington, D.C. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Mehdi Hassan. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2.84s)]
*  On today's show, I'll talk with actress and activist [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=3.84s)]
*  Cynthia Nixon about the latest attempts by universities [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=6.24s)]
*  to suppress pro-Palestine protests. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=9.24s)]
*  Also on the show, why Trump's racist lie [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=11.88s)]
*  about Haitian immigrants eating pets [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  is not only dangerous and false, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=16.72s)]
*  but is also a form of domestic terrorism. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=19.12s)]
*  But first, I speak with Maxwell Frost, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=21.52s)]
*  Congress's first Gen Z member, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=23.76s)]
*  about the latest assassination attempt on Trump. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=26.12s)]
*  So, what are we waiting for? Let's go. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Another weekend, another assassination attempt [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=38.0s)]
*  on former President Trump, another alleged shooter [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  who isn't just a former Republican voter. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=43.0s)]
*  He claims to have voted for Trump in 2016, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=44.839999999999996s)]
*  but has also been tied to the Democrats, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=47.4s)]
*  and who also seems to have serious mental health issues. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=50.08s)]
*  And yet, he had access to a firearm, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=53.32s)]
*  an AK-47-type rifle, we're told. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=55.28s)]
*  The Republicans are outraged that Trump has been the victim [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=57.76s)]
*  of two assassination attempts by men with guns, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=60.16s)]
*  but they're never outraged about all the men with guns [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=63.0s)]
*  who shoot up schools and grocery stores and movie theaters [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=65.4s)]
*  and churches and synagogues. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=68.4s)]
*  That they're fine with. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=70.24s)]
*  Well, someone who isn't is Maxwell Alejandro Frost, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=72.12s)]
*  the first member of Gen Z to be elected to Congress [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=75.44s)]
*  from Florida, and former national organizing director [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=78.92s)]
*  for March for Our Lives, the youth-led movement [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=82.0s)]
*  in support of gun control. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=84.4s)]
*  You might recognize Congressman Frost from the standing ovation [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=86.28s)]
*  and the loud applause he got at the DNC for his speech last month. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=89.56s)]
*  And Congressman Maxwell Frost joins me now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=93.72s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on Mayday Unfiltered. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me on. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=97.28s)]
*  So, we've got to start with the big news of the week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=98.48s)]
*  What is your reaction to this latest, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=100.4s)]
*  this second Trump assassination attempt [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=102.08s)]
*  in your state of Florida? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=103.92s)]
*  Well, obviously, you know, I'm against any kind of... [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  any form of political violence, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=108.76s)]
*  but the thing I think we really need to talk about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  is people often want to talk about rhetoric, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=112.16s)]
*  which is really important. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=113.92s)]
*  You know, I'm all for toning down rhetoric and everything. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=115.28s)]
*  But the other thing we have to look at is, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=117.72s)]
*  how do we get rid of the means of political violence? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=119.64s)]
*  The fact that people have unfettered access to assault weapons. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=122.44s)]
*  I mean, I think this guy had an AK-47 or something like that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=125.04s)]
*  And what are we going to do to make sure people don't have the means [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=127.84s)]
*  to do political violence in this country? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=130.12s)]
*  I think it's a really important part of the conversation [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=132.04s)]
*  that folks don't want to talk about. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=134.24s)]
*  The second thing is, I know Trump is out here blaming people, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=135.76s)]
*  blaming the vice president for these attempts on his life. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=138.76s)]
*  And the enemy within he's talking about. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=142.32s)]
*  He's really ratcheting down the record. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=143.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, right, yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=145.32s)]
*  When he is the one that has been pushing this to really high levels, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=146.48s)]
*  I mean, just look at what him and JD Vance are pushing about, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=149.12s)]
*  Haitian-Americans, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  that has led to bomb threats at elementary schools. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=153.2s)]
*  Right? I mean, there are Haitian-American parents [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  who are saying they're scared this and their kids at the school [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=159.24s)]
*  because they're being bullied, their lives are being threatened. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=161.76s)]
*  And so, I'm all for talking about tone, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=164.24s)]
*  but some people need to look into the mirror. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=166.68s)]
*  And the second thing is, we need to pass laws to make sure [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=168.48000000000002s)]
*  that people can't get unfettered access to guns in this country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=170.8s)]
*  On that note, I mean, this alleged shooter, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=174.6s)]
*  who from his social media seems to be nuts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=176.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, apparently he's voted for Biden, he's voted for Trump, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  he wanted Vivek Ramaswamy, he's wanted a lot of different people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=180.64s)]
*  A little bit unhinged. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=183.32s)]
*  How do they have such easy access, not just to firearms, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=184.88s)]
*  not just to a handgun, but, as you say, an AK-47-style assault rifle? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, it has to do with our laws. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=191.84s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if this guy's a citizen of Florida, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=193.2s)]
*  if he's a resident of Florida, but Florida's some of the worst... [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=195.48s)]
*  He also has a criminal record. He also had a criminal record. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=198.0s)]
*  Criminal record. You know, the other thing, too, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=200.2s)]
*  is that the US has been pushing and pushing and pushing the water down [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  the gun laws that we did have in the state of Florida. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=205.28s)]
*  You know, now we have permitless carry, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=207.48s)]
*  I mean, where you can just carry a gun [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=209.2s)]
*  without having a permit in the state of Florida. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  So, am I surprised with the situation? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=212.72s)]
*  No, because we have things like this happen all the time [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  to regular citizens in the state of Florida. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=217.64s)]
*  When there was a school shooting in Georgia just a few weeks ago, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=219.92s)]
*  you tweeted, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  -"The school year has started, so the school shootings have started." [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  Do you think people here at this point, in this country, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=226.28s)]
*  have just accepted mass shootings as a part of life, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  to quote GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=233.23999999999998s)]
*  I think people are starting to, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  and that's why it is important for leaders and people in this movement [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=238.0s)]
*  to wake people up and shake them and say, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=241.44s)]
*  -"This isn't normal. This isn't a normal thing." [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=243.16s)]
*  No matter what JD Vance says, no matter what Donald Trump says, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=246.0s)]
*  why isn't it normal to look at every other country, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=249.39999999999998s)]
*  every other major country in this world, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=251.92s)]
*  and look at their rates of gun violence? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we're a country that has immense resources. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=256.4s)]
*  Why is this a uniquely American problem? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=259.12s)]
*  Because of our gun laws. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  And what I tell people is, like every other issue, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  this boils down to corporate greed [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=264.28s)]
*  and the fact that the gun lobby wants to sell as many guns as they can sell. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=266.24s)]
*  Any law that means one less gun being sold, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=270.08s)]
*  they will oppose with everything they got. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=272.96s)]
*  But the good news is, and I truly believe this, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=275.47999999999996s)]
*  I think the gun violence prevention movement [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=278.24s)]
*  is much stronger than the gun lobby right now. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=279.96s)]
*  But the way we have changed, if you study social movements, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=282.36s)]
*  is not a lot of power for a short amount of time, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  it's sustained power. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=287.44s)]
*  We've gotten some good things, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=289.92s)]
*  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=291.12s)]
*  White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=292.92s)]
*  we need to continue to sustain, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=294.88s)]
*  so when we do have a democratic trifecta, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=296.8s)]
*  we can say, this is what we do because it's part of the democratic agenda. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=299.16s)]
*  Or when a Republican comes back into office, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=302.48s)]
*  he can't just tear it all down again, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=304.04s)]
*  he could shut down a White House Office of Gun Violence Policy. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=305.36s)]
*  According to the latest reports, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=307.96s)]
*  around 11,600 people in the US have already died due to gun violence in 2024, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=309.32s)]
*  we're in September. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=313.6s)]
*  During the recent presidential debate, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=315.12s)]
*  I said, and I quote, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  Tim Walz and I are both gun owners, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  we're not taking anyone's guns away. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=320.44s)]
*  Some might say it's a pretty stark statement to make [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  just a week after we saw a 14-year-old kill four people in a school. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=324.84s)]
*  Are Democrats unnecessarily defensive on this issue? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  The polls show that most Americans, including most gun owners, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=331.32s)]
*  most Republicans, want background checks, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=333.91999999999996s)]
*  want basic gun prevention measures. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=336.12s)]
*  But Democrats seem to tiptoe around this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  Here's a vice president, presidential candidate saying, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=340.84s)]
*  well, I own a gun, it's not like I'm anti-gun. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=343.4s)]
*  Do we need to do that? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=345.56s)]
*  I think what the vice president's looking to do [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=347.6s)]
*  is really work at expanding our coalition for this election [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=349.24s)]
*  and making sure people can see themselves represented [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=352.04s)]
*  in voting for Kamala Harris. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=354.6s)]
*  So I get what she's doing, and it's the truth. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=356.32s)]
*  My favourite statistic is most NRA members [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=358.12s)]
*  are for universal background checks, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=360.48s)]
*  and I think she's trying to call out to that specific population of people. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=362.4s)]
*  Saying you don't have to not be a gun owner to support... [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=365.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=368.28s)]
*  Sorry, gun owners don't not have to be part of this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=369.28s)]
*  Exactly, and the other thing, too, is, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=370.96s)]
*  Republicans love to put up the straw man that, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=372.56s)]
*  you know, they are, we're going to go door to door, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=374.68s)]
*  we're going to take all your guns, and that's just not... [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=376.68s)]
*  There's not a serious politician on Capitol Hill that's saying... [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=378.8s)]
*  That's introduced a bill to do that or anything like that. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  What we're talking about is common sense, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=384.36s)]
*  and we know these gun laws work, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=386.04s)]
*  because in cities and in states that have good gun laws, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=387.72s)]
*  guess what? You're less likely to get shot. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=390.76000000000005s)]
*  You're more likely to get shot standing in the middle of a road [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  or standing in the middle of a street in Alabama [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=396.04s)]
*  than you are standing in the middle of Times Square in New York City. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=398.28000000000003s)]
*  People in Alabama will never believe you [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=401.44s)]
*  if you don't know that fact that's uncomfortable to them. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=403.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=406.6s)]
*  In June of 2022, you mentioned that President Biden signed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=407.6s)]
*  inter-law, the first major gun safety legislation, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=410.92s)]
*  passed by Congress in nearly 30 years. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=414.6s)]
*  It allows states to pass laws making it easier for groups [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=417.28s)]
*  to petition for the removal of guns from individuals [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=419.88s)]
*  deemed as a threat to themselves or to others, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=421.88s)]
*  expands background checks on young people. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=423.8s)]
*  It's been nearly over two years. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  How effective do you think that bill's been [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=428.88s)]
*  in actually curbing gun violence, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=430.68s)]
*  in the next 30 years for another such bill? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=432.24s)]
*  Hopefully we don't have to wait another 30 years, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=434.12s)]
*  because the Bipartisan Savior Communities Act [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=436.12s)]
*  is a really good step forward, and it is working. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=438.12s)]
*  Like, people should know gun violence has gone down in this country [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=440.44s)]
*  in terms of what we'd call everyday gun violence, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=443.68s)]
*  gun violence that goes down in our urban communities, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=446.03999999999996s)]
*  predominantly black and brown communities. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=448.24s)]
*  I think it's 17% that we've seen of homicides by gun go down. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=450.12s)]
*  And a big reason why is the gun laws associated with it, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=455.15999999999997s)]
*  but also the funding. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=458.28s)]
*  This is the first time this government is seeing the value [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  in funding community violence intervention, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=462.88s)]
*  which are community programs [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=465.08s)]
*  that work at breaking the cycle of violence. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=466.92s)]
*  And this is really important. When I say public safety, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=469.36s)]
*  what's the top thing people think of? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=471.72s)]
*  Policing, right? That's, like, the only thing we think of. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=473.36s)]
*  We need to expand what public safety means, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=475.96000000000004s)]
*  and part of that is funding community-based programs [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=478.32s)]
*  that work outside of the carceral system. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=480.92s)]
*  I mean, if locking people up into gun violence, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=482.84000000000003s)]
*  we'd have zero gun violence in this country, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=485.04s)]
*  because we lock so many people up. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=486.8s)]
*  The second question is, how do we stop this violence [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  before it happens? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=490.44s)]
*  And it's community violence intervention, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=491.44s)]
*  it's gun laws to make sure guns don't get in the wrong hands, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  and the last thing I'd argue is creating a society [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=496.08000000000004s)]
*  where people don't feel the need to use a gun [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=498.44s)]
*  to solve their problems in the first place. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=500.44s)]
*  So, if you want to end gun violence, you have to fight poverty, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=502.24s)]
*  health care for everybody, and all these different things. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=504.56s)]
*  What about the cultural angles? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=506.88s)]
*  How much of the gun violence in this country, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=508.20000000000005s)]
*  the gun ownership, is to do with a rather recent phenomenon? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=509.96000000000004s)]
*  Because the NRA wasn't always like this, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=512.5600000000001s)]
*  but it's become part of the culture wars, right? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=514.2s)]
*  And how much of gun ownership now is less to do with gun safety, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=517.32s)]
*  gun violence, poverty, whatever material conditions, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=520.52s)]
*  and just a kind of fetishizing of guns? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=523.8000000000001s)]
*  You see members of Congress, your colleagues in the public, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  they put out Christmas card pictures of them and their kids [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=527.64s)]
*  holding AR-15s. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=529.64s)]
*  That's a new phenomenon. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=530.64s)]
*  That didn't happen under, I don't know, Reagan or Bush. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  How much of it is just like, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=534.0s)]
*  own the libs, we're going to have guns, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=535.44s)]
*  and it's all part of our fake American identity? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=537.2s)]
*  I mean, I think there is a gun culture in this country [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=539.96s)]
*  that is different, that is unique than other countries, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=543.36s)]
*  I will say. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=545.8s)]
*  And I think the unfortunate thing is that culture, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=546.8s)]
*  combined with a lot of the rhetoric we're seeing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=549.9599999999999s)]
*  from the right wing, creates this kind of person [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=551.8399999999999s)]
*  who becomes radicalized and goes out and kills people. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=554.88s)]
*  We saw it happen in Florida. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  There's a guy who's a Ron DeSantis supporter, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=558.3599999999999s)]
*  went out to hunt black people, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=560.2399999999999s)]
*  went to Jackson State University, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  got turned around by security, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=563.3199999999999s)]
*  went to a Dollar Tree and murdered three people [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=565.0799999999999s)]
*  because he wanted to hunt black people. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=566.92s)]
*  Tree of Life synagogue, right? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=568.76s)]
*  Different situations that we've seen. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=570.4799999999999s)]
*  And so, the culture piece is a really important part, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=572.88s)]
*  but I think sometimes folks will weaponize that and say, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=576.52s)]
*  well, it has to do with the movies or the video game. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=579.08s)]
*  There's movies and video games in these other countries as well. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=581.48s)]
*  But I think there's a specific American gun culture [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  that is deeply connected to the right wing [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  that is something we need to watch out for. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=588.76s)]
*  The weird fetishizing of weapons is very strange to me [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=590.24s)]
*  as an immigrant American. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=592.76s)]
*  The US is a pretty violent country, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=594.44s)]
*  so it's not surprising that when Vance and Trump [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=596.0400000000001s)]
*  told lies about immigrants eating pets, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=597.76s)]
*  Trump doing it on the debate stage [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=600.44s)]
*  in front of tens of millions of people on television. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=601.5999999999999s)]
*  That was followed almost immediately by bomb threats, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=603.7199999999999s)]
*  as you say, against elementary schools, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  against the hospital, against city officials, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  death threats against Haitian families [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=609.88s)]
*  who were keeping their kids home from school. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=611.5999999999999s)]
*  The Haitian community is living in fear right now. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  You yourself are Afro-Latino. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=616.8s)]
*  About one in five residents in your home state of Florida [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=618.68s)]
*  are foreign-born. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=620.8s)]
*  It's obviously an issue close to your heart. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=621.64s)]
*  How extreme is this rhetoric, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=623.4799999999999s)]
*  even by the standards of the GOP that we've seen in recent days? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=625.9599999999999s)]
*  And are Trump and Vance guilty of inciting domestic terrorism [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=629.24s)]
*  in this country? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=632.1999999999999s)]
*  I believe they are. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=633.3199999999999s)]
*  From this and from other things as well, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=634.76s)]
*  I mean, Trump incited an almost insurrection on our capital. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=636.4399999999999s)]
*  I believe that's treasonous. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=641.28s)]
*  But the other thing we have to look at is the fact that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=643.7199999999999s)]
*  these words lead to threats, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=646.8s)]
*  and the threats lead to actual violence. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=648.76s)]
*  I represent one of the largest concentrations [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=650.6s)]
*  of Haitian Americans. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=652.48s)]
*  Actually, my biological father is Haitian as well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  And so I'm part of the national elected of Haitian, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=655.8s)]
*  or the national network of Haitian elected officials. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=658.68s)]
*  And I've seen, I've had people reach out to me, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=660.92s)]
*  municipal leaders saying, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=662.5999999999999s)]
*  they're scared for their own safety [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=663.92s)]
*  as a leader in this country [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=666.2399999999999s)]
*  because of what Trump and Vance are saying. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=667.2399999999999s)]
*  And it's hard for Trump to surprise me [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=668.8399999999999s)]
*  because I think of him so, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  I think he's a horrible person, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=674.4399999999999s)]
*  but he did surprise me when he brought that up on that stage. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=675.64s)]
*  I was not expecting him to bring up that lie [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=679.0s)]
*  on the debate stage, which... [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=681.8s)]
*  Well, he has Laura Lumer advising him. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=683.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=685.0s)]
*  Worse than that, over the weekend, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=686.3599999999999s)]
*  he refused to denounce bomb threats. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=689.2s)]
*  Something that would have been so easy to do. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=690.96s)]
*  And then he doubled down on this horrible lie [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=692.4000000000001s)]
*  that's being told about Haitian Americans. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=694.8800000000001s)]
*  I mean, even the horrible lie, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=696.24s)]
*  he could keep doing the lie and say, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=697.24s)]
*  but I condemn the threats. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=698.6s)]
*  He won't even condemn the bomb threats. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=699.44s)]
*  That's the world we're in right now. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=700.84s)]
*  Let me ask you about the democratic reaction to this. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=702.9200000000001s)]
*  Why aren't top Democrats speaking out [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=704.8000000000001s)]
*  more forcefully on this? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=706.2s)]
*  I saw Joe Biden actually condemn it [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  on camera pretty harshly, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=708.9200000000001s)]
*  but I haven't seen much from Kamala Harris or Tim Walz. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=710.0s)]
*  I just saw someone tweeting, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=712.0400000000001s)]
*  why don't they do a town hall in Springfield [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=713.5600000000001s)]
*  to support Haitian Americans? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=715.6s)]
*  Again, the gun control question. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=717.0400000000001s)]
*  Are Democrats on the defensive again? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=718.44s)]
*  Do they see immigration as a hot button issue? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  We can't touch this, because a major... [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=722.0s)]
*  American city has been locked down for several days. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=724.48s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=727.2800000000001s)]
*  Where are the vice president and Governor Walz? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=728.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=731.0400000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm glad to see the president's statement. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=731.88s)]
*  He put one out very swiftly and quickly. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=733.1600000000001s)]
*  I've spoken with the campaign a little bit [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=735.72s)]
*  about doing something around this [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=737.4000000000001s)]
*  to make sure Haitian Americans feel secure. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=738.88s)]
*  I mean, number one, it's the right thing to do, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=740.52s)]
*  but number two, if we just look at this [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=742.6s)]
*  from a strategic point of view as well, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=744.08s)]
*  there are so many Haitian Americans in the state of Florida [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=746.28s)]
*  where now Kamala Harris is pulling anywhere [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=748.08s)]
*  between three to five points away from Trump. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=750.0s)]
*  And so I think it's important to step in here [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=752.4s)]
*  from both points of view here. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=754.36s)]
*  So you would like to see Harris and Walz say more [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=755.2s)]
*  on this issue and what's been happening? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=757.8s)]
*  I think so. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=758.84s)]
*  I think so, for sure. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=759.6800000000001s)]
*  And we'll see what she comes out with [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=760.6s)]
*  over the next coming days, obviously. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=763.36s)]
*  This is ratcheting up and becoming more of a national problem. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=764.8s)]
*  You could argue that people in Springfield, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=767.24s)]
*  they don't have much time. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=768.32s)]
*  Someone needs to kind of stem this now. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=769.16s)]
*  You dedicated almost all your time on the DNC stage [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=771.36s)]
*  to the climate crisis, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=773.52s)]
*  which is a topic that during election campaigns [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=774.56s)]
*  often falls through the cracks. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=776.8399999999999s)]
*  And Trump obviously sets a pretty low bar. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=778.7199999999999s)]
*  The guy thinks it's a Chinese hoax. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  So to be better than Trump on climate change is not hard. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=782.04s)]
*  But there are some who would argue [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=785.04s)]
*  that Kamala Harris has not said very much on climate change. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=786.2399999999999s)]
*  She hasn't put out a clear climate policy. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=789.16s)]
*  She's obviously part of an administration [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=791.0799999999999s)]
*  which openly brags that they have higher energy [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=792.5999999999999s)]
*  in all production levels than even Trump had. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=795.52s)]
*  I interviewed Jill Stein recently and she said, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=797.52s)]
*  and I said, why would you want Trump to be president? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=800.2399999999999s)]
*  She said, well, look how bad Biden's climate record has been. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=802.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's fair. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=804.88s)]
*  So what do you want to see from the vice president [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=805.9599999999999s)]
*  on the climate crisis? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=808.28s)]
*  Well, first off, I would argue that President Biden [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=809.52s)]
*  does not have a bad climate record. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=811.6s)]
*  I mean, he's done... [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=812.92s)]
*  Record levels of oil production, fracking? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=813.9599999999999s)]
*  Well, I think what the president is looking to do is, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  number one, talk about the fact... [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=818.7199999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of anxiety around the just transition [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=820.04s)]
*  to a green economy. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=823.3199999999999s)]
*  And we got to understand that, right? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=824.4399999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean that we increase oil production. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=826.12s)]
*  I disagree with that part. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=828.4399999999999s)]
*  But I think what he's saying when he talks about this is, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=830.16s)]
*  those jobs are still there, those families are still... [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=833.48s)]
*  Those people are still able to feed their families. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=835.76s)]
*  And we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=837.52s)]
*  the most amount of resources ever dedicated [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=840.16s)]
*  to the climate crisis, not in the history of this country, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=842.16s)]
*  in the history of humanity. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=843.96s)]
*  Both things can be true. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=845.52s)]
*  And I think that when the president talks about [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=847.16s)]
*  increased oil production, I think what he's really trying to do [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=848.88s)]
*  is speak with those families who have anxiety, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=851.12s)]
*  which is valid. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=852.88s)]
*  But what we need to do on our end as leaders [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=854.32s)]
*  is talk about what does a just transition look like. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  But I would disagree with Jill Stein [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=859.5999999999999s)]
*  that he's horrible on the climate. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=861.16s)]
*  I mean, Kamala Harris is the one that cast [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  that tie-breaking vote for the IRA, too. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=866.16s)]
*  So, we like to say that the IRA... [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=868.0s)]
*  When you saw her say on CNN that she now backs fracking, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=869.3599999999999s)]
*  she's U-turned on her position from 2020. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=871.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=873.2399999999999s)]
*  I disagree with fracking. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=874.2399999999999s)]
*  But I think, again, it's part of that anxiety [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=875.64s)]
*  that so many working Americans have [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  around what does a just transition look like. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=880.04s)]
*  And I think we as a party need to do a better job of, of course, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  talk about the new green economy and what that looks like [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=884.9599999999999s)]
*  and how it's going to save our planet and humanity. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=887.52s)]
*  But I think if we're able to tell these families, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=889.52s)]
*  how are you still going to be able to feed your family? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=891.6s)]
*  I'm not 100% sure we as a party have gotten to a place [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=893.88s)]
*  where we're in lockstep talking about that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=897.68s)]
*  And I think the more we delay those conversations, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=900.04s)]
*  the more we'll see people try to, you know, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=902.8s)]
*  speak to those anxieties in a way that we would disagree with. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=905.56s)]
*  Fracking, increased oil production, etc. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=907.84s)]
*  OK, before we finish, you were at the DNC, you spoke on stage. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=909.76s)]
*  I was at the DNC watching from the audience. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=912.8s)]
*  There were people who looked like you. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=914.92s)]
*  I mean, you said, as you are Afro-Latina, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=916.48s)]
*  you're part of two different communities, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=918.6s)]
*  but there were Hispanic Americans, to quote John Stewart, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=920.2s)]
*  black Americans, Jewish Americans, gay Americans. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=922.72s)]
*  Mm-hm. There were no Palestinian Americans. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=925.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, it wasn't just an oversight. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=927.4s)]
*  There was a deliberate decision not to allow state lawmaker Ruhr Roman, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=929.28s)]
*  who the uncommitted movement had put forward, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=933.44s)]
*  a Palestinian American elected Democrat in Georgia, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=935.24s)]
*  crucial swing state, to speak on stage about what's happening in Gaza [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=937.72s)]
*  and also to endorse Kamala Harris on stage, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=941.36s)]
*  which was controversial for her, coming from Palestinian American community [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=943.52s)]
*  who don't really like Kamala right now. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=946.4s)]
*  Was that a mistake? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=948.0s)]
*  I... I disagreed with the decision, and I made a post about it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=950.0s)]
*  The other thing, though, is there's a lot of stuff that happens behind the scenes [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=953.52s)]
*  that a lot of times people don't know about, conversations. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=956.6s)]
*  These events are super highly scripted. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=959.24s)]
*  But I... I called for it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=961.6s)]
*  I think that she should have been allowed to say a few words, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=964.24s)]
*  especially as someone who's endorsing the president. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=967.2s)]
*  She's a strong... I'm all... You know, of course that, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=969.48s)]
*  but also she's from the South. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=972.2s)]
*  I'm always for more southern representation on the DNC stage, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=973.52s)]
*  and so I'm a big fan of her and her work. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=976.4s)]
*  I think she could... But do you recognise the damage? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  Does the party recognise the damage that's been done? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=980.24s)]
*  Because up until that point, Harris had a bit of a honeymoon [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=981.96s)]
*  with a lot of Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, progressives on Gaza. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=984.48s)]
*  She was sounding a bit better than Biden. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=987.84s)]
*  There was a sense of, OK, we've got a change. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=989.4s)]
*  It's not... Joe Biden's not the candidate. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=991.36s)]
*  And then this happened, and I felt... [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=993.36s)]
*  And as someone who's part of the Muslim American community, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=995.32s)]
*  I heard from people saying, well, this is unacceptable. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=997.32s)]
*  This is bad. I mean, there's a lot of repairing that needs to be done, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1000.24s)]
*  and there's a lot of work that needs to be done. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1002.68s)]
*  And I think the vice president's heart is in the right place on this issue, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1004.72s)]
*  and I think she will be a leader that distinguishes herself from... [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  But she hasn't on policy so far. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1012.68s)]
*  She was asked on CNN specifically about changing policy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1014.48s)]
*  She said no. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1016.92s)]
*  She's been asked about conditioning of military aid to Israel, [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  some form of arms embargo, even on offensive weapons. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1021.04s)]
*  Her national security adviser made it very clear on Twitter [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1023.84s)]
*  she does not support that. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1026.84s)]
*  So, without the change of policy, how do we end this war, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1028.36s)]
*  and how do we get people to... [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1031.3999999999999s)]
*  who have ditched the Democrats to come back to the Democrats? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1032.8s)]
*  How do you as a party do that? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1035.04s)]
*  I think, first off, it's continuing conversations, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1036.36s)]
*  continuing to hear from people like the vice president's been doing. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1038.9199999999998s)]
*  I... You know, we all, I think, want the same thing at this point, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1042.0s)]
*  which is a ceasefire safety, hostages being returned home, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1045.9199999999998s)]
*  and there's a disagreement on how we get there... [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1050.1999999999998s)]
*  But can you want to ceasefire while also arming one side of it? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1052.08s)]
*  It's like me telling... You know, it's like me telling my friend at the bar, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1054.9599999999998s)]
*  I'd really like you to stop drinking while I keep buying you drinks. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1057.4399999999998s)]
*  This is what I believe. I think that the pressure we exert on Israel, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1061.0s)]
*  and really on any country, shouldn't come down to change, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1064.0s)]
*  like, impacting the defence of civilians, right? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1066.8s)]
*  That's why I'm for things like Iron Dome, Iron Bean, David Slank. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1069.8s)]
*  I voted against the supplementals, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1073.52s)]
*  one of, like, 30-something people to vote against it, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1075.2s)]
*  because I see a difference between defensive aid and offensive aid, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1077.04s)]
*  and the offensive aid being bombs we see being, you know, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1080.96s)]
*  turned to innocent Palestinians. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1084.32s)]
*  Which is... That's my personal view. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1085.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that with the vice president, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1088.56s)]
*  we have an opportunity to get towards a path towards peace here. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1090.12s)]
*  But the thing people also need to realise, too, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1094.24s)]
*  is she's a sitting vice president to a president. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1096.04s)]
*  She's also running a campaign for president. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1098.76s)]
*  This is a very unique situation that hasn't been seen this way [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1101.2s)]
*  in this kind of rapid deployment, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1105.04s)]
*  and so I think it's important to keep those relationships knowing, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1106.84s)]
*  of course, I'm not going to... But even if we take both parts, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1109.52s)]
*  let's take the Harris campaign and the Biden administration [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1112.04s)]
*  that Harris is part of, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1114.24s)]
*  neither of them refused to even entertain the idea [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  of restrictions on weapons sales to Israel, especially given... [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1119.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, Biden did... [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1122.36s)]
*  For, like, a week or whatever it was. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1123.6799999999998s)]
*  He did it, but, yeah. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1125.3999999999999s)]
*  But, you know, that's a pretty big deal for our country. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1126.6s)]
*  But we're in a blatant... [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1129.08s)]
*  We're in a situation where I think you wouldn't disagree, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1130.32s)]
*  we are in blatant violation of multiple US laws right now, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1132.1999999999998s)]
*  the Foreign Assistance Act, the Leahy law, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  all of which say you cannot be giving weapons [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1136.4799999999998s)]
*  to a country that is blocking aid, that is killing civilians. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1138.1999999999998s)]
*  Just why do you think it is... What would you say to a voter who says, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1141.52s)]
*  why is the Democratic Party not doing this? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1144.2s)]
*  What's the answer? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1146.48s)]
*  I think that we have a lot of work to do on this issue. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1148.0800000000002s)]
*  It's an answer, Congressman. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1150.96s)]
*  I think we have a lot of work to do on this issue. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1152.0s)]
*  But why won't you do it? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1153.76s)]
*  Not you personally, but the party. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1154.96s)]
*  I think, again, like, we as a party [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1156.8400000000001s)]
*  have a long way to go on this issue. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1159.24s)]
*  Just like... Just to make an example of this, too, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1160.72s)]
*  15 years ago, if I said assault weapons ban, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1164.76s)]
*  half of the Democratic caucus in Congress wouldn't be for it. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1167.4s)]
*  Now it's the normal Democratic view. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1169.8000000000002s)]
*  You know why 15 years ago half the caucus wouldn't have been for it? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1171.3200000000002s)]
*  Tim Walz has been open about this. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1174.12s)]
*  They had a lot of support for the NRA. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1175.56s)]
*  We're happy to talk about the gun lobby, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1177.48s)]
*  but AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1178.68s)]
*  doesn't really get a mention in your party. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1179.96s)]
*  But it's lobby groups, it's special interests, it's money, right? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1182.32s)]
*  If we can see it on guns, why can't we see it on foreign policy? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1184.76s)]
*  I think we need to see it on all issues. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1188.08s)]
*  I think we need to end Citizens United. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1189.52s)]
*  I mean, I've been very vocal on it as well. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1191.1599999999999s)]
*  But, you know, this issue, the state of Israel, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1193.6399999999999s)]
*  I represent a lot of Arab Americans [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1196.76s)]
*  and I represent a lot of Jewish Americans, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  and they're all in different places on the ideological spectrum [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1200.44s)]
*  and they're all in a very diverse community. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1203.24s)]
*  But what I've found from spending a lot of time with my Jewish colleagues [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1204.92s)]
*  is for a lot of folks, you know, Israel's more than a state, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1207.16s)]
*  it's like a representation of the existence of their people. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1209.24s)]
*  And then we look at what's going on in Gaza. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1212.44s)]
*  I have constituents that have lost 40, 50 family members at a time. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1214.1200000000001s)]
*  And so there's all this trauma going on, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1217.76s)]
*  and I think that we have a lot of work to do as a party [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1219.8s)]
*  in recognizing the trauma and grief of everyone [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1222.6000000000001s)]
*  in figuring out that path towards peace. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1225.24s)]
*  I'm dedicated towards that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1227.04s)]
*  I think that we as a country should be more aggressive and involved [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1228.6000000000001s)]
*  in getting towards that path towards peace, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1232.6s)]
*  and I think we're getting there. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1234.12s)]
*  We're seeing glimmers of hope. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1235.32s)]
*  And I know people will be like, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  there's so many people dying and each day more people die. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1238.56s)]
*  And I understand that, but we have to keep pushing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1242.8799999999999s)]
*  Quick question on that, sorry. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1244.6799999999998s)]
*  Could you just remind me when you said that about your... [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1245.84s)]
*  Did you get a backlash when you were one of the handful of members [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1247.52s)]
*  of Congress to vote against that supplement? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1250.04s)]
*  Because that's a pretty bold move for a lot of members of Congress. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1252.24s)]
*  You won't do that. When you did that, did you face a backlash? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1254.32s)]
*  I received some backlash, yes. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1257.04s)]
*  I also... [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1258.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm really serious about having relationships with a lot of people, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1260.04s)]
*  even people that disagree with me. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1263.1200000000001s)]
*  The night before that vote, I spent the whole night [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1264.72s)]
*  calling leaders who would disagree with that vote [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1267.0s)]
*  and talking with them. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1269.1200000000001s)]
*  And it helped stem a lot of things after the vote. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1270.52s)]
*  And I've been... I've been protested by folks [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1273.96s)]
*  on many different parts of this issue. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1276.68s)]
*  I would never consider myself somebody in the middle. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1278.48s)]
*  I feel like on this issue, I'm, like, in the middle, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1280.88s)]
*  because I get things from both sides, but I just believe in peace. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1283.48s)]
*  I believe in innocent people not being killed. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1286.04s)]
*  I believe the U.S. should do more. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1287.92s)]
*  One last question. You're the first Gen Z member of Congress. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1290.72s)]
*  What do you think the new generation of politicians [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1293.04s)]
*  will do differently in the future compared to the generations [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1296.4399999999998s)]
*  that have come before you, compared to many of those [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1300.0s)]
*  who now sit in seats right now, decades on end? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1302.8799999999999s)]
*  My hope is that, number one, and taking a step back, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1306.56s)]
*  my hope is the people who run for office... [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1310.48s)]
*  I have a lot of young people who come up to me and say, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1312.9199999999998s)]
*  I want to run for office, and I think I always tell them, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1314.84s)]
*  is that's great. It seems to give a lot of ambition. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1316.6s)]
*  This institution is full of a lot of people [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1319.12s)]
*  that have a lot of ambition and no passion. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1321.0s)]
*  And so just think about why you want to run. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1323.76s)]
*  If you can't answer the question, it might not be time. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1326.1999999999998s)]
*  Or if it's to be the second Gen Z member, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1328.52s)]
*  that's not a good reason, right? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1330.9199999999998s)]
*  Like, why do you want to be in this institution? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1332.56s)]
*  What do you want to do here? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1334.6s)]
*  You got to have the passion and the ambition, too. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1335.9199999999998s)]
*  The... So I hope we'll have, you know, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1338.1999999999998s)]
*  people who have a hard of service coming in here, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1340.6s)]
*  not just a bunch of ambitious people who want to get ahead. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1342.1999999999998s)]
*  The second thing is, and I hope this from both conservatives [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1345.1999999999998s)]
*  and Democrats that come into the institution, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1348.56s)]
*  is that we can look at the operation [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1350.56s)]
*  and we can look at reforms that are needed [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1354.0s)]
*  in terms of the institution very clear-eyed, right? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1356.04s)]
*  Getting rid of Citizens United, making it easier to run for office. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1359.1599999999999s)]
*  It shouldn't be easy, but it shouldn't be damn near impossible. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1362.32s)]
*  It was really hard during my journey. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1364.84s)]
*  You know a lot about that as well. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1366.96s)]
*  We need to change the way Congress works. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1369.28s)]
*  We need to get rid of the filibuster in the Senate. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1371.24s)]
*  There's a lot of institutional things that we need to undo. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1373.6s)]
*  That's part of why Project 2025 is frightening and angers me, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1376.76s)]
*  because what they're looking to do is continue building [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1380.64s)]
*  on these Jim Crow relics to make it harder [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1383.52s)]
*  to make progress in this country. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1386.04s)]
*  This is a left-of-center country, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1387.52s)]
*  If everyone voted every election, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1389.52s)]
*  I honestly do believe a Democrat or a left-of-center person [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1391.72s)]
*  or a progressive would be elected a president, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1394.8s)]
*  and we'd see different laws. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1396.52s)]
*  But what happened during Jim Crow [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1397.96s)]
*  and what happened in this country is the right wing [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1399.48s)]
*  has found ways to change the system, little by little, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1401.5600000000002s)]
*  and they've found things that are almost impossible to undo. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1405.1599999999999s)]
*  So that way, not only are we fighting for votes, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1408.04s)]
*  but we're fighting a system here. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1409.9599999999998s)]
*  We're literally fighting a system. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1411.36s)]
*  Look at the Electoral College. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1412.52s)]
*  Look at what that benefits, right? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1414.04s)]
*  Same thing with the filibuster. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1415.84s)]
*  So my hope, obviously, I hope we do stuff on climate [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1417.32s)]
*  and gun violence and all these, but taking a step back [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1420.4399999999998s)]
*  and being in this institution for two years, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1422.7199999999998s)]
*  I can tell you the glaring thing for me is we got a lot [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1425.52s)]
*  of things to change in terms of the way this place works. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1428.52s)]
*  Because if we don't do that, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1432.32s)]
*  there's always going to be a few steps forward, a few steps back. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1433.92s)]
*  And that's my greatest revelation being here. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1436.8000000000002s)]
*  And the thing that gives me hope is I've met a lot [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1439.5600000000002s)]
*  of conservative young people who agree, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  who want to make sure that members of Congress [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1444.4s)]
*  can't buy in trade stock, right? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1446.8400000000001s)]
*  Who want to make sure that we get rid of Citizens United. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1448.96s)]
*  So there might be some bipartisan support here, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1451.68s)]
*  not on all of it, but on some of these reforms, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1453.88s)]
*  what we needed, or else big corporations, billionaire power, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1456.2s)]
*  it's just always going to run the table. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1459.7600000000002s)]
*  Well said. Congressman Maxwell Frost, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1461.8400000000001s)]
*  thank you so much for your time. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1463.48s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thanks. Appreciate it. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1464.88s)]
*  Thanks for coming on the show. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1466.44s)]
*  College students are back on campus [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1467.6000000000001s)]
*  for a new school year here in the U.S., [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1469.6000000000001s)]
*  and college administrators aren't taking any chances [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1471.6000000000001s)]
*  when it comes to pro-Palestine protests. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  They're cracking down preemptively [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1476.04s)]
*  at the well-known Barnard College, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1478.48s)]
*  which is affiliated with Columbia University in New York, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1480.0800000000002s)]
*  and which, like Columbia, was the scene of a great deal [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1482.68s)]
*  of protest and crackdowns earlier this year. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1484.88s)]
*  They've amended their community conduct guidelines. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1487.3200000000002s)]
*  Some of the striking changes include clauses that they say [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1490.4s)]
*  are a violation of the college's commitment [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1493.0s)]
*  to institutional neutrality, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1494.92s)]
*  such as messaging from the president [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1496.76s)]
*  or from any division or department of the college [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1498.76s)]
*  supporting a geopolitical viewpoint or perspective, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1500.96s)]
*  while denigrating or remaining silent [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1503.76s)]
*  about an opposing geopolitical viewpoint or perspective. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1505.96s)]
*  Employees posting signs on their office doors [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1509.16s)]
*  supporting a geopolitical viewpoint or perspective. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1511.48s)]
*  That's a no-no, too. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1514.24s)]
*  So, free speech? Don't be silly. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1515.44s)]
*  In fact, the hate speech definition at Barnard, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1518.24s)]
*  like at NYU and some other colleges, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1520.24s)]
*  is also being expanded to include Zionism, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1522.32s)]
*  which is a political ideology, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1525.32s)]
*  not a protected racial or religious class. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1526.8s)]
*  Substituting the word Zionist for Jewish or Israeli, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1529.52s)]
*  for example, may constitute prohibited discrimination [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1532.52s)]
*  or harassment against those of Jewish or Israeli origin, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1535.36s)]
*  it says. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1538.52s)]
*  So, what to make of these linguistic crackdowns [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1539.52s)]
*  which accompany the predictable police crackdowns? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1542.24s)]
*  Joining me now is activist and award-winning actress [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1545.44s)]
*  Cynthia Nixon, who is a Zateo contributor [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1547.76s)]
*  and alumnus of Barnard College. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1550.3999999999999s)]
*  Cynthia, thanks so much for coming back on May the Unfiltered. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1551.9199999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Maddie. Great to be here. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1554.72s)]
*  Um, we discussed Barnard and college protests [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1556.6s)]
*  earlier this year and the crackdowns from on high. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1559.52s)]
*  Six months later, and a new academic year later, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1562.72s)]
*  things seem to be getting worse, more draconian, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1565.72s)]
*  more authoritarian, not better. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1567.9199999999998s)]
*  Students have reported to have been suspended [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1570.2s)]
*  from the fall semester already. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1572.04s)]
*  Are you following what is going on at your old college? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1573.84s)]
*  Yes, I'm doing the best to. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1577.2s)]
*  It's all unfolding so quickly. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1578.72s)]
*  And it's really devastating to see such a betrayal [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1580.92s)]
*  of Barnard's values and Barnard's history [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1586.32s)]
*  and Barnard's legacy. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1589.72s)]
*  You know, the charges against students were certainly... [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1591.32s)]
*  Columbia and Barnard were dropped by the NYPD. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1596.0s)]
*  Columbia has dropped all charges. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1600.12s)]
*  And Barnard is right there with a kind of a breathtaking, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1602.2s)]
*  viciousness, suspending students. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1606.6s)]
*  And in a few cases, you know, students were waiting all summer [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1609.52s)]
*  to understand what was going to happen to them. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1614.1999999999998s)]
*  And the college waited until they had actually paid their tuition [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1616.8s)]
*  and checked in and, you know, moved in and started classes [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1621.0s)]
*  to then announce that they were suspended. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1627.1999999999998s)]
*  And they lost, you know, not only did they lose the right [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1630.12s)]
*  to go to classes, but they actually lost where they lived [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1634.12s)]
*  and they lost their meal plan and they lost their access [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1637.32s)]
*  to health services, including mental health services. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1641.32s)]
*  And this new policy, Cynthia, which says academics on campus [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1645.12s)]
*  can't support a geopolitical viewpoint [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1648.12s)]
*  while remaining silent on an opposing geopolitical view... [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1650.7199999999998s)]
*  But does that mean that professors now have to talk [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1654.32s)]
*  about both sides of the Holocaust [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1656.9199999999998s)]
*  or both sides of the Rwandan genocide or the slave trade? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1659.12s)]
*  Seems kind of crazy to me. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1662.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, it does seem kind of crazy [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1664.32s)]
*  and it seems like the Wild West. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1667.7199999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think everyone is grappling [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1669.32s)]
*  to understand what this means. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1671.7199999999998s)]
*  And yes, so at Barnard, you're not even allowed to have [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1673.32s)]
*  any kind of a decoration on your dorm room. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1676.9199999999998s)]
*  You're not allowed to have a Hello Kitty sticker. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1681.12s)]
*  You're not allowed to have a pride flag. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1682.9199999999998s)]
*  You're not allowed to have anything like that. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1685.32s)]
*  And yes, it seems that professors are not... [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1688.92s)]
*  You know, when after the bombings happened [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1693.92s)]
*  and after the bombardment started in Gaza, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1696.92s)]
*  like for example, there was a department at Barnard, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1700.72s)]
*  the Women's Gender and Sexuality Department [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  that issued a solidarity statement with Palestine. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1707.52s)]
*  And that was taken down and it was banned. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1713.72s)]
*  It was said that no one could offer any kind of a political [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1717.12s)]
*  comment on anything that happened. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1720.32s)]
*  And what was ironic was when it was taken down [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1721.9199999999998s)]
*  without any notification, just the government, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1725.12s)]
*  the administration came in and did it. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1727.52s)]
*  Then the Black Lives Matter post that had been there [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1730.7199999999998s)]
*  four years ago came up, which is obviously of the same ilk. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1733.12s)]
*  It's a complete reversal when Roe versus Wade was struck down. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1738.52s)]
*  Barnard, you know, rushed in there and said, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1743.52s)]
*  we will have Plan B available everywhere [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1746.32s)]
*  and including in vending machines and abortion will be covered [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1748.72s)]
*  by our health insurance. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1752.12s)]
*  I mean, this is obviously a tremendous reversal of, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1754.32s)]
*  you know, to say that professors and students cannot respond [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1759.32s)]
*  to current events seems the antithesis [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1762.52s)]
*  of what you want a college to be doing. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1766.52s)]
*  And as you've just highlighted so well, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1768.12s)]
*  when it is other political issues, they're fine with it. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1769.9199999999998s)]
*  It does seem to be about the content of the speech here, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1772.52s)]
*  not about speech itself. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1775.32s)]
*  It's because it's speech about this contentious issue [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1776.52s)]
*  of Israel, occupation, Gaza, genocide, Palestine. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1779.72s)]
*  And of course, Zionism. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1784.9199999999998s)]
*  Last time we spoke, you mentioned how your son is Jewish [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1786.12s)]
*  and how he's very critical of what Israel's doing in Gaza. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1789.52s)]
*  There are a lot of anti-Zionist Jews, Cynthia, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1792.52s)]
*  like one of our Zetero contributors, Naomi Klein, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1794.9199999999998s)]
*  famous activist and author. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1797.32s)]
*  And yet Barnard, NYU, a lot of other schools have taken [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1799.32s)]
*  the blame upon themselves to basically conflate Zionism [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  and Judaism and put a political ideology beyond criticism [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1806.72s)]
*  on campus. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1810.52s)]
*  Yes. I mean, it's... [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1812.52s)]
*  One doesn't... [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1814.92s)]
*  One can be Jewish, like my son, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1816.3200000000002s)]
*  and like many of the students protesting at Barnard [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1818.92s)]
*  and Columbia, and still want to speak out [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1821.72s)]
*  about the mass killing of civilians. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1824.72s)]
*  You can be anti-Zionist. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1827.72s)]
*  You don't have to be anti-Zionist to say, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1829.1200000000001s)]
*  this mass killing of civilians is wrong and must stop [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1832.12s)]
*  if we ever want there to be a password piece, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1835.32s)]
*  if we ever want to see the release of the hostages. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1837.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1841.7199999999998s)]
*  And Cynthia, we've heard so much from the right. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1842.52s)]
*  I know you have over the years as someone who's both [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1844.12s)]
*  a political activist and obviously in Hollywood, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1846.32s)]
*  which takes a lot of a beating from the right, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1848.52s)]
*  about cancel culture and no free speech on campuses [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1850.32s)]
*  and snowflakes. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1854.9199999999998s)]
*  But the people who get most canceled [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1856.52s)]
*  and have their free speech most restricted, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1858.52s)]
*  as we're seeing again, are Palestinians [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1860.52s)]
*  and supporters of Palestinian rights. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1862.92s)]
*  They're the ones who are targeted time and again. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1864.32s)]
*  Yes. I mean, I think it's really important to note [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1867.12s)]
*  that the students that have suspended, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1869.72s)]
*  have been suspended and are awaiting to know [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1872.72s)]
*  what their fate is going to be. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1875.32s)]
*  They're overwhelmingly LGBTQ. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1877.52s)]
*  They're overwhelmingly first-generation Americans. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1881.32s)]
*  They're low-income. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1885.72s)]
*  They're the first people in their families to attend college. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1887.12s)]
*  They're a particularly vulnerable population [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1892.32s)]
*  and it does seem like the administration [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1896.12s)]
*  has particularly targeted them. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1898.52s)]
*  It's been very haphazard based on blurry surveillance photos [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1900.12s)]
*  and just people swiping in showing that they were on campus [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1905.9199999999998s)]
*  at the time, not necessarily that they were a protest [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1909.12s)]
*  and many cases in which a queer student of color [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1911.7199999999998s)]
*  was suspended and white straight students [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1915.92s)]
*  that were at their side, nothing happened to them. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1920.1200000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Democrats, when we talk about Gaza, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1925.1200000000001s)]
*  are not changing course on Gaza. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1927.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris has been rhetorically better [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1929.92s)]
*  than Joe Biden, sure, but no change on imposing a ceasefire [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1931.92s)]
*  or bringing in an arms embargo, no end to the genocide in sight. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1936.1200000000001s)]
*  That's more than disappointing, I think you could agree, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1940.3200000000002s)]
*  when it comes to the new Democratic presidential candidate. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1942.1200000000001s)]
*  Yes, I mean, let's be clear. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1944.92s)]
*  I'm very, very happy that Kamala Harris is a candidate. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1946.92s)]
*  Same. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1951.72s)]
*  You know, as a long-time abortion rights activist [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1952.92s)]
*  since I was a teenager, as a person who cares deeply [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1956.52s)]

*  I have no illusions about how disastrous [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1972.92s)]

*  You know, the president needs to do better. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1987.52s)]
*  The idea that, you know, an American, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1989.52s)]
*  a young American activist was shot in the head by the IDF [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=1994.1200000000001s)]

*  and he has hamstrung her a bit, but she can go around him. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2000.92s)]
*  I think when we saw what Biden did when Obama was president [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2003.92s)]
*  and he went around him on the LGBT marriage issue, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2009.72s)]
*  it's like she can do the same thing, and she needs to. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2014.52s)]

*  the vast majority of Americans want to see fire [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2022.1200000000001s)]
*  and a return of the hostages, and she's got to put some space [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2024.72s)]
*  between herself and the president on this. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2030.12s)]

*  Last question to you, Cindy. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2042.32s)]
*  You ran as a progressive for governor of New York, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2043.32s)]

*  Maya Wiley ran as a progressive in the New York mayoral election, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2049.3199999999997s)]
*  in the primary, lost to Eric Adams, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2052.52s)]
*  who is now surrounded by scandal and controversy. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2055.12s)]
*  He's been in federal investigations [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2058.12s)]
*  into four different members of his inner circle. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2060.12s)]
*  Does Eric Adams survive this? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2063.12s)]
*  Should he step aside and not run for mayor again? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2065.12s)]
*  What do you make of the Adams mayoralty in your great city? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2067.52s)]
*  Well, I have never been a fan of the Adams mayoralty. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2071.12s)]
*  I think it's been a disaster for New York. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2075.12s)]
*  I think the way he has gutted funding of education, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2077.12s)]
*  of libraries, of social services, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2082.12s)]
*  and of the way he has put more and more money into the police department [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2085.12s)]
*  has been a disaster for New York. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2088.12s)]
*  I think who knows what will happen. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2090.12s)]
*  As you say, more and more investigations, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2093.12s)]
*  more and more resignations of those close to him. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2095.12s)]
*  The good news is we have a lot of people running against him next year, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2099.12s)]
*  and we have ranked choice voting in New York, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2104.12s)]
*  and I think if the progressives are a little more savvy and together [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2108.12s)]
*  and plan better than they did last time, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2113.12s)]
*  I think we could see an exciting new progressive mayor. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2116.12s)]
*  It would be a great relief. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2119.12s)]
*  Although I always worry about lots of people running, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2121.12s)]
*  that's how Donald Trump benefited by splitting all the opposition vote. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2123.12s)]
*  Maybe there should just be one person to take him down. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2126.12s)]
*  But let's see, I'm not a fan of Eric Adams either. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2128.12s)]
*  I find it amazing that he's in this much scandal [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2130.12s)]
*  and still getting away with it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2133.12s)]
*  Cynthia Nixon, always a pleasure to speak with you. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2135.12s)]

*  A pleasure to talk to you, Maddie. Thank you. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2138.12s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2140.12s)]
*  If I have to create stories so that the American media [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2141.12s)]
*  actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2143.12s)]
*  then that's what I'm going to do. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2146.12s)]
*  Those are the words of Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2148.12s)]
*  Donald Trump's 2024 running mate on CNN on Sunday morning. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2150.12s)]
*  He was talking about the stories he's helped create and amplify, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2154.12s)]
*  fake stories about Haitian immigrants in his state in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2158.12s)]
*  which have led to death threats and bomb threats against Springfield schools, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2163.12s)]
*  hospitals, city officials, and of course the city's Haitian population [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2167.12s)]
*  who are living in fear this week. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2171.12s)]
*  It's incitement of violence, of domestic terrorism by both Vance and Trump, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2173.12s)]
*  who claimed on the national televised debate stage [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2178.12s)]
*  that migrants in Springfield are eating your pets. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2180.12s)]
*  I would say shame on them, but it's hard to shame the shameless. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2184.12s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this is journalist Ellie Mistal, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2188.12s)]
*  who is of Haitian descent [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2191.12s)]
*  and is the justice correspondent for The Nation magazine. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2193.12s)]
*  His latest piece for The Nation is headlined [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2197.12s)]
*  White People Have Never Forgiven Haitians for Claiming Their Freedom. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2200.12s)]
*  Ellie, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2204.12s)]
*  Unpack the argument in your piece. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2206.12s)]
*  This is more than just anti-immigrant sentiment. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2209.12s)]
*  This is also about white supremacists targeting Haitians specifically. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2212.12s)]
*  Yeah, sac-pass-sai, Mendy. Nice to be on with you again. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2216.12s)]
*  Yeah, so what we have to understand with these particular attacks [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2219.12s)]
*  of the Haitian immigrant community is that they follow a 200-year tradition [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2223.12s)]
*  of Americans, white Americans, demonizing Haiti and Haitians. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2228.12s)]
*  Haiti, for those who don't know, is the only Western Hemisphere country [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2233.12s)]
*  that led a successful slave revolt against their white oppressors. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2239.12s)]
*  They won their liberation. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2244.12s)]
*  They fought and won their liberation from Napoleon, Napoleonic France in 1804. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2246.12s)]
*  And white people in America have never forgiven them for that, right? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2252.12s)]
*  The French imposed significant economic sanctions against the island nation [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2256.12s)]
*  from the very jump. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2261.12s)]
*  And the Americans, under the regime of enslaver and rapist Thomas Jefferson, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2263.12s)]
*  embargoed the country and refused to recognize their liberty and freedom. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2268.12s)]
*  And William Jefferson, the alleged lover of liberty in America, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2274.12s)]
*  refused to extend that love to the Haitian population on an island [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2278.12s)]
*  just to America's south. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2283.12s)]
*  And that has continued for the most part for the past 200 years, right? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2285.12s)]
*  This is a country that people well know is poor, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2289.12s)]
*  people well know is politically unstable, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2293.12s)]
*  and it is poor and politically unstable in part because of how the West [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2296.12s)]
*  treated this liberation faction from the very get-go. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2300.12s)]
*  The attacks, therefore, on Haitians are always wrapped into otherizing [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2304.12s)]
*  and demonizing this nation of free black people. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2310.12s)]
*  And Vance and Trump continue those attacks today, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2315.12s)]
*  which is why the attacks are so animalistic, right? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2318.12s)]
*  It's not enough that the Haitians are poor and come to this country [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2322.12s)]
*  willing to work hard and pay their taxes. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2328.12s)]
*  No, no, no, they have to be eating pets, right? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2330.12s)]
*  They have to have diseases like AIDS. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2333.12s)]
*  I mean, Guantanamo Bay, before it was known as a horrible, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2335.12s)]
*  unlawful holding cell for suspected terrorists, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2340.12s)]
*  was known as a horrible, unlawful holding cell for Haitians suspected of having HIV. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2343.12s)]
*  So this history goes back very deep. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2350.12s)]
*  I'm not saying that most of the MAGA people who are sharing cat memes right now [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2353.12s)]
*  know that history. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2359.12s)]
*  Obviously, that would require them to care about other people other than themselves, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2360.12s)]
*  and we know MAGA doesn't do that. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2365.12s)]
*  So I'm not saying they fully understand that, but JD Vance does. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2367.12s)]
*  JD Vance knows exactly what he's doing and exactly who he's doing it to. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2371.12s)]
*  So let me ask you about JD Vance. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2376.12s)]
*  We can laugh about the insanity of the pet-eating memes and claims, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2377.12s)]
*  but this is serious stuff. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2381.12s)]
*  Vance is talking, as you mentioned, about Haitians bringing HIV, AIDS, disease, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2383.12s)]
*  which is very reminiscent of Nazi rhetoric about Jews in 1930s Germany. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2387.12s)]
*  It's stochastic terrorism is the official term for it, right? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2393.12s)]
*  He is inciting public violence against Haitians through lies, innuendo, and vague rhetoric. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2398.12s)]
*  And it is working. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2405.12s)]
*  If you're JD Vance, what you were doing is working if your goal is to cause terror [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2407.12s)]
*  and pain in the Haitian community in Springfield, where people are afraid to send their kids [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2413.12s)]
*  to schools, where people have reported, Haitians have reported attacks on their property. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2418.12s)]
*  But it's also effectively locking down an entire city in JD Vance's state. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2423.12s)]
*  Springfield has had to cancel public schools for Haitian and white children in Springfield [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2429.12s)]
*  for more than a few days because of the terrorist threat. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2435.12s)]
*  They've had to cancel their town festivals because of what Vance is saying. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2438.12s)]
*  So Vance is in his zeal to hurt people of color and his zeal to demonize immigrants. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2443.12s)]
*  Vance is also hoarding a community of 60,000 folks in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2452.12s)]
*  white, black, or other, because it helps him score political points [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2457.12s)]
*  with the very worst people in the world. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2461.12s)]
*  And it's interesting that the same Republicans who lost their minds over a school closing [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2463.12s)]
*  because of COVID have no issue with a school closing because of a bomb threat [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2467.12s)]
*  that their leaders have incited. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2472.12s)]
*  And I'll be honest, Ali, very little shocks me these days, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2473.12s)]
*  but Trump's refusal over the weekend to even denounce the bomb threats in Springfield was pretty shocking. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2476.12s)]
*  He could have said, I stand by what I said, we need to investigate this stuff, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2483.12s)]
*  but of course I condemn the violence. He couldn't do it. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2486.12s)]
*  He refused on multiple occasions to condemn bomb threats against an American city. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2488.12s)]
*  As Atlantic's Adam Server once said, the cruelty is the point, right, Maddie? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2493.12s)]
*  Like what titulates their people is hurting people, right? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2497.12s)]
*  And think about it, if you're a MAGA person just sitting on Elon Musk's Twitter or social media, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2504.12s)]
*  the ability to participate in what's functionally a lynch mob against a vulnerable community [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2510.12s)]
*  from the privacy of your own home, from the privacy of your own laptop, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2517.12s)]
*  you don't have to go out and buy the rope. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2521.12s)]
*  You can just help out with the mob by sharing a few memes. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2523.12s)]
*  That kind of power, that kind of power to hurt and destroy is intoxicating [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2528.12s)]
*  for a certain kind of small minded, generally MAGA supporter, right? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2535.12s)]
*  And that's part of what we're seeing in my piece in The Nation talks about this. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2540.12s)]
*  What we're seeing online, one of the most disgusting things that we're seeing is the glee, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2544.12s)]
*  the glee that Trump supporters have knowing that they're participating in stochastic terrorism [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2549.12s)]
*  against a vulnerable community. It excites them. They feel strong and powerful doing it. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2558.12s)]
*  It's one of the worst things about their movement that this is what gives them joy, right? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2564.12s)]
*  When you looked at the Democratic National Convention, right? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2569.12s)]
*  What gave Democrats joy was the DJ spinning tunes, you know, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2571.12s)]
*  shipping up to Boston when Massachusetts was announcing its primary votes, right? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2575.12s)]
*  What gives these people joy is racism. What gives these people joy is terrorism. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2580.12s)]
*  What gives these people joy is hurting brown people. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2585.12s)]
*  And that's the difference between two parties right now. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2588.12s)]
*  It is a fundamental difference. And what's so fascinating is you mentioned stochastic terrorism and incitement. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2592.12s)]
*  Just hours after JD Vance went on CNN on Sunday and said, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2597.12s)]
*  don't you dare blame me for what happened in Ohio. He got very high and mighty. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2603.12s)]
*  Lots of pearls were clutched in his interview with Dana Bash. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2607.12s)]
*  And he said, don't you dare blame me. I'm not the person who did this. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2610.12s)]
*  I can't be held responsible for what a psycho does. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2613.12s)]
*  A few hours later, we have this attempted assassination attempt. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2615.12s)]
*  We're being told by the Secret Service they think it was an attempted assassination on Donald Trump. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2619.12s)]
*  A man has been charged on Monday. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2622.12s)]
*  And we're being told again, as we were a few months ago, that this is Democratic Party rhetoric. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2625.12s)]
*  Elon Musk and other MAGA folks are saying it's Democratic Party rhetoric that incited this threat against Trump, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2630.12s)]
*  even though we have zero evidence that Democratic Party rhetoric had anything to do with this. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2636.12s)]
*  Whereas we do have evidence that the lockdown in Ohio, the mayor of the town is blaming Trump. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2639.12s)]
*  So it's funny that they want to have their incitement cake and eat it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2645.12s)]
*  Right. Rhetoric for the but not for me is really what they're saying. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2649.12s)]
*  But let's be clear. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2653.12s)]
*  Look at the difference in the response from Democrats and liberals and people like you and me to this apparent alleged potential assassination attempt on Trump. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2656.12s)]
*  What were we saying? Political violence has no place. Right. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2666.12s)]
*  People should not be taking shots at the president or thinking about taking shots at the president or the former president. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2669.12s)]
*  We condemn the violence and we have a solution to protect Trump from these threats. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2674.12s)]
*  It's called gun regulation. Yes. Right. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2682.12s)]
*  We have a solution to protect Trump and all the residents of Florida from people toting AK-47s with bad. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2685.12s)]
*  There's no reciprocity is what you're saying. Right. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2693.12s)]
*  It's called gun regulation. Right. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2696.12s)]
*  So Democrats not only are condemning the violence, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2698.12s)]
*  they're also offering solutions to get away from this kind of potential violence. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2701.12s)]
*  Republicans, when it slipped around, not only do they encourage the violence, the only are they titillated by the violence. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2706.12s)]
*  They also have no plans to stop it. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2713.12s)]
*  And I want people to understand that it's not just the J.D. Vance and Donald Trump won't disavow, condemn or whatever the attacks going happening against Haitian immigrants today. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2716.12s)]
*  Yesterday was Venezuelans. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2726.12s)]
*  Tomorrow it will be some other black or brown immigrant group. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2728.12s)]
*  It's that they have no plan to stop people from terrorizing these vulnerable communities. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2732.12s)]
*  And I think that is really where you start to see just how depraved their movement is. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2739.12s)]
*  And of course, they also say the quiet part out loud. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2744.12s)]
*  Were you surprised to see J.D. Vance come right out and say on CNN that he is happy to create stories to get attention from the people who are in the streets? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2748.12s)]
*  To get attention on his pet issue, his far right dog whistle or should I say bullhorn? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2755.12s)]
*  And why should the liberal media quote unquote, why should it ever take anything Vance says seriously ever again? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2760.12s)]
*  Vance is able to say that because he knows that there is no accountability within his party or movement for lying. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2767.12s)]
*  Like our side doesn't like liars, right? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2773.12s)]
*  Their side, it doesn't matter. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2776.12s)]
*  It's one of the things I was saying in the lead up to the debate. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2778.12s)]
*  You can fact check Trump. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2780.12s)]
*  You should fact check Trump. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2782.12s)]
*  But understand the facts don't matter to Trump's supporters, to Trump's own people, to the people who are going to vote for Trump and Vance. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2783.12s)]
*  They don't care about the facts. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2792.12s)]
*  So Vance is reacting to the political reality of a situation where he can make up whatever he wants. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2794.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter because the people want to. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2801.12s)]
*  It's like his people want to believe the lies. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2804.12s)]
*  And so that frees Vance to lie. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2807.12s)]
*  But you asked a different question, Mehdi. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2810.12s)]
*  You asked why should the American media take anything that Vance says seriously? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2812.12s)]
*  And for that, I have no answer. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2818.12s)]
*  For that, I have no answer for why. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2820.12s)]
*  Just perpetual disappointment. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2822.12s)]
*  Let me ask you this, though. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2824.12s)]
*  You mentioned the kind of they don't care, right? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2826.12s)]
*  How do we who care about facts and reality, how do we deal with this stuff, Ali? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2828.12s)]
*  Because the right is so good at ginning up fake culture wars with fake stories and lies, which then dominate the news. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2832.12s)]
*  So instead of talking about Trump's lack of a plan for health care or Vance's extremist plan on abortion, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2840.12s)]
*  we spend our time getting outraged over and trying to fact check and debunk these ridiculous racist claims. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2846.12s)]
*  But at the same time, they're so ridiculous, so racist and so dangerous that we can't ignore them either. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2853.12s)]
*  It's a bit of a catch-22 the right have got us in. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2859.12s)]
*  Look, we have to learn how to walk and chew gum. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2862.12s)]
*  Just between us and all of your viewers, I did not want to write about this latest attack on Haitians. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2866.12s)]
*  I wanted to keep focusing on the issues that I care about, about Supreme Court reform and what have you. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2873.12s)]
*  But as part of the Haitian diaspora, I had a duty to write. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2879.12s)]
*  I had a duty to contextualize. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2886.12s)]
*  I had a duty to explain. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2888.12s)]
*  So I have to do both, right? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2890.12s)]
*  I have to both push back against these vile racist lies and keep my eye on the ball in terms of the policies that are important in the upcoming election. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2892.12s)]
*  I just have to be good enough and strong enough and energetic enough to do both. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2903.12s)]
*  And that's what I would say to everybody else. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2908.12s)]
*  We just have to walk and chew gum. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2910.12s)]
*  We have to do both. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2912.12s)]
*  Push back on the wise, focus on the policy and we'll sleep when we're dead. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2913.12s)]
*  Every Muslim watching you, including this one, feels your pain. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2917.12s)]
*  Elie Mistel, we've been there and got that t-shirt. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2921.12s)]
*  Elie Mistel, thank you for your time. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuqToJxbGC0&t=2924.12s)]
