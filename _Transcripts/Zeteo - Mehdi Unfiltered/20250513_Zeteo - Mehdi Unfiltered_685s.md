Video Description: On this episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered,’ Mehdi Hasan speaks with Texan attorney Clay Jackson on the unidentified masked agents that knocked on his door — saying he was obstructing an immigration investigation.

All Jackson did was tell an immigrant family their legal rights and offered to find them pro bono assistance. Two days later when the masked agents knocked, he realized his Wi-Fi was down and he had no Ring camera footage of the interaction.

“Are you Clayton Jackson? And I responded, yes and then the next thing they said was, you know, we have information to suggest that you're obstructing an active immigration investigation. And that's when, you know, I kind of — a light bulb in my head turned on that this was, you know, potentially something a lot more, you know, dark.”

When he went to his employer on this, he was fired immediately.

# How the U.S. is Targeting Citizens for Helping Immigrants
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0)
*  The ability to help others is a gift. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=0.0s)]
*  And if you can change someone's life for the better, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=2.6s)]
*  then helping them is not an option, but a responsibility. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=4.3s)]
*  That belief is one shared by many people here in the US, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  not people like Donald Trump or Elon Musk, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=10.28s)]
*  but people like Clay Jackson. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=12.76s)]
*  As a litigation counselor at Fortune 500 Company [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=14.8s)]
*  at Fidelity National Financial FNF, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=17.68s)]
*  Jackson was not a specialist in immigration law, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=20.32s)]
*  but when a gas station attendant asked [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=22.88s)]
*  if he could help a local immigrant family [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=24.88s)]
*  who were being targeted by ICE, Jackson could not refuse. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=26.84s)]
*  He met with the family for less than an hour, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=29.72s)]
*  told them what their rights were, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  and offered to help find them pro bono counsel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=33.08s)]
*  Two days later, after noticing his home wifi was down, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  two men who refused to identify themselves [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=39.54s)]
*  had shown up at his door, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=41.56s)]
*  probing into what they claimed was information [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=43.2s)]
*  that Jackson was obstructing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=45.68s)]
*  an ongoing immigration investigation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=47.32s)]
*  He wanted to take this story public [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=50.08s)]
*  and with the support of his employer, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=51.64s)]
*  but FNF were everything but supportive. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=53.08s)]
*  After dismissing his fears of being targeted by ICE, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  FNF fired Jackson the same day he went public [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=58.48s)]
*  with the story, despite him not naming them. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=61.12s)]
*  This story has so many horrifying details [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  that I've not even mentioned yet. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=65.36s)]
*  That is because its central character, Clay Jackson, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=67.08s)]
*  can mention them for us, he joins me now. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=69.06s)]
*  Clay, thanks so much for coming on May the Unfiltered. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=71.39999999999999s)]
*  Just start with what happened at your house. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=73.84s)]
*  We'll talk about the kind of gas station and the family, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=77.53999999999999s)]
*  but what actually happened with your house, with the wifi, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=79.52s)]
*  who were these two guys? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=82.12s)]
*  Yeah, so it was a pretty normal day [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=84.22s)]
*  and I kind of heard a knock on the door, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=86.2s)]
*  which is not uncommon. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  And I thought, just from initial appearances, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=90.78s)]
*  I thought they were trying to sell me something, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=94.36s)]
*  wifi or security system. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=96.12s)]
*  And my dogs, I work from home, my dogs are there, obviously, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=98.88s)]
*  and they're barking, so my thought is, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=103.56s)]
*  I need to get the dogs to stop barking. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=104.92s)]
*  So I opened the door and that's kind of when I realized, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=106.52000000000001s)]
*  very soon that it was not a routine sort of salesman, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=112.16s)]
*  cold knock or anything. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=116.8s)]
*  The first thing they said was, are you Clayton Jackson? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=119.52s)]
*  And I responded, yes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=121.8s)]
*  And then the next thing they said was, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  we have information to suggest that you're obstructing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=126.0s)]
*  an active immigration investigation. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=129.56s)]
*  And that's when I kind of, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=132.2s)]
*  a light bulb in my head turned on that this was, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=135.56s)]
*  potentially something a lot more, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=138.84s)]
*  dark. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  Did they identify themselves as federal agents? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=145.76s)]
*  They did not. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=148.84s)]
*  I asked, one of the questions I asked was, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=149.68s)]
*  right after they sort of said that line about obstruction [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=152.28s)]
*  was, what agency are you with [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=155.6s)]
*  and can I have your badge numbers? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=158.5s)]
*  And their response was, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=161.0s)]
*  we do not have to disclose that information at this time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=162.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=166.0s)]
*  And you couldn't get any of this [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=166.84s)]
*  on your Ring camera doorbell, why not? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=167.88s)]
*  Well, it just so happened that during that sort of period, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=171.2s)]
*  my wifi had gone down and it seemed, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=176.28s)]
*  initially I didn't really make the connection [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=182.76s)]
*  until I kind of, after that knock and I closed the door, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=185.32s)]
*  my thought was, well, maybe I can figure out [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=189.84s)]
*  who these people were, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=192.32s)]
*  just looking at the Ring camera footage. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=194.28s)]
*  And that's when I realized that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=196.44s)]
*  there was no Ring camera footage. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=197.28s)]
*  My wifi had been down for about a 30 minute period, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=198.64s)]
*  which just so happened to be the period where they knocked. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=201.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=204.52s)]
*  After that incident, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=205.36s)]
*  you sought your company's support in speaking out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=206.2s)]
*  How did those conversations go? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=208.52s)]
*  Not well, I would say. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=213.32s)]
*  I was a little discouraged just to begin with. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=214.76s)]
*  The initial response I felt was dismissive [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=218.6s)]
*  and sort of, the implication was, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=222.32000000000002s)]
*  why are you bringing something like this up right now? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  Wasting our time with this was kind of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=235.68s)]
*  the tone of the response. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  But I felt because I was an officer [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  of a Fortune 500 company, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=243.24s)]
*  that I had a duty to give them a heads up, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  that, hey, I'm gonna go on the record [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=246.68s)]
*  to talk about this thing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=248.52s)]
*  Fidelity National Financial is chaired and founded [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=250.52s)]
*  by Bill Foley, I believe, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  a major Republican donor and a Trump supporter. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=254.16000000000003s)]
*  Did you anticipate things playing out the way they did [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=256.8s)]
*  when you approached them? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=259.76s)]
*  I mean, you did leave their name out of the first piece [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=260.64s)]
*  that Radley Balko, the journalist Radley Balko, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=263.44s)]
*  who first alerted me to your story. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=265.16s)]
*  You didn't mention the company name there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=267.16s)]
*  Did you think this might cost me my job, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=268.72s)]
*  given the politics of the owner? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=270.68s)]
*  You know, I definitely knew. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=272.8s)]
*  Yeah, I knew that the politics of the founder [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=274.32s)]
*  and I would say of a large number of executives [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  were more on the conservative side. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=281.16s)]
*  And I obviously knew the connections between Mr. Foley [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  and the Trump administration, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  both Trump administrations, the first and the second. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=290.2s)]
*  But the short answer is no, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=293.36s)]
*  I didn't think that doing something like this [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=294.64s)]
*  would cost me my job. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=297.32s)]
*  I thought the way I explained it was, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=298.36s)]
*  I felt it was my professional obligation [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  to help people in my community. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=303.6s)]
*  That's what lawyers do. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=305.92s)]
*  That's why I became a lawyer. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=306.96s)]
*  And so I thought it was really a simple thing that, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=308.35999999999996s)]
*  I got caught up in something that was very scary, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=311.4s)]
*  but it's something that I would hope [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=314.08s)]
*  that most lawyers would do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=317.88s)]
*  Liking this video? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=319.52s)]

*  Are you planning on taking any legal action against them? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=348.47999999999996s)]
*  They didn't specify the policies that I purportedly violated. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  To your second question, I am represented by counsel, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=357.0s)]
*  L. Wenger Henderson is my employment counsel. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=361.32s)]
*  I'm also represented by Ken White. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=363.16s)]
*  He's representing me as my First Amendment counsel. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=366.0s)]
*  So I have great lawyers on my side. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=368.92s)]
*  Ken White of Pope Hat fame on social media. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=374.44s)]
*  And just a quick shout out to Ken White. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=375.28000000000003s)]
*  I reached out to him middle of March, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=377.68s)]
*  a few weeks after this happened, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=381.12s)]
*  and he responded in five minutes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  We were on a call in 30 minutes, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=385.32000000000005s)]
*  and he agreed to represent me pro bono [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=386.68s)]
*  within us talking that day. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=389.08000000000004s)]
*  So I really appreciate Ken. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=391.72s)]
*  Good for Ken. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=393.24s)]
*  You said in the first piece that told your story [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  that you wanted to get the word out to quote, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=396.92s)]
*  see how often this is happening because it needs to stop. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=398.88000000000005s)]
*  I wonder how often is it happening? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  Have people reached out to you since to share similar stories? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=404.12s)]
*  Yeah, I've had some similar stories. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  I think it tracks with, if you're paying attention, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=410.68s)]
*  there's all sorts of examples of this type of thing. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=414.40000000000003s)]
*  A sitting judge in Milwaukee was arrested, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=419.88s)]
*  and the charge they gave was obstructing justice. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=423.08s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think there's countless examples [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=426.64s)]
*  in the recent reporting by people like Ratley Bouko. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=430.4s)]
*  Do you believe this was a deliberate attempt by ICE, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=434.67999999999995s)]
*  by the Trump administration to intimidate a lawyer? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=437.28s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=441.52s)]
*  I really, I don't think it was necessarily [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=442.35999999999996s)]
*  a top-down decision because one of the dynamics in Texas [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=446.2s)]
*  is that Governor Abbott has basically deputized [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=451.12s)]
*  any and all state law enforcement to assist ICE [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=455.0s)]
*  as they see fit. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=459.52s)]
*  And so the only thing that I think really explains it [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=460.59999999999997s)]
*  is that it was some, as I think Ratley Bouko noted [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  in his piece, that it was some dorky attempt [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=468.0s)]
*  by some local people to, they heard that I was helping [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=470.28s)]
*  this family and they wanted to intimidate me, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=473.64s)]
*  but make no mistake, the intent, in my opinion, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  was to intimidate me. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=478.64s)]
*  And to this day, you don't know the names of those two men [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=479.76s)]
*  or even which agency they were with? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=482.0s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=484.24s)]
*  Wow, I mean, that's chilling that we live in a country now [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=485.88s)]
*  where just, you know, this is what you hear about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=487.96000000000004s)]
*  quote unquote tin-pot dictatorships, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  people turning up your door, giving you warnings [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=492.40000000000003s)]
*  without any ID. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=495.12s)]
*  You mentioned that you became a lawyer [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  because you want to help people in your community. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=498.12s)]
*  Let's take a step back. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=499.6s)]
*  The reason they came to your door was because they claimed [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=501.12s)]
*  that you might be interfering in an investigation. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  And that was to do, I believe, tell us about this family [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=505.92s)]
*  and how you ended up talking to a migrant family [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=508.56s)]
*  in your community. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=511.16s)]
*  What happened at a gas station [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=512.12s)]
*  and what happened with the family? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=513.2s)]
*  Yeah, so the gas station in my neighborhood, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=514.9200000000001s)]
*  I basically, you know, I was familiar with the attendant [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  that worked there and he knew that I was involved [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=522.48s)]
*  with a separate pro bono initiative in my community [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=525.76s)]
*  with this family that owned a barbecue restaurant. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=528.64s)]
*  And he just kind of mentioned offhand, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=530.52s)]
*  hey, there's this family. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=532.16s)]
*  One of the father was caught up in a recent workplace raid. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=534.92s)]
*  The kids are really scared. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=538.56s)]
*  They're scared to go to school, scared to go to the park. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  Can you just go by and try to give them, you know, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  just the basic understanding of their rights, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=547.28s)]
*  what happens if someone knocks, et cetera. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=549.7199999999999s)]
*  And I was like, absolutely. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  Again, I felt that was my professional obligation [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=553.24s)]
*  as a lawyer under all the, you know, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=556.52s)]
*  I'm licensed in three states. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=560.0799999999999s)]
*  Every one of those states has a rule that says, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=561.4s)]
*  lawyers have an obligation to provide pro bono assistance [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=563.48s)]
*  to people in their community. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=567.16s)]
*  I thought it was that simple. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=568.2s)]
*  So I went over there and had a very informal sort of, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=569.48s)]
*  you know, conversation about their rights. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=572.88s)]
*  And I can say, you know, the thing that struck me [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=575.24s)]
*  was just the palpable sense of fear among everyone there. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=578.0s)]
*  Seeing the kids, you know, being scared to go to school, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=583.0s)]
*  scared to go to the park, scared to just be kids. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=587.08s)]
*  I think that was something that really startled me. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=590.6s)]
*  And, you know, it made me feel like I was doing [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=593.5200000000001s)]
*  the right thing in that moment, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=597.84s)]
*  that these people needed help. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  Last question, Clay. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=600.84s)]
*  A lot of big law firms have been rolling over [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=602.96s)]
*  for Donald Trump, doing deals, offering pro bono services. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=604.72s)]
*  How much faith can ordinary Americans who are worried [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=609.12s)]
*  about rising authoritarianism America, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=612.24s)]
*  how much faith can they have in big law right now? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=613.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, I wish I could say that they could have [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=616.48s)]
*  you know, more faith than I do, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=620.8s)]
*  because I don't have a lot of faith. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=622.8s)]
*  When I see, you know, big white shoe law firms, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=624.1999999999999s)]
*  quote, make a deal with a presidential administration [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=627.52s)]
*  that's, you know, pretty clear in its intent [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  to test every single constitutional boundary that exists. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=635.0s)]
*  That to me, you know, I couldn't, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=639.88s)]
*  if I represented somebody, I couldn't in good faith [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=642.4s)]
*  tell them that their interests are, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=644.52s)]
*  especially if I represented somebody [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=646.88s)]
*  adverse to the government. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=648.12s)]
*  In good faith, it would be impossible for me as an attorney [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=649.48s)]
*  to tell a client that their interests are represented [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=651.8000000000001s)]
*  to the fullest extent that is required under, you know, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCSp7sLOBC0&t=655.8800000000001s)]
