Video Description: “The Pentagon’s budget in 2023 was already a whopping $805 billion. And this year, that number climbed to $842 billion — the largest defense budget in American history, even though supposedly we’re not at war right now. And that $37 billion increase is higher than the roughly 30 billion dollars spent on child nutrition programs. It’s even higher than NASA’s entire 25 billion dollar budget.”

Watch Mehdi Hasan break down four reasons why DOGE, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, should go after defense spending to save taxpayer money and make the government more efficient.

# 4 Ways Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy Can Cut $2T in US Spending
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE)
*  DOGE. That's a reference to the new Department of Government Efficiency [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=0.0s)]
*  and not the 2013 online meme that's since been co-opted by a lot of [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=3.96s)]
*  crypto bros and incels. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=7.76s)]
*  Talking of bros, Trump's DOGE will be co-run by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=10.24s)]
*  And they have grand plans to save taxpayer money. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=15.44s)]
*  Grand plans. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=18.76s)]
*  How much do you think we can rip out of this wasted [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=19.96s)]
*  $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think we can do at least $2 trillion. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=29.2s)]
*  Yeah! [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=31.52s)]
*  Yes, you heard that right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=33.04s)]
*  Elon and Vivek are going to wipe out $2 trillion worth of US spending. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=34.64s)]
*  Slash it right down. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=38.72s)]
*  But beside the fact that Trump's essentially awarded these two rich [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=40.48s)]
*  supporters of his a participation trophy for their loyalty, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=43.16s)]
*  nothing screams government efficiency like hiring two people to do the same job. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=46.56s)]
*  Congratulations, guys. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=51.2s)]
*  Look, jokes aside, I actually agree our government is not running [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  as efficiently as it could. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=55.56s)]
*  What I don't agree with is that this is the solution. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  75% headcount reduction across the board in the federal bureaucracy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=60.63999999999999s)]
*  Send them home packing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=65.24s)]
*  Shut down agencies that shouldn't exist. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=66.56s)]
*  Rescind every unconstitutional regulation that Congress never passed. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=68.84s)]
*  I'm going to come back to the 75% reduction in a moment, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=73.16s)]
*  but first let's take a step back and take a look at the entire federal budget. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=75.92s)]
*  US spending is broken down into three categories. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=79.6s)]
*  Mandatory, discretionary and net interest payments. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=82.6s)]
*  In 2023, the US spent 62% of its $6.1 trillion budget [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=86.08000000000001s)]
*  on mandatory entitlement programs like social security and Medicare, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=91.48s)]
*  which, by the way, Trump vowed not to slash during his campaign. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  So cutting mandatory spending is really out of the question here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=99.72s)]
*  But what then does that actually leave us with? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, discretionary spending made up roughly 28% of the budget. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  That's it. 28%. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=111.0s)]
*  And that's where Musk and Ramaswamy are going to make all their savings, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=112.92s)]
*  are going to try and slash 75% of government jobs. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=116.19999999999999s)]
*  But first off, it's not that easy to just snap your fingers [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=120.0s)]
*  and make 75% of the federal workforce disappear. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  And even if you could fire 75% of government employees just like that, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=126.08s)]
*  and without making the government itself collapse, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=130.6s)]
*  according to the Congressional Budget Office, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  the US spent roughly $271 billion on personnel costs in 2022. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=134.8s)]
*  So Doge cutting 75% of government jobs [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  would save around $200 billion a year, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  a drop in the bucket compared to the US's $1.8 trillion deficit, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  and just 10% of the $2 trillion that Musk ambitiously said he'd cut. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=151.72s)]
*  But look, in the spirit of America coming together, working together, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  I want to help Vivek and Elon make our government more efficient. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  I want to help them save taxpayer money. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=164.64s)]
*  So what if I told you that we could save over a trillion dollars, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=167.2s)]
*  over 10 years, by cutting from just one government department, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=170.16s)]
*  a department that makes up almost half of all discretionary spending, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=174.32s)]
*  a government department that has failed its annual audit [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=177.76s)]
*  for seven years in a row? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=180.6s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the United States Department of Defense. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=182.8s)]
*  Yes, the Pentagon, whose budget in 2023 was already a whopping $805 billion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=187.24s)]
*  And this year, that number climbed to $842 billion, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=193.16s)]
*  the largest defense budget in American history, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=196.8s)]
*  even though supposedly we're not at war right now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=198.92s)]
*  And that $37 billion increase is, I should add, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=201.76s)]
*  higher than the roughly $30 billion we spend on child nutrition programs. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=204.92s)]
*  It's even higher than NASA's entire $25 billion budget. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=209.48s)]
*  But let's zoom out here so we can really put into a global context [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=213.2s)]
*  just how ludicrously massive the US defense budget is. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=217.64s)]
*  Because not only is it the largest in the world, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  but last year US defense spending was more than the next nine biggest [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=223.76s)]
*  defense budgets combined. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  Combined. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, $842 billion is an insane amount of money, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=231.64s)]
*  and the Department of Defense can't even keep track of it. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  Vivek, Elon, that's what you need to be cutting. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=239.56s)]
*  I know you guys and Doge are obsessed with the federal government [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  spending money on studies like whether tequila or gin [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  makes sunfish more aggressive. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=248.72s)]
*  But the Pentagon has also been known to spend ridiculous amounts [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=250.76s)]
*  on ridiculous things. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=253.64s)]
*  $10,000 on toilet seat lids, $1,200 on coffee cups, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=254.96s)]
*  and $435 on hammers. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=258.92s)]
*  And let's not forget that earlier this year, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=261.32s)]
*  the Department of Defense spent $230 million to build a temporary pier [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=262.76s)]
*  to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, only for it to kill one soldier, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=267.72s)]
*  float away and shut down after just 20 days of use. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=271.44s)]
*  But look, this is all chump change. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=275.24s)]
*  Let's talk about how Doge can cut big money [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=277.44s)]
*  by taking an axe to the Pentagon budget. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=279.88s)]
*  The good news is the work's already been done, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=282.68s)]
*  because the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=285.64s)]
*  outlined in 2021 three ways that the Department of Defense [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  could change its military approach to cut a trillion dollars [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  over the next 10 years. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=294.84s)]
*  Oh, and in 2018, it also outlined 16 areas [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=296.2s)]
*  where the Department of Defense can cut at least $10 billion [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=299.59999999999997s)]
*  each over the next decade. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=302.96s)]
*  So here are just three of many suggestions from the CBO. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=305.28s)]
*  First, the DoD could make changes to DoD structure [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=309.36s)]
*  and personnel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=313.32s)]
*  The CBO says that the Defense Department [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=314.32s)]
*  could save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=316.16s)]
*  by reducing headcount 20%. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  And in its 2018 report, the CBO also suggested [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  that the DoD could replace some of its military personnel, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=323.56s)]
*  like those in finance and accounting, with civilian employees. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=326.52000000000004s)]
*  This would replace 80,000 jobs with 64,000 civilian employees [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  and cut $14 billion worth of spending. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=334.92s)]
*  And what would personnel cuts do to our military strength? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=337.92s)]
*  The US has the third largest military in the world [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=340.88s)]
*  behind China and India. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=343.2s)]
*  There are roughly 1.3 million active duty service members. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  If we cut 80,000 jobs, the US military would still remain [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=347.72s)]
*  within the top four largest militaries in the world, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=350.72s)]
*  just after North Korea. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=353.12s)]
*  If we were to reduce the entire force by 20%, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=354.64s)]
*  roughly 265,000 people, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=357.40000000000003s)]
*  the US would still remain in the top five. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=360.0s)]
*  Number two, why not get rid of the most expensive weapons program [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=363.76s)]
*  in American history? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=367.56s)]
*  We're going to talk to you about the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=368.8s)]
*  which has cost the US over $2 trillion since 2001. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=371.84s)]
*  The Joint Strike Fighter Program was launched in 2001 [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  with the goal of rolling out F-35 fighter jet fleets. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=379.56s)]
*  Yet here we are over two decades later, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=383.36s)]
*  and the program has still not been completed [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=385.36s)]
*  or considered successful. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=387.48s)]
*  Between manufacturing issues, production delays, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  technical risks, including a 2017 report that warned [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=391.76s)]
*  ejection seat floors could kill up to two dozen American pilots [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=394.96s)]
*  in the lifetime of the program, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=398.28s)]
*  and a more recent report highlighting that its guns [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=399.88s)]

*  And yet Congress is obsessed with the program. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=419.08s)]
*  It wanted to buy 76 extra jets, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=421.08s)]
*  eight more than the Pentagon even asked for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=423.28s)]

*  I mean, there's even a bipartisan Congressional caucus [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=428.08s)]
*  for the Joint Strike Fighter Program. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=431.68s)]
*  It has its own frickin' Congressional caucus. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=433.68s)]
*  Get rid of that, and get rid of the F-35s. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=436.68s)]

*  A ton of money in the Pentagon, private contracts. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=477.08000000000004s)]
*  In 2022, the DOD spent $415 billion on federal contracts, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=480.88s)]
*  more money than all other government agencies [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=485.88s)]
*  combined spent on contracts. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=487.88s)]
*  Just this year, Boeing was found to have overcharged the Air Force [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=490.48s)]
*  nearly 8,000% for soap dispensers. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=493.68s)]
*  It's a problem that has plagued the Department of Defense [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=498.28s)]
*  for decades, with the DOD having become a revolving door [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=500.48s)]
*  to the private sector. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=503.88s)]

*  It's a cash cow of corruption, allowing Pentagon officials [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=521.88s)]
*  to profit off an exorbitant defense budget paid for [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=524.88s)]
*  by the American taxpayer. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=527.88s)]
*  The US government could save over $400 billion [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=530.08s)]
*  by getting rid of that revolving door [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=533.88s)]

*  Because over the past 16 years, one particular billionaire [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=545.08s)]

*  $5 billion of which came from the Department of Defense alone. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=551.68s)]
*  Yes, the co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=555.48s)]
*  himself, Mr. Elon Musk. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSxqer4LeE&t=558.88s)]
