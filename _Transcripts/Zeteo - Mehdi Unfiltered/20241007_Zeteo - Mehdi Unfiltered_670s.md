Video Description: "A year has passed… every chance, every avenue, every road, to some kind of agreement was torpedoed,” Zahiro Shahar Mor, the nephew of former Israeli hostage Avraham Munder, 79, tells Mehdi Hasan as he discuss his uncle's life and death, and his personal activism in the latest ‘Mehdi Unfiltered' episode.

Mor's uncle’s body was found in a tunnel in Khan Yunis. Officials have not yet determined the cause of death. For Mor, the loss of his uncle has only strengthened his opposition to his government’s handling of the conflict, the genocide, and the hostages still held in Gaza.

Since Oct. 7, Mor has been protesting and campaigning, along with many other families of hostages, for a ceasefire and an end to the violence. He is now calling for international intervention to bring peace to the region.

# "We are all being taken hostage by our governments": Hostage’s nephew condemns Netanyahu
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig)
*  Joining me now is Zahiro Shahamur. He's the nephew of Avraham Munda whose body was recovered from a tunnel in Khan Yunis in August [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=0.0s)]
*  Zahiro has been arrested at least eight times by Israeli authorities since the start of the war for his activism against [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=8.28s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu and in favor of a hostage deal. Zahiro, thank you for coming back on Mehdi Unfiltered. Since we last spoke [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=13.96s)]
*  You received the news and received the body of your uncle, your late uncle Avraham Munda [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=22.26s)]
*  I'm so sorry for your loss and what happened to him in Gaza. Do we know what happened? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=27.64s)]
*  No, we don't we don't have any confirmation about the cause of death of my uncle [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=34.0s)]
*  There are two main options [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  either he was [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=41.6s)]
*  killed by his captors, you know when the IDF was around enough to get them scared [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=43.64s)]
*  Or there is a possibility that he was [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=52.6s)]
*  suffocated in the tunnel from a residue of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=56.32s)]
*  CO [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  gas [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=63.32s)]
*  from one of the bombs Israel is using [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=64.44s)]
*  so [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=68.52s)]
*  Either way, we don't know yet. We're waiting for [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=69.96s)]
*  We do know in other cases that hostages have been killed by Israel while trying to rescue them [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=73.28s)]
*  This is why some of us you and I have tried to end this war and while of course [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=78.16s)]
*  We should blame Hamas for taking him hostage, which is a war crime an elderly man a non-combatant [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=81.92s)]
*  You blame Netanyahu for not doing a deal to free him before he died in Gaza. Is that correct? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=88.0s)]
*  Correct, correct. It has been a year Mehdi. It has been a year [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=95.08s)]
*  Yes [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  You know the first day on October 7th last year when my cousin Karen got to Gaza [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=99.44s)]
*  her captor [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=107.88s)]
*  Told her I don't don't be so afraid that one or two days and you'll be home. It's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=109.68s)]
*  unimaginable that we are now a year has passed and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  You know every chance every a [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=121.04s)]
*  Venue that every every Avenue every every road to some kind of agreement was torpedoed [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  So and we know this we know this for a fact we have [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=134.8s)]
*  All the other all the events were on record all the other torpedoes that the torpedoing [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=138.48s)]
*  Yes is on record. This will be remembered for for you know for history [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=144.83999999999997s)]
*  But just to be clear had Netanyahu extended a version of what they did in November or what was proposed in June [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=149.6s)]
*  Your uncle could be alive today [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=156.72s)]
*  Correct, correct. My uncle survived the Gaza and tunnel for four to six months [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  We will never know the exact date probably but four to six months and he was 79 with the conditions and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=164.6s)]
*  We are [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=172.88s)]
*  very unimaginable what what it is his last [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=174.88s)]
*  Months of life has been and we are we are very sorry for your loss. We acknowledged a year in there are still [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=179.16s)]
*  Over a hundred hostages. We don't know alive or dead in Gaza [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=186.88s)]
*  You have sadly experienced having family members both rescued and now killed in Gaza [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=190.83999999999997s)]
*  Your uncle's body was recovered as we said in August [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  His wife daughter and grandson were released during that one hostage deal last November between Israel and Hamas [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  So I wonder zero what was your reaction during? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=205.88s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's recent speech at the United Nations when he boasted that quote Israel has brought home a hundred and fifty four of these hostages [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=208.72s)]
*  Including a hundred and seventeen who returned alive, which is interesting given he was never in favor of doing it that way [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=217.28s)]
*  Correct, correct. It's you know, it's it's it's satirical in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=225.08s)]
*  Historic proportions really this I [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=232.36s)]
*  It's unimaginable that the the levels of cynicism [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=235.84s)]
*  Yeah, that is going on here within the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  Israeli government and I just wanted to add if I may that also my cousin [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=243.92s)]
*  50 years old was killed on October 7th in front of his house in kibbutz near Oz [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=250.0s)]
*  My beloved cousin. So yeah, I don't believe that any are one bit and and he's all [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=255.6s)]
*  firstly [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  He speaks differently in Israel and abroad. Yes, of course [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=263.76s)]
*  And you mentioned in Hebrew and in English [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=267.52s)]
*  Yes, he does which is ironically what the Israelis used to say about Arafat that he speaks in two tongues [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=270.56s)]

*  Yes [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=354.41999999999996s)]

*  Zahir we're one year in and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=385.66s)]
*  Even under a renewed threat of rocket fire in Tel Aviv protests are still taking place every weekend pushing for a hostage [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=388.22s)]
*  Yeah, I believe you've just come from a protest at what point do you see any of the public pressure? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=395.3s)]
*  Working against Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition should protesters be doing something different because what they've done so far sadly hasn't worked [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=400.38s)]
*  This is my [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=411.54s)]

*  You know much lesser chances to survive. This is a must what we're doing and zero [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  You're sure that Israeli society can sustain a major revolution now [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=447.74s)]
*  and and and you know the forces of good can overcome evil and [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=452.65999999999997s)]

*  People tend to rally around their government when they're under attack has the Iranian rocket attack has what's happening in Lebanon with Hezbollah [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=474.1s)]
*  Has that made the protests much harder for you guys has that made your movement less popular inside of Israel as people now focus on? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=481.58000000000004s)]
*  bigger regional issues and maybe forget about the hostages in Gaza [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POn1HBB1Vig&t=488.62s)]
