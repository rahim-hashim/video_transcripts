Video Description: “It's very strange to watch these people who are essentially trying to smuggle humanitarian aid into Gaza. You could say there's a bit of life imitating art, or art imitating life.”
Actor Liam Cunningham, star of Game of Thrones, joins Mehdi Hasan on this episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’ to discuss his support for the liberation of Palestine, his experience with the Gaza aid flotilla coalition and holding governments accountable. He also shares how parts of Game of Thrones and the genocide in Gaza are imitations of one another.

# How Israel Imitates Game of Thrones
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40)
*  It is one thing to condemn, rebuke and criticize Israel for its genocide against Palestinians in occupied Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=0.0s)]
*  but it's a whole different ballgame when you put your life on the line to actually do something about it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=5.84s)]
*  On Sunday, a group of activists sailed from Catania, Sicily to do just that. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=10.88s)]
*  On a ship named the Madeline, acclaimed activist and Zateo contributor Greta Thunberg, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=15.52s)]
*  along with several other high-profile activists, are carrying humanitarian aid and heading towards the shores of Gaza as we speak. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=20.32s)]
*  The dangers of that journey, however, do not lie in the depths of the water that they sail in, but the skies they're sailing under. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=27.52s)]
*  That's because a similar mission to sail to occupied Gaza in May was aborted after the flotilla dubbed the Conscience suffered two drone attacks while in international waters. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Hoping the world has grown enough of a conscience and a spine since then not to allow that to happen again, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=43.92s)]
*  the group departed the port on Sunday with the support of many people around the world, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  including the support of Game of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham, aka Davos Seaworth, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=54.24s)]
*  who was there and who's been outspoken in support of Palestinian rights in recent months. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  I'm delighted to say he joins me now. Liam, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for having me, Matt. It's a pleasure to be here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=68.72s)]
*  How did it feel for you as you saw that group off in Sicily, knowing both the urgent need for such a mission, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=71.36s)]
*  but also the dangers inherent in doing it? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=78.88s)]
*  It was extraordinarily strange because there was a huge celebration because the amount of people that turned up in Catania, Sicily, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=82.56s)]
*  to see us off and there was music and there was celebration. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=90.64s)]
*  And then this sudden lull as we all kind of stepped off, those who weren't going on the trip stepped off the boat [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  and we watched in silence as they as they sailed towards the horizon. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=103.04s)]
*  And it was it was just really odd because people were trying to get difficult to make eye contact with each other, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=108.64s)]
*  trying to stay positive, optimistic. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=116.0s)]
*  In my case, and I think I talked to a couple of people about this as well, they were feeling guilty, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=121.28s)]
*  they're feeling bad because the people that they are going to try and help are in a hell of a lot worse situation. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=127.28s)]
*  So there's even a bit of guilt over feeling sad for these people that are heading off into the unknown. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=133.11999999999998s)]
*  Liam, what's the expectation for this mission? What does success look like here if when that ship reaches Gaza? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=141.04s)]
*  Well, it's probably best to describe that by saying what's inside the ship. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  There is crutches, which the IDF will not allow into Gaza. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=154.48s)]
*  There is a baby formula, very short. There are antibiotics, there are morphine for painkillers for all of the people who are in excruciating pain. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=162.72s)]
*  There is even a 3D printed prosthetic baby's arm that they're trying to bring in. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=171.04s)]
*  They are trying to deliver this equipment for a number of reasons, obviously on the pragmatic side to help [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=178.32s)]
*  and also on the symbolic side that you haven't been forgotten and this blockade will be broken one way or the other. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=185.04s)]
*  The danger to the ship, we hope, is lessened by the fact that it is such a high profile delegation this time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=195.44s)]
*  Greta Thunberg, who is a household name around the world, she's a colleague of ours here at Zateo, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  she's become a legendary activist even at the age of 22 and all of the celebrity endorsements, including your own, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  is the theory that that makes the people on board a little bit safer this time? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=213.44s)]
*  I don't think so. I don't think it alleviates the tension because we've seen what the IDF are capable of [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=219.92s)]
*  and what the Netanyahu regime are capable of. There is no logic behind it, there is no humanity behind it, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=228.32s)]
*  there's no morality behind it and there is no ethics behind it. So to appeal to the humanity of the people [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=236.56s)]
*  that are responsible for a genocide is a fool's errand probably. So we go not in the hope we'd be safe, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=244.56s)]
*  and God knows what will happen in the future, in the hope that they can get through and if they are [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=256.64s)]
*  stopped the world will be watching. So we've already seen this flotilla being threatened, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=263.44s)]
*  US Senator Lindsey Graham, hardcore Republican supporter of Israel, he tweeted, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=270.0s)]
*  hope Greta and her friends can swim. Others have made similar comments on social media. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=274.64s)]
*  What is your response to Senator Graham when you hear a sitting member of the United States Senate [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=280.48s)]
*  basically saying a bunch of non-violent, unarmed, civilian peace activists should be drowned at sea [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=285.68s)]
*  basically? Well I have my ongoing phrase on social media is putting out statements like that and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=292.4s)]
*  he's not alone in this stuff. As you said there's been other reports of it. I usually hit it where [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=300.64s)]
*  with the hope that people think about it is this is where we are. So it's any of these things I [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=307.2s)]
*  expect no better from that particular person. It's not unexpected, one can clutch one's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=313.52s)]
*  pearls but he shows a true side of himself and where his humanity is and the fact that he is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=320.72s)]
*  representing people that are paying his salary and he is speaking like that about human beings trying [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  to do something good for the world just shows you this in a large sense the state of American [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=334.16s)]
*  politics as we speak. Liking this video? Then don't just watch, hit like, share and subscribe [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  and tap the bell so you never miss a video or live show but if you want early access to exclusive [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=347.2s)]
*  content then you have to head to Zateo.com and subscribe now. You'll be supporting fearless [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=352.48s)]
*  independent journalism. You are someone who hasn't been shy about your support for the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=358.24s)]
*  Palestinian cause, for Palestinian freedom. I just wonder and asked this to a lot of celebrities, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=362.72s)]
*  public figures who've been talking about Gaza since October the 7th including on my show. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Is this a subject you followed for years, decades or is this something you came to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=371.92s)]
*  because of the current genocide? No, the amusing thing is I've been probably shouting about this [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=376.4s)]
*  for about 40 years but until I was gifted a profile because of Game of Thrones there wasn't [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  too many ears that my messages met or achieved but I suppose it's through the profile that I have [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  and the situation has got, by a multiple got worse, that I've had to shout a lot louder and [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=403.28s)]
*  a lot more often and to a lot more people. It's incredibly important. And you've said in the past [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=410.47999999999996s)]
*  we play dress up, we tell stories. What are they going to do? Shoot me in the street for speaking [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=416.55999999999995s)]
*  up? I agree with you but why don't more celebrities with platforms like yours see things that way do [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=422.64s)]
*  you think? Well there's an element of fear. Almost every interview that I do I get asked and it's [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=427.92s)]
*  an understandable question. Are you worried about this affecting your career? I think it's more [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=435.92s)]
*  important to throw that question back at the questioner. What makes you think that it will [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=441.12s)]
*  affect my career? Look the bottom line on this is whatever penciled list I may or may not be on, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=446.8s)]
*  since this is kicked off the list that I have is a hell of a lot longer than the ones that I might [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=455.36s)]
*  be on. So I don't have a problem with any of this. I need to look at my kids are grown up now and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=460.08s)]
*  they go and marches with me and they are of the same mind for obvious reasons. But if grandkids [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=466.32s)]
*  ever come along I need to be able to look them in the eye when they're in college and learning [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  about this atrocity that when they turn around and go what did you do I can say I had a go, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=479.04s)]
*  I tried this. And as I've said before in World War II when the horror of the Holocaust was going [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=486.32s)]
*  on people had a legitimate reason to say that they did nothing about it because they didn't know. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  This particular genocide is in 4k, everybody knows about it and you can't say you didn't know. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=499.68s)]
*  Your answer is going to have to be I didn't care. Well said. I interviewed football legend, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=506.08s)]
*  BBC former BBC host Gary Lineker on this show a little over a year ago about him speaking out [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=514.48s)]
*  in Gaza and he said at the time that there's a lot of heavy lobbying on people to be quiet so I [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=519.52s)]
*  understand why most people refrained but I'm getting on a bit now. I'm fairly secure I can't [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=524.4s)]
*  be silent about what's happening here. I mean what have you been a have you been subjected to that [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  kind of lobbying that Gary talked about and B do you find there's a difference in terms of where [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=534.32s)]
*  you are in the world for example you've acted in Hollywood and American shows do you think people [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=540.72s)]
*  in Europe are a little bit more freer to speak out than people in the US I'm just wondering. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=545.0400000000001s)]
*  Well what is extraordinary is that for the first time in the history of the connection between [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=549.6s)]
*  Ireland and the US and you know I'm not sure how many of those is that 30 or 50 million [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=555.44s)]
*  Irish Americans that figures could be way low I'm not sure. There is a government advisory that if [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=560.96s)]
*  you do have any phones to completely dispose of your social media that phones will randomly be [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=567.52s)]
*  checked at airports and that level of McCarthyism has never surfaced before. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=576.24s)]
*  It's not a clear difference between Europe and the States at the minute you can see what's going on [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=585.92s)]
*  in Berlin and how people are being beaten by riot cops for just peaceful protests. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=591.12s)]
*  And there's a I mean just today the the dockers the longshoremen in France have refused to touch [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=600.72s)]
*  the containers as I'm sure you reported on and these containers have been which is it 14 tons [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=610.4s)]
*  of equipment that was supposed to be going to Israel. So all the platitudes. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=617.1999999999999s)]
*  What about your industry specifically? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=621.04s)]
*  Oh and my industry specifically yeah I have not come across anything specific [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=622.4s)]
*  there has been no I'd love it I would absolutely love I want the mask off I want to know who these [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=630.4799999999999s)]
*  people are who may be threatening my career and if they hide in the shadows they're not they're [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=636.2399999999999s)]
*  not scary at all they're the ones who are fearful if they won't show their face. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=642.32s)]
*  A lot of is happening in plain sight you had the BBC recently cancel a scheduled interview [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=646.88s)]
*  apparently between Gary Lineker and liveable star Mosul over the over concerns that a pair might [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=651.12s)]
*  talk about Gaza right a decision that you called beyond pathetic on social media. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=658.48s)]
*  What do you make of the BBC's coverage of this? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=665.12s)]
*  Well there's been a lot of because of the flow tail and I was there for the launch for a few [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=668.32s)]
*  days and stuff like that I have recently been and I haven't replied to the email yet I just got it [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=673.44s)]
*  today to ask me to go on to BBC news and there is not a hope in hell of me going on the BBC [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=678.4s)]
*  at the moment and I have a magnificent relationship with the BBC I would not have had a career [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=685.52s)]
*  on TV certainly without the BBC they've been incredibly kind to me the UK have been incredibly [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=691.36s)]
*  kind to me and my career I will be eternally grateful as the US has as well however BBC news [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=696.16s)]
*  is just it's jaw-dropping it's like watching a movie with a BBC news insert in it and I can't [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=705.04s)]
*  believe what I'm seeing it's it's what was it Paul Krugman talked about the the tyranny of even [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=712.56s)]
*  handedness I think the first time I'd read it he'd use that phrase yes this excuse of impartiality [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=719.5200000000001s)]
*  and if I may borrow a striking metaphor are we saying due to impartiality that if this was 1944 [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  1945 when we discovered the horrors of Auschwitz would we be contacting Heinrich Himmler for his [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=736.24s)]
*  take on the genocide because that's what's going on now it's I find it astonishing [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=743.2s)]
*  I mean I'm laughing but I should be crying it is it's a tragic scene that we're in where as you say [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=750.32s)]
*  people want to be even handed in a genocide you don't even have to go back to World War II [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't think the BBC wait for the Russian military response every time they report on a [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  missile attack on Kiev I think they don't trust the Russian military rightly so but for some reason [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=764.24s)]
*  the Israeli military gets a pass you are Irish the Irish government was the first in the EU to [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=770.32s)]
*  call what's happening in Gaza a genocide they've been miles ahead of other European countries [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=775.76s)]
*  in terms of their response to Gaza and yet recently Catherine Connolly an independent in [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=780.64s)]
*  the parliament accused the Irish government of not doing enough to punish Israel where do you stand [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=785.12s)]
*  on your country's response to the genocide the population of Ireland I'm incredibly proud of [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=789.12s)]
*  we're 100 percent behind or at least 95 percent behind [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=795.2s)]
*  self-determination and freedom for the Palestinians our governments are with a capital P pathetic [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=801.12s)]
*  they are appalling and to give you an example of that we had a bill that was shot down to [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=810.08s)]
*  disallow Israeli war bonds to be sold by the central bank the government shot it down getting [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=817.12s)]
*  rid of it the following day the Israeli IDF opened fire on Irish troops in Lebanon who [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=822.96s)]
*  are part of wearing the blue berets yes so that's the that's the thanks that we got we've also got [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=830.32s)]
*  an occupied territories bill which is going to disallow Ireland from dealing with anything from [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=836.64s)]
*  the occupied territories which you would imagine would have already been there for the last 25 [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=843.6s)]
*  years or more and there's there seemingly is an attempt to water that down so I think what they're [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=848.24s)]
*  trying to get through is the optics they're probably going to try and ban oranges and olives [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=856.08s)]
*  from Israel and try and hang on to the rest which won't be good enough just before we wrap up Liam [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=860.32s)]
*  a lot of the reactions to your presence at the send-off of the madeleine in Sicily center on [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=866.8s)]
*  this theme of oh you know life imitating art referring to your game of thrones character as [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=872.08s)]
*  a knight and a smuggler at Davos Seaworth game of thrones is obviously a show that centers around [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  the abuse of power dehumanization war conflict I wonder if you sometimes can't help but draw [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=885.2s)]
*  parallels between a show you're in and some of the cruelty we saw on screen in that show [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=892.48s)]
*  and what we see in real life these days it's it's absolutely extraordinary and if you look [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  at the character of Davos Seaworth he's been he was described as kind of the moral compass of the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  piece and I think our wonderful producers and directors the wonderful David Benioff and Dan [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=906.8000000000001s)]
*  Weiss saw him as a as a terrific device to kind of represent the audience to represent people to [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=911.6s)]
*  ask the questions on behalf of the audience we can't do this if we do that we're just [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=919.12s)]
*  turning into the people that were trying to stop doing that so because of my sort of [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=923.68s)]
*  dealings with refugees for a number of years and different scenarios it didn't take me long to [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  find the character shall we say many years yes and and what you're seeing now in real life is [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=936.64s)]
*  that exactly giving you throwbacks to that character and that it's it's very it's very [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=942.16s)]
*  strange to watch these people who are essentially trying to smuggle humanitarian aid into Gaza it's [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=947.52s)]
*  it's yeah you could say there's a bit of life imitating art or art imitating life indeed [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=954.24s)]
*  last question Liam your activism and your acting career are coming together I believe in this [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=962.0799999999999s)]
*  upcoming film Palestine 36 where you're going to be sharing the screen with Hollywood legend [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=967.12s)]
*  Jeremy Irons with succession star Hema Bass and many others what can you tell us about this film [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=972.48s)]
*  it's almost complete and as the title says it is the movie about Palestine obviously before the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  creation of Israel in 1936 and the British mess that was created and I play I wasn't happy about [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=987.76s)]
*  playing them but I had to a vile Irish man who was called Charles Teggert who had already caused [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=997.2s)]
*  immense amount of damage in India for the British and was regarded as being very effective and they [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=1004.24s)]
*  there were six assassination attempts on him while he was in India they moved him off to Israel he [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=1009.84s)]
*  was the guy put in the Teggert forts and basically got the pencil out like they did in Iraq in 22 [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=1014.88s)]
*  and got the pencil out and and basically almost designated the size of what Israel was going to be [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=1020.96s)]
*  but it should be hopefully an extraordinary movie I haven't seen the finished product yet [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTCPu9wxa40&t=1029.1200000000001s)]
