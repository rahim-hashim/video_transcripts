Video Description: For the first time since 1968, a sitting U.S. president decided not to run for re-election. But how will Vice President Kamala Harris fare against Donald Trump? And how do progressive Members of Congress feel about Biden’s decision to bow out of the race? Mehdi Hasan spoke to Congressman Ro Khanna of California - who also discusses why he won’t be attending Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday.

# "She's energizing the party": Rep. Ro Khanna on whether Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [July 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc)
*  Joining me now is Congressman Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=0.0s)]
*  Northern California, where Vice President Harris hails from. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=3.12s)]
*  He's the ranking member on the House Armed Services Committee [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=5.76s)]
*  and was a member of the Biden campaign's National Advisory Board. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=8.24s)]
*  Congressman, welcome to May the Unfiltered. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=11.52s)]
*  Excited to be on. Congratulations on the show. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=13.16s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you so much. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=15.0s)]
*  Were you surprised by the Biden announcement on Sunday? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=16.76s)]
*  Did you think it was going to happen? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=19.72s)]
*  Because on Friday morning, his campaign manager was on Morning Joe, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=21.12s)]
*  saying, he's campaigning next week, he's in this race, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=24.16s)]
*  and then Sunday, done. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=26.52s)]
*  I was surprised. In fact, I was on Sunday TV, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=27.96s)]
*  defending the president, both in the morning and on Jen Psaki... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  Oh, they didn't give you a heads-up? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=33.88s)]
*  They did not. Oh, always awkward. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=35.52s)]
*  They said, no, he's in the race. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=36.92s)]
*  So, obviously, I didn't have any clue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=38.32s)]
*  And I don't think people, other than in his very, very close inner circle, knew. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=40.92s)]
*  That was one of the criticisms of Biden, that he has his inner circle [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=45.24s)]
*  and that others weren't able to penetrate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=47.8s)]
*  But in the end, he got the message, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=49.2s)]
*  you were not someone who called on Biden to step aside, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=51.52s)]
*  unlike dozens of other House Democrats who did come out, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=54.160000000000004s)]
*  like Adam Schiff, your fellow California Democrat. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=56.68s)]
*  Why did you not think Biden should have to step aside? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=59.52s)]
*  And do you regret now not doing so, calling for him to step aside, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=62.4s)]
*  given he's now done it? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=65.6s)]
*  I don't regret it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=67.04s)]
*  I think that many progressives thought he was adopting a bold progressive agenda, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=68.2s)]
*  that he was adopting rent caps, he was coming out for strengthening, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=72.48s)]
*  expanding Social Security, coming out for Supreme Court term limits. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  And many of us thought that that could win. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  I still think he could have won, though I do acknowledge [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=82.36s)]
*  that I didn't anticipate how much Kamala Harris would be a galvanising force [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  and bring new energy, and you've been saying this for a few weeks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=90.12s)]
*  So certainly, I hope now she wins, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=93.76s)]
*  and then people like you would probably be vindicated, because you can't... [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=96.44s)]
*  Although she loses, people like me will probably be blamed. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=99.56s)]
*  There was... So on that note about his progressive record, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=102.56s)]
*  there was this fascinating dynamic in recent weeks, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  where you had centrist establishment Democrats, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=108.72s)]
*  like Nancy Pelosi working by in the scenes, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  Adam Schiff, Seth Moulton in public, calling for him to step down, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=113.48s)]
*  and then you have the left of the party, not just yourself, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=117.32s)]
*  but Senator Bernie Sanders, the Squad, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=119.64s)]
*  not just not calling for him to step down, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=123.28s)]
*  but pretty gung-ho saying he shouldn't step down [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=125.32s)]
*  and everyone should stop calling for him to step down. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=127.48s)]
*  Why do you think that was, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=129.96s)]
*  and do you think that's damaged the left's credibility? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=131.88s)]
*  Was it a bad judgment call to go all in on Biden? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=134.2s)]
*  No, I think it was for two philosophical reasons. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=137.0s)]
*  One, he was adopting progressive platforms, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=139.28s)]
*  and the left has always been about issues more than personality. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this was the critique of Bernie Sanders, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=144.28s)]
*  that he wouldn't talk about his family and his upbringing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=145.84s)]
*  It's all about issues. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  And so for the left, it was, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=149.92s)]
*  this president is moving further and further [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=151.68s)]
*  to adopting progressive issues. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=153.48s)]
*  And second, it was the type of people that were pushing him. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=154.92s)]
*  Now, I don't think it was some elite-driven issue. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=158.64s)]
*  There were a lot of voters who wanted him to step aside. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=160.95999999999998s)]
*  But the people who were putting the pressure were donors, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=164.12s)]
*  were consultants, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=167.04s)]
*  and the left had seen that with Bernie Sanders, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  and I think that was informing the decision [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=170.96s)]
*  that you can't just push someone out who had the vote. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  So I think those are the two reasons that people were saying, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=176.6s)]
*  it's his decision, but we're in it until he decides. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=179.0s)]
*  So let's talk Kamala Harris, your fellow California Democrat. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=182.4s)]
*  You've endorsed her. Of course. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=185.16s)]
*  Why? Why do you think she'll beat Donald Trump? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Why do you think she'll make a good, even great president? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, one, she has galvanised people. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=192.64000000000001s)]
*  You can see this, and you see already [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=195.24s)]
*  that she's getting young voters, she's getting progressives, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=197.84s)]
*  she's energising the party, she represents this sort of future, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=200.48s)]
*  she represents a generational change. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  And I do think that on some of the issues, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=207.12s)]
*  hopefully she will adopt the progressive direction [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  that President Biden was going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=211.92s)]
*  and adopt some progressive policies on the Middle East. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=213.56s)]
*  But I think she gives us a clean start [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  and has the opportunity to really galvanise [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=219.6s)]
*  the Obama-Bernie coalition. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=222.6s)]
*  So I want to come to Gaza, but just before that, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=224.88s)]
*  and you mentioned the importance of issues [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=227.72s)]
*  and progressive records, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=229.12s)]
*  what do you think Kamala Harris's politics are? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  They seem a little bit all over the place. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=233.52s)]
*  She was pretty neoliberal centrist as California AG, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=235.96s)]
*  as California senator, then she ran for president in 2020, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  and she was pretty left-wing. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  She was calling for Medicare for all and a Green New Deal. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  And then she ran as Biden's pretty mainstream centrist VP. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=247.48000000000002s)]
*  Can she continue what you've described as Biden's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=251.0s)]
*  very progressive record on the economy, on labour? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=253.28s)]
*  Well, I think this is a huge opportunity for her [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=256.32s)]
*  because now the country's going to want to know [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=258.6s)]
*  exactly her politics. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=260.20000000000005s)]
*  And there are going to be people like me and Sanders [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=261.44s)]
*  and others who are going to say, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=264.48s)]
*  let's continue on a bold progressive agenda, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=265.68s)]
*  come out for this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=268.72s)]
*  And there are going to be others [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=269.56s)]
*  in different wings of the party saying, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  no, just be the anti-Trump, just hit him on his... [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=272.52000000000004s)]
*  And pivot to the centre. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=276.04s)]
*  And pivot to the centre. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=277.04s)]
*  Classic, don't lie. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=278.04s)]
*  And really, it's going to be her call. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=279.12s)]
*  And so I, but I think we're going to get a very clear sense [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=280.92s)]
*  of what she's going to run on and what she's going to stand on. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=283.8s)]
*  Jonathan Chaite of New York Magazine has a piece out [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=287.16s)]
*  suggesting that what Kamala Harris needs to do now [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=290.48s)]
*  is persuade voters in the Rust Belt, in the swing states, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=294.4s)]
*  in the Michigan's and the Wisconsin's and the Pennsylvania's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=298.44s)]
*  that she's not too liberal. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=301.76s)]
*  What's your response to an argument like that? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, what does liberal mean in this context, right? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there is a consensus that even Trump and Vance [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=308.44s)]
*  are running on that the deindustrialisation [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=312.08s)]
*  has hurt voters, that corporate greed, offshore jobs. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=314.12s)]
*  And so does liberal mean the sort of neoliberal consensus [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=317.8s)]
*  that even Romney and Paul Ryan were for? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=321.24s)]
*  Because that's going to lose. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=324.12s)]
*  If liberalism means that she understands the hollowing out [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=325.71999999999997s)]
*  of the working and middle class and that she's going to focus [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=329.71999999999997s)]
*  on those regions coming back and the working class, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=332.08s)]
*  then I think she will win. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=335.0s)]
*  So I think that this liberal conservative dichotomy [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=336.0s)]
*  doesn't really have meaning in this context of the election. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=340.24s)]
*  It's weird, isn't it, because you say liberal, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=342.96000000000004s)]
*  and I actually think liberal is probably an unpopular word [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=345.08000000000004s)]
*  in a lot of those communities. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=347.88s)]
*  It's the right have done a good job of tainting that word. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=349.12s)]
*  But the policy proposals that come from liberals, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=352.04s)]
*  the people in these white working class communities [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=354.8s)]
*  support those policies overwhelmingly. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=356.32s)]
*  In fact, there was a recent poll, I think, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=358.24s)]
*  from YouGov, a blind poll, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=359.36s)]
*  where they polled Biden's policies versus Trump's policies [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=361.0s)]
*  without the names, and Republicans overwhelmingly [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=363.12s)]
*  supported Biden's policies more than Trump's. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=365.32s)]
*  And you've travelled in some of these states and communities. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=367.64s)]
*  What are you hearing from some of these working class [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=370.6s)]
*  communities about what they want? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=372.24s)]
*  Well, I think very simply to say you shouldn't be poor [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=373.24s)]
*  if you work in America. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=376.44s)]
*  This is why we need a higher wage. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  You should be able to look after your kids if they're sick. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=379.04s)]
*  This is why we need paid family leave. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  You should not have to pay 10,000 bucks a year for childcare. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=383.24s)]
*  This is why we need $10 a day childcare. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=386.6s)]
*  You should have some tax on these multibillionaires. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=389.24s)]
*  We don't demonise them, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=391.64000000000004s)]
*  but if they're making billions of dollars, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=393.36s)]
*  they can pay tax and a fair tax, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  and they shouldn't be paying less tax [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=397.16s)]
*  than teachers and janitors. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  This basic economic message, I think, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=400.16s)]
*  will resonate in these states, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=402.56s)]
*  and I think Kamala Harris can be a very forceful advocate for it [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  if she chooses to run on that issue. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=407.8s)]
*  Before we get to Gaza, just one last question [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=410.56s)]
*  on the actual process of what we've seen [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=412.84000000000003s)]
*  over the last few days. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=414.44000000000005s)]
*  She now says she has enough delegates. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=415.64000000000004s)]
*  What about the argument? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=418.88s)]
*  And the right are pushing this cynically, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=420.0s)]
*  but the argument still stands on its own merits, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=421.32000000000005s)]
*  that this is a coronation, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=424.56s)]
*  that this should have been an open convention, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=426.12s)]
*  the delegates should decide. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=428.64s)]
*  Obviously, the Republicans cynically calling it a coup, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=430.56s)]
*  but what about the argument [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=432.84s)]
*  that she never actually had to win any votes? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=433.76s)]
*  Well, she does. She's winning the delegate votes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=436.12s)]
*  In a primary, though. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=438.36s)]
*  She didn't run in the 2020 primary. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=439.56s)]
*  She didn't run in 2024 primary. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=441.24s)]
*  She's from a blue state. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=442.71999999999997s)]
*  She hasn't actually gone out to compete. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=443.8s)]
*  Well, she's winning these delegate votes, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=446.2s)]
*  and she's got universal votes from Texas. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=448.28s)]
*  Up against no one, though. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=449.84s)]
*  Well, people decided not to run against her [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=450.88s)]
*  because she was strong, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=452.76s)]
*  but technically, someone can still mount a challenge to her [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=453.92s)]
*  in terms of they care about Gaza, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=456.32s)]
*  they care about economic issues, I mean, they can run. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=457.96s)]
*  I guess what I would say is that it's very different [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  when you have a president who basically, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=463.76s)]
*  for capacity in terms of running issues, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  he's capable of serving, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=469.0s)]
*  but he said that I don't have the stamina to do it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=470.32s)]
*  Three months out, that's the job of the vice president. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=473.32s)]
*  It's not surprising that we would call less [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=476.0s)]
*  around the vice president in that kind of situation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=477.84s)]
*  So a big question on the left is, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=480.59999999999997s)]
*  can Kamala Harris turn the page on Gaza? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=482.88s)]
*  The president she served alongside for the last few years [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=485.84s)]
*  and over the last nine months [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=488.76s)]
*  has given unconditional support to Israel, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=490.4s)]
*  sold billions of dollars of weapons, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=492.28s)]
*  weapons that the Israelis have used to kill kids [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=494.12s)]
*  as recently as yesterday. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=496.32s)]
*  You've criticized that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=499.32s)]
*  You've criticized the Israeli actions. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=500.64s)]
*  Not just criticized, voted against the offensive weapons. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=502.52s)]
*  You voted against selling those offensive weapons. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  Is she tainted by the Biden administration's record on Gaza? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=507.15999999999997s)]
*  Can she somehow distance herself from that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=511.24s)]
*  Will she distance herself from that? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=513.7199999999999s)]
*  I think she can. I think there's a new start. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=515.76s)]
*  I think her decision not to go to the joint address [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=517.7199999999999s)]
*  by Netanyahu is a good start. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=521.4s)]
*  I think her message that when she meets with Netanyahu, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=524.16s)]
*  she's going to tell him to end the war is a good start. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  But I think ultimately it's going to be what she proposes. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=529.4799999999999s)]
*  Is she going to say that I am... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=532.12s)]
*  Talk is cheap. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=533.28s)]
*  I mean, I am willing to have conditions [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=534.4399999999999s)]
*  on giving offensive weapons [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=537.8399999999999s)]
*  and do not support giving offensive weapons [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=539.04s)]
*  while this war is going on. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=541.24s)]
*  Will you be pressuring her to do that? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=542.12s)]
*  Well, I'll be making the case to her, yes, absolutely, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  as the Progressive Caucus will be making the case to her. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=546.2s)]
*  That you tell me, you know the community as well as I do, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=548.64s)]
*  I don't think the symbolism is going to be enough. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  I think there's going to have to be one or two concrete policy [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=554.64s)]
*  proposals to show where it's going to be different going forward. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  Well, I've spoken to some of the uncommitted delegates [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=561.08s)]
*  out of places like Michigan, and they're going to the DNC, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=562.76s)]
*  and they still say, while they feel a little bit more positive, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=564.84s)]
*  what they're telling me off the record behind the scenes [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=567.88s)]
*  is they still want some tangible policy proposals, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=569.6800000000001s)]
*  especially on arms sales. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=572.68s)]
*  I mean, Congressman, the United States is giving weapons [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=573.68s)]
*  that are being dropped on people living in tents, 500-pound bombs, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=578.68s)]
*  which the ICC chief prosecutor says is a war crime, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=582.68s)]
*  which every human rights group in the world says is a war crime, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=585.08s)]
*  on what is, according to the ICJ on Friday, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=589.08s)]
*  occupied territory Gaza. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=591.68s)]
*  The US is complicit in war crimes, is it not? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=593.68s)]
*  Well, the US is complicit in a war [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=596.68s)]
*  that is a gross violation of humanitarian norms. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=599.28s)]
*  I mean, I'll leave it to the lawyers of what to call it, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=602.68s)]
*  but I voted, I was one of 37 Democrats [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=605.28s)]
*  who voted against the offensive weapons. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=608.68s)]
*  And you know what is sad, Mehdi, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=611.0799999999999s)]
*  is that it's not just all the children dying, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=613.48s)]
*  it's not just the women dying, it's also totally ineffective. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=617.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, Netanyahu is saying, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=620.68s)]
*  okay, I want to militarily eliminate Gaza, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=622.28s)]
*  I mean, Hamas from Gaza, he's going into Rafa, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=624.68s)]
*  and Hamas is popping up in northern Gaza. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=627.68s)]
*  And the reality is you cannot militarily eliminate [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  30,000 or 40,000 fighters. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=633.4799999999999s)]
*  So what we need is the release of the hostages of the ceasefire [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  and then a diplomatic effort to build a new Palestinian governance [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=637.88s)]
*  there with the recognition of a Palestinian state and a secure Israel. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=641.88s)]
*  And even if you did get rid of all those fighters, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=645.28s)]
*  the underlying ideology remains, the underlying grievance remains, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=647.28s)]
*  the underlying occupation remains, you'll just get Hamas 2.0, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=649.88s)]
*  like we got ISIS after al-Qaeda, we never learn. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=652.4799999999999s)]
*  Congressman, will you be attending [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=655.88s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu's speech on Wednesday? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=657.68s)]
*  No, I will not, because I'm not going to sit there [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=659.68s)]
*  and listen to a one-way lecture from the Prime Minister [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=661.68s)]
*  in a failed war strategy, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=665.28s)]
*  and I'm not going to have him insult the President, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=667.28s)]
*  which I'm sure he will find ways implicitly or explicitly to do. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=670.28s)]
*  Was it a mistake then for Senator Chuck Schumer [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=674.4799999999999s)]
*  and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=676.4799999999999s)]
*  both from your party, to cosign onto the invitation [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=678.28s)]
*  to have this man who is accused of war crimes, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  who the ICC chief prosecutor is requesting in a ramped war on four, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=683.68s)]
*  to come at their joint invitation with Speaker Mike Johnson [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=686.68s)]
*  and get their applause and standing ovations? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=689.68s)]
*  I do think it was a mistake, and the mistake is the timing. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  Look, I have been a person who says that foreign leaders, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=694.4799999999999s)]
*  if they're coming, if they're an ally, they should speak. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=697.68s)]
*  As you know, I've been critical of Modi, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=699.68s)]
*  but believed that Modi should address the Congress. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=701.68s)]
*  But here you have an ongoing war. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=704.28s)]
*  You've got people actually being killed, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=706.4799999999999s)]
*  and you've got Netanyahu defying the President. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=708.68s)]
*  In that context, I think it was perfectly appropriate [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=711.28s)]
*  for Senator Schumer or our speaker to be Jeffries to say, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=714.0799999999999s)]
*  not now, this is not the time. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  When the war ends, we can always have the Israeli prime minister. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=720.28s)]
*  Does this stuff happen, Congressman? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  A lot of our viewers, readers, listeners, subscribers, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=725.88s)]
*  they feel strongly about this, not just about the war itself, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=728.88s)]
*  but the way in which your body, Congress, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=731.28s)]
*  just rolls over time and again for Israel, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=733.68s)]
*  for Israeli governments, for pro-Israel lobbyists. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=737.68s)]
*  Is there a sense that your institution, your colleagues, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=741.68s)]
*  the United States Congress, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  just doesn't see Palestinians as human beings, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=746.68s)]
*  doesn't afford them the respect humanity, human rights, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=748.88s)]
*  that it gives to Ukrainians, for example? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=753.28s)]
*  I think we have work to do. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=755.88s)]
*  I mean, I believe that we have not yet recognised [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=757.68s)]
*  the self-determination of the Palestinian people [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=761.28s)]
*  and the dignity of the Palestinian people. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=763.4799999999999s)]
*  By definition, we have not recognised a Palestinian state. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=765.28s)]
*  143 other countries have. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=768.68s)]
*  And I believe you can recognise Jewish self-determination, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=770.88s)]
*  which means a secure Israel, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=773.88s)]
*  and also bilaterally recognise a Palestinian state. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=775.28s)]
*  And the United States should do that. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=778.88s)]
*  That, I think, would be an incredible thing [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=780.48s)]
*  if Vice President Harris were to say that. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=782.28s)]
*  In her first term, she will be working to join other countries [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=784.48s)]
*  in recognising a Palestinian state. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=789.28s)]
*  Congressman, you're a person of colour, as am I. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=792.48s)]
*  We're both of Indian origin, as is the Vice President, half. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=794.28s)]
*  How much racism and misogyny can she expect [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=798.48s)]
*  from the right going forward, from our media? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  We're already hearing Republicans dismiss her as the DEI candidate, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=804.88s)]
*  DEI being their polite and coded new version, I guess, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=808.48s)]
*  of saying the N-word. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=811.0799999999999s)]
*  What's she in store for? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=812.48s)]
*  I admire her as a trailblazer for this reason. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=815.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, she faced this when she ran for AG. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=817.48s)]
*  She faced it when she ran for the Senate. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=819.88s)]
*  She's going to face it now in her presidential campaign. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=821.28s)]
*  I'm sure she faced it earlier. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=823.88s)]
*  But I think Republicans will overplay their hands. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=825.28s)]
*  I mean, I, on a personal level, and for the country, hope they don't do it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=828.28s)]
*  But if they run that campaign, that will be like the DeSantis campaign. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=831.28s)]
*  I mean, he was the DEI candidate going after Mickey Mouse and Disney. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=834.88s)]
*  That's not a winning campaign. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=838.28s)]
*  Donald Trump won because he wasn't just that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=840.08s)]
*  He had an economic message. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=841.88s)]
*  It was a terribly false message. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=843.68s)]
*  But people saw him as a billionaire. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=845.68s)]
*  They thought, OK, he's going to help them get rich. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=847.08s)]
*  And if the Republicans get sidetracked and start to talk about [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=849.08s)]
*  Kamala Harris's race and gender, I think it could actually backfire with the swing voters. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=852.88s)]
*  They would be far smarter to run on inflation and the border and other things as opposed to [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=857.88s)]
*  Don't give them ideas. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=862.88s)]
*  I don't think they can help themselves. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=865.88s)]
*  I think it's like the scorpion and the frog. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=867.4799999999999s)]
*  It's who they are. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=870.0799999999999s)]
*  Trump couldn't help himself at his conventions, which he had to literally stand up there and say, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=870.88s)]
*  thank you. I feel a changed person for being shot. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=874.88s)]
*  I want to bring the country back together for 10 minutes. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=877.28s)]
*  And he couldn't help himself. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=880.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't think they'll be able to help themselves with the racism and the misogyny because it's who they are. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=881.48s)]
*  But you're right. It may hurt them with swing voters, but it'll obviously be outrageous and disgusting to see. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=885.08s)]
*  Some Democrats, congressmen like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitman, have indicated that they won't be her running mate. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=889.48s)]
*  Is that because they think she can run now and lose to Trump and then they can run in 2028 untainted by the Biden record and not against Donald Trump? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=895.08s)]
*  Are we even going to have a 2028 election? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=904.08s)]
*  I keep saying the same thing. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=906.28s)]
*  I'm glad we're on the same page. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=907.68s)]
*  Look, I understand why Gavin wouldn't want to be the running mate. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=910.28s)]
*  I mean, two Californians just doesn't make sense. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=912.88s)]
*  I personally think it would be fabulous to have Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitman, two women, as a contrast. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=915.48s)]
*  In a Dobs year? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=921.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a little unconventional, but I think they're going to go all out for her. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=922.88s)]
*  I don't think it's that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=927.28s)]
*  I think they probably just think it's going to be someone like a Bashir or a Cooper or a Kelly and are realistic and don't want their names. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  A white man? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=935.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean... [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=935.68s)]
*  A DEI candidate in reverse. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=936.68s)]
*  Well, to assure the nation. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=938.68s)]
*  I mean, a Joe Biden like candidate. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=940.28s)]
*  Joe Biden like candidate. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=941.68s)]
*  What a sad country it is that we have to assure the nation. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=942.68s)]
*  People have talked about you running for president one day. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=945.28s)]
*  I'm young. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=948.0799999999999s)]
*  I like to think I'm young. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=949.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'll take that as a yes. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=950.4799999999999s)]
*  You are thinking about that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=952.4799999999999s)]
*  Not... [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=953.68s)]
*  Here's what I say to that. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=955.0799999999999s)]
*  We didn't know who the nominee would be until three weeks out, let alone 10 years out. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=955.88s)]
*  That is a good line that politicians like yourself can now use to deflect. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=961.0799999999999s)]
*  We'll decide three months before the 2028 election. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=964.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=967.28s)]
*  Last question. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=968.28s)]
*  On a separate issue, you were one of the members of Congress who grilled the Secret Service director this week, Kimberly Cheadle, over the Secret Service's failure to prevent the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania earlier this month. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=969.28s)]
*  She has now quit. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=981.28s)]
*  You spoke to her in Congress and she didn't sound like she was going to quit. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=982.88s)]
*  You asked her to resign. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=985.88s)]
*  You basically said she should. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=987.0799999999999s)]
*  Why do you think she took so long to resign? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=988.28s)]
*  How bad was the security failure? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=991.28s)]
*  And why didn't Joe Biden just fire her? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=993.68s)]
*  Well, he should have fired her or asked her to resign. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=996.08s)]
*  It was a terribly bad failure. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=998.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think she probably looked at it saying, look, I've given honorable service for 29 years. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1000.6800000000001s)]
*  I personally didn't make a mistake. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  I want to help fix this. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1007.6800000000001s)]
*  And I understand from a personal perspective, I don't think she's a bad person. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1009.2800000000001s)]
*  But what she didn't realize is, well, she's lost the confidence of the country. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1012.88s)]
*  And that's different than you did something poorly. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1016.2800000000001s)]
*  Sometimes that just happens and you need someone at the time of all these conspiracy theories, right? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1019.48s)]
*  I mean, on the extreme left, you're having people say crazy things like it was staged. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1024.48s)]
*  On the extreme right, you have people saying crazy things like somehow this was an inside job. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1028.08s)]
*  At that time, you need someone who has the trust of the country. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1032.28s)]
*  And that's what I was trying to say to her. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1036.08s)]
*  And I'm glad I think she did get the message from Congress. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1039.08s)]
*  She clearly got the message from you. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1041.88s)]
*  It wasn't just Republicans, it's Democrats like yourself saying it. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1043.28s)]
*  But you sit on the House Armed Services Committee. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1045.88s)]
*  You've been in Congress for a while now. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1048.08s)]
*  I mean, were you not amazed that there's a shooter on a roof with a clear line of sight [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1050.08s)]
*  and they haven't secured the roof and they're not stopping him when they've seen him? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1053.88s)]
*  The whole thing is bizarre. You'd have to be a conspiracy theorist to say, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1057.0800000000002s)]
*  that's a bizarre chain of events that went down on Saturday. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1059.68s)]
*  Look, I think the Secret Service has an incredibly difficult job. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1062.88s)]
*  I mean, they can't be wrong even once. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  And so I understand that it's a hard job. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1068.2800000000002s)]
*  But if they need more resources, come to Congress. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1071.48s)]
*  We've got a trillion dollar defense budget. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1073.68s)]
*  And you're telling me we can't give you a couple more billion to protect our leaders. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1075.2800000000002s)]
*  So if that's the issue, come to Congress. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1078.68s)]
*  But they need to have an assessment so that this never happens again. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1081.48s)]
*  And look, we have a history, Betty, unfortunately, of political violence in this country. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1084.68s)]
*  I know we say that we don't, but Dr. King, Malcolm X, Bobby Kennedy, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1088.8799999999999s)]
*  shots against Ford, shots against Reagan, now shots against President Trump. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1094.68s)]
*  That's a lot of incidents in the last 50 years. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1098.68s)]
*  On that note, just to end the interview, sorry to end it on a dark note, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1102.48s)]
*  but you've reminded me of this. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1105.48s)]
*  I mean, we joked earlier about will there even be an election in 28? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1107.08s)]
*  We have an authoritarian running for president. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1110.08s)]
*  Many would say a neo-fascist. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1112.28s)]
*  He's talked openly about wanting to be a dictator. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1113.8799999999999s)]
*  He's talked openly about, I want to have a third term because I was robbed of my first term. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1116.6799999999998s)]
*  He's talked about canceling the Constitution, terminating the Constitution, his words. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1120.8799999999999s)]
*  And of course, proud boys stand back and stand by, etc., etc. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1125.6799999999998s)]
*  Overnight, he was posting quotes from Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1130.08s)]
*  on his Truth Social just a few hours ago. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1134.6799999999998s)]
*  Regardless of whether he wins or loses in November, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1137.88s)]
*  can we expect violence in this country, more political violence? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1139.68s)]
*  I fear it. I fear it. I fear it on either end. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1142.68s)]
*  And that's what we have to understand is the stakes of the election. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1147.48s)]
*  So we need to win because ultimately Trumpism has to be defeated. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1152.2800000000002s)]
*  And this is something to rise beyond ourselves. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1156.68s)]
*  And I'm glad that Gretchen Whitmer and Shapiro and Newsom all put their own ambitions aside [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1159.2800000000002s)]
*  and came together, recognizing that threat. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1163.48s)]
*  But then afterwards, we've got to figure out how we start to tone down the rhetoric [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1167.08s)]
*  and stitch the country back together. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1170.6799999999998s)]
*  And that's going to be a generational challenge that will take all of us. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1172.28s)]
*  But it's a very, very difficult time for our democracy. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1175.08s)]
*  But the one thing that I will say is we're trying to do something very difficult [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1178.28s)]
*  to become a cohesive, multiracial democracy with people from around the world. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1181.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not an easy project. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1185.6799999999998s)]
*  It's not easy to imagine Indian Americans of Hindu faith in Congress [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1187.8799999999999s)]
*  and an African American, Indian American woman running for president. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1193.68s)]
*  So I understand that this is not going to be a linear line to a cohesive, multiracial democracy. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1197.0800000000002s)]
*  It's hard. It'll have to be earned. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1202.68s)]
*  And as Indian Americans, an exciting week for us, I think, regardless of anything else. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1204.88s)]
*  It is an incredible week, an incredible week. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1209.88s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for your time. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1212.68s)]
*  Thank you. Appreciate it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1213.88s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLxeeY8xgDc&t=1215.0800000000002s)]
