Video Description: “This is going to be [Biden’s] lasting legacy and in a large part is one of the reasons that we have Trump sitting here today… The reality is we wouldn't be where we are now had Biden not made those decisions… The Democratic Party needs to be held accountable and if that means that we are now in a situation, you know, so be it under Trump…”

Palestinian journalist Laila El-Haddad joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss her confrontation with Israeli Minister of National Security, Itamar Ben-Gvir’s visit to the United States Capitol. She also shares her thoughts on the crackdown on pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campuses and how the Gaza genocide will be Biden’s lasting legacy, as well as how Biden’s failure is why Trump is in office.

# Biden’s FAILURE is Why Trump is in Office
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM)
*  Itamar Ben-Gavir, Israel's far-right extremist minister of national security who has been convicted of at least eight crimes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=0.0s)]
*  including incitement to racism, and supporting a terrorist organization, recently paid a visit to the United States. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=6.72s)]
*  He spoke at an event near Yale University in an appearance that Guardian columnist Arwa Madawi considered an explicit endorsement by the school. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=12.8s)]
*  She wrote in a recent piece, if Ben-Gavir were a Palestinian, every single politician and media outlet would be in an uproar that he was anywhere near Yale. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=20.6s)]
*  Ben-Gavir also went to the Capitol, where he was welcomed with open arms by several Republican members of Congress, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=28.52s)]
*  including Brian Maass, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=33.96s)]
*  While inside the Capitol, Ben-Gavir just happened to cross paths with a group of pro-Palestine activists. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=38.04s)]
*  Let's take a look at what happened. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=44.44s)]

*  We were actually there with the USCMO, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=145.8s)]
*  the largest umbrella group [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=147.8s)]
*  of Muslim organizations for their [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=149.8s)]
*  annual Muslim, 10th annual Muslim [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=151.8s)]
*  Lobby Day. And we were with [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=153.8s)]
*  our Maryland delegation in a sort of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=155.8s)]
*  nondescript hallway of the Rayburn building [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=157.8s)]
*  to meet with one of our representatives, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=159.8s)]
*  I think it was, I can't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=161.8s)]
*  even remember offhand, but [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=163.8s)]
*  Raskin's office. And [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=165.8s)]
*  we were, I don't know, on the second floor, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=167.8s)]
*  and we just turned the hallway [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=169.8s)]
*  and happened to run into him. There was [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=171.8s)]
*  nobody there. We happened to run into him in his security [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=173.8s)]
*  detail. And of course, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=175.8s)]
*  Melissa Kronfeld, who's a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=177.8s)]
*  well-known extremist who has called openly [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=179.8s)]
*  for the destruction of the Al-Aqsa [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=181.8s)]
*  mosque. And [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=183.8s)]
*  there was just a moment, I think, of stunned silence [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=185.8s)]
*  on behalf of the group. We looked at each other [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=187.8s)]
*  and... Is it Ben Gavir? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=189.8s)]
*  And, exactly, I mean, I knew immediately who it was. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=191.8s)]
*  But I think [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=193.8s)]
*  others were, others might [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=195.8s)]
*  not have. And then someone said, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=197.8s)]
*  that's Ben Gavir. And then I just sort of [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=199.8s)]
*  instinctively took out my phone and started recording. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=201.8s)]
*  In that video, we hear protesters [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=203.8s)]
*  in your group calling Ben Gavir a war criminal [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=205.8s)]
*  while he shouts at all of you to go back. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=207.8s)]
*  In your Instagram post, you [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=209.8s)]
*  wrote, this is the face of apartheid, walking freely [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=211.8s)]
*  through the halls of American power. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=213.8s)]
*  I have to ask, what was that moment like [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=215.8s)]
*  for you, as someone [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=217.8s)]
*  whose family's from Gaza, as [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=219.8s)]
*  someone who's been protesting the genocide for [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=221.8s)]
*  the last 18 months or more, to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=223.8s)]
*  see this almost [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=225.8s)]
*  cartoon character villain off of our television [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=227.8s)]
*  sets, right there, in the flesh, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=229.8s)]
*  in your, in our [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=231.8s)]
*  Congress? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=233.8s)]
*  Yeah, cartoon character is [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=235.8s)]
*  right. I mean, it was unnerving. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=237.8s)]
*  I think, initially, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=239.8s)]
*  you know, I personally wasn't [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=241.8s)]
*  sure what to do. I didn't, I know we [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=243.8s)]
*  were there as part of a group, so I didn't really want to [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=245.8s)]
*  interrupt that. I didn't know what the protocol was. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=247.8s)]
*  But, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=249.8s)]
*  but I think [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=251.8s)]
*  we also felt that we had a certain [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=253.8s)]
*  responsibility to kind of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=255.8s)]
*  call him out. And [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=257.8s)]
*  this wasn't anything organized. It was very [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=259.8s)]
*  spontaneous. And [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=261.8s)]
*  I think that was the beauty of it, is that sort of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=263.8s)]
*  together, we wasn't anything, we all [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=265.8s)]
*  sort of in synchrony began to say, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=267.8s)]
*  war criminal, a genocider, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=269.8s)]
*  and then I personally [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=271.8s)]
*  looked at him and said, you were responsible [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=273.8s)]
*  for killing my family members in Gaza. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=275.8s)]
*  And, of course, he was shouting back [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=277.8s)]
*  at us. And he had to be restrained because he was trying [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=279.8s)]
*  to lunge at us. And there was actually one young [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=281.8s)]
*  girl working [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=283.8s)]
*  with CARE, a very young, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=285.8s)]
*  who had flown in from New York, and [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=287.8s)]
*  Melissa herself came, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=289.8s)]
*  pointed at her, shouted at her, threatened her, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=291.8s)]
*  called her a terrorist. And [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=293.8s)]
*  she sort of held her ground and said, I'm not afraid [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=295.8s)]
*  of you, I'm not afraid of you. There was, there was [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=297.8s)]
*  even, you know, I want to say, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=299.8s)]
*  what would be known as a mischief auntie, who's now [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=301.8s)]
*  become my personal superhero, who's there on the [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=303.8s)]
*  front lines, you can see her from the back, who was [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=305.8s)]
*  pointing at him and telling him, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=307.8s)]
*  you know, you are a war criminal, you are a war criminal, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=309.8s)]
*  go back home. And after that, I just had [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=311.8s)]
*  a newfound respect for her, she's one of my neighbours. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=313.8s)]
*  I mean, he's a thug. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=315.8s)]
*  He's been convicted in Israeli courts. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=317.8s)]
*  But the only [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=319.8s)]
*  democracy in the Middle East made him the National [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=321.8s)]
*  Security Minister appropriately. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=323.8s)]

*  to the capital. It's called the West Bank [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=347.8s)]
*  Violence Prevention Act. And in a press [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=349.8s)]
*  release, Congressman Nadler [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=351.8s)]
*  had some pretty strong words for Ben Gevi, called him a racist, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=353.8s)]
*  terrorist, Jewish supremacist [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=355.8s)]
*  and an insider in chief of settler violence [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=357.8s)]
*  in the West Bank. Rep Nadler [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=359.8s)]
*  is a long-time Jewish supporter of Israeli [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=361.8s)]
*  Congress. What is your response [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=363.8s)]
*  to hearing about that bill and Nadler's [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=365.8s)]
*  denunciation of Ben Gevi? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=367.8s)]
*  I mean, it's, I think, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=369.8s)]
*  more, this was someone who by his [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=371.8s)]
*  own admission said that he was [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=373.8s)]
*  a persona non grata prior [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=375.8s)]
*  to this administration. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=377.8s)]
*  And even though Trump [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=379.8s)]
*  didn't meet with him, he was still allowed. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=381.8s)]
*  This is someone who was openly called for the [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=383.8s)]
*  ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=385.8s)]
*  the destruction of Al-Aqsa [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=387.8s)]
*  and defended, you know, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=389.8s)]
*  Israeli soldiers who [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=391.8s)]
*  raped Palestinians. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=393.8s)]
*  And yet he's allowed to walk freely [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=395.8s)]
*  here in our halls of Congress. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=397.8s)]
*  As a VIP guest. As a VIP guest, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=399.8s)]
*  absolutely. I think that was probably the most [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=401.8s)]
*  stunning part of it all. And he wasn't [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=403.8s)]
*  just in Congress meeting with Republicans [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=405.8s)]
*  like Brian Maast, who wear Israeli military [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=407.8s)]
*  uniforms to work. He was also [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=409.8s)]
*  at an event near Yale University. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=411.8s)]
*  And we have, I mean, to be clear, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=413.8s)]
*  the group he spoke to, Shabta, is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=415.8s)]
*  based at Yale. It's not officially affiliated with [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=417.8s)]
*  the university. But it is [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=419.8s)]
*  amazing that we have had over a year [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=421.8s)]
*  of discourse in our media and in our [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=423.8s)]
*  politics about extremism on campus, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=425.8s)]
*  the safety of students, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=427.8s)]
*  bigotry, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=429.8s)]
*  and yet Ben Gavir can [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=431.8s)]
*  come and speak. A man who, before he went [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=433.8s)]
*  there, went to Mar-a-Lago and said, you know, I'm all [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=435.8s)]
*  in favor of bombing aid depots. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=437.8s)]
*  Right. And he said it again about five hours ago, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=439.8s)]
*  by the way. He said that we should bomb [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=441.8s)]
*  them. And yet he's allowed to turn [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=443.8s)]
*  up at Yale. But Jewish [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=445.8s)]
*  students protesting genocide are having [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=447.8s)]
*  their courses canceled, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=449.8s)]
*  having their degrees rescinded, etc., [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=451.8s)]
*  etc. Right. I mean, and this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=453.8s)]
*  is, unfortunately, the reality [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=455.8s)]
*  that we live in. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=457.8s)]
*  And that needs to be called out, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=459.8s)]
*  right? There's just no other way to put it. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=461.8s)]
*  I think that was in part [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=463.8s)]
*  why we were so sort of stunned into silence [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=465.8s)]
*  initially, is this is really happening. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=467.8s)]
*  It almost feels like we're living in a [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=469.8s)]
*  twilight zone. But again, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=471.8s)]
*  I just do want to say it also, I think, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=473.8s)]
*  we felt like we were sort of put in this [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=475.8s)]
*  position. Call it what you will, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=477.8s)]
*  divide intervention, to be able to [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=479.8s)]
*  speak out. And also, I think, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=481.8s)]
*  to demonstrate to so many others [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=483.8s)]
*  who are genuinely and truly afraid, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=485.8s)]
*  who might be more vulnerable, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=487.8s)]
*  whose whatever [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=489.8s)]
*  documentation they may have [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=491.8s)]
*  make them more vulnerable, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=493.8s)]
*  not to sort of succumb [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=495.8s)]
*  to this [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=497.8s)]
*  tyranny and to feel that [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=499.8s)]
*  it's okay to speak out, especially if you [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=501.8s)]
*  are put in such a position. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=503.8s)]
*  I mean, it appears the only group of people who have faced any [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=505.8s)]
*  consequences for Ben Gavir's appearance [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=507.8s)]
*  at the event near Yale are the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=509.8s)]
*  pro-Palestinian students who protested. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=511.8s)]
*  The university has threatened them with disciplinary [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=513.8s)]
*  action, revoked their status as a registered student [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=515.8s)]
*  organization, said they're investigating [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=517.8s)]
*  concerns about disturbing anti-Semitic conduct. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=519.8s)]
*  What is your response [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=521.8s)]
*  to the continued crackdown [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=523.8s)]
*  on pro-Palestine protests on campus [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=525.8s)]
*  which began under the Democrats [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=527.8s)]
*  and have now, now on steroids [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=529.8s)]
*  under the Republicans? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=531.8s)]
*  I think that we sort of saw [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=533.8s)]
*  the wheels in motion. We saw [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=535.8s)]
*  this happening, as you said, under the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=537.8s)]
*  Biden administration. So I think it [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=539.8s)]
*  should come as no surprises, and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=541.8s)]
*  it's going to start now [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=543.8s)]
*  with the Palestinians and those [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=545.8s)]
*  supportive of justice and [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=547.8s)]
*  of, you know, who are anti-genocide [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=549.8s)]
*  and so forth. But it's going [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=551.8s)]
*  to, I mean, this is a litmus test, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=553.8s)]
*  It's going to go on from there and it will include [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=555.8s)]
*  other groups if people [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=557.8s)]
*  don't intervene now and put an end to this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=559.8s)]
*  Am I correct in saying that you actually took action against the [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=561.8s)]
*  Biden-Harris administration over the [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=563.8s)]
*  aid situation? Not over the aid. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=565.8s)]
*  I was a [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=567.8s)]
*  plaintiff who, one of [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=569.8s)]
*  several others, including DCI, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=571.8s)]
*  who sued [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=573.8s)]
*  Defense for Children International Palestine [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=575.8s)]
*  and other Palestinian [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=577.8s)]
*  plaintiffs who sued Biden, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=579.8s)]
*  Blinken and Austin for their complicity in genocide [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=581.8s)]
*  and failure to prevent an ongoing [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=583.8s)]
*  genocide. What happened to that suit? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=585.8s)]
*  As to be [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=587.8s)]
*  expected, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=589.8s)]
*  they ruled that the courts [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=591.8s)]
*  had no place when it came to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=593.8s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=595.8s)]
*  But the federal [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=597.8s)]
*  judge presiding over that case [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=599.8s)]
*  came out forcefully and said it was [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=601.8s)]
*  everyone's obligation to put an end to the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=603.8s)]
*  ongoing military siege of Gaza. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=605.8s)]
*  And he [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=607.8s)]
*  pushed the Biden administration to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=609.8s)]
*  reflect and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=611.8s)]
*  questioned their policies, their ongoing [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=613.8s)]
*  policies. What do you think should happen [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=615.8s)]
*  to Joe Biden, Antibes, Blinken, Jake Sullivan, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=617.8s)]
*  these people who are going to go, Sullivan's now at Harvard, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=619.8s)]
*  Biden's going to build a library. Oh man, you're opening up all these wounds, Maddie. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=621.8s)]
*  I mean, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=623.8s)]
*  on the one hand, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=625.8s)]
*  people who know me and know my views, I've always [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=627.8s)]
*  said that Trump would be worse and he [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=629.8s)]
*  is worse, but that doesn't give a pass to [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=631.8s)]
*  what Biden and these people do. Absolutely not. I know we've discussed [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=633.8s)]
*  this before as well. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=635.8s)]
*  And them getting into private life and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=637.8s)]
*  Biden's going to build a library and I think [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=639.8s)]
*  Jake Sullivan's now at Harvard as the Henry Kissinger [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=641.8s)]
*  professor, which is rather appropriate. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=643.8s)]
*  Do you think this will [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=645.8s)]
*  slash should follow them around [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=647.8s)]
*  for the rest of their professional lives? Oh, absolutely. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=649.8s)]
*  Absolutely. And I think he's [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=651.8s)]
*  going to go down in history [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=653.8s)]
*  as the first president, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=655.8s)]
*  the only president that was [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=657.8s)]
*  tried for genocide. This is going [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=659.8s)]
*  to be his lasting legacy. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=661.8s)]
*  And in a large part, is one of the reasons [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=663.8s)]
*  that we have Trump sitting here [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=665.8s)]
*  today. And so I think [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=667.8s)]
*  it's incumbent upon [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=669.8s)]
*  all of us to continue to push back [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=671.8s)]
*  against this and to... The [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=673.8s)]
*  bulwark just did a piece [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=675.8s)]
*  which has caused a lot of people to get [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=677.8s)]
*  upset where they interviewed [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=679.8s)]
*  people from the uncommitted movement and the abandoned [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=681.8s)]
*  Biden movement and said, do you have any regrets [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=683.8s)]
*  now that Trump is presiding over famine [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=685.8s)]
*  and possibly ethnic cleansing, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=687.8s)]
*  which is coming down the line very fast. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=689.8s)]
*  Well, not famine to be [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=691.8s)]
*  clear, right? Deliberate starvation. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=693.8s)]
*  Deliberate starvation. Well put. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=695.8s)]
*  A man made famine. They [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=697.8s)]
*  said no and a lot of liberals are upset. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=699.8s)]
*  Where do you stand on that whole thorny [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=701.8s)]
*  debate? They said no to what? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=703.8s)]
*  They said no, they don't have regrets for the stances [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=705.8s)]
*  that they took. And I [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=707.8s)]
*  just wonder where you stand on that given [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=709.8s)]
*  since we're going to reopen all issues. I'm [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=711.8s)]
*  just interested in knowing. A lot of our viewers will be interested to know [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=713.8s)]
*  because they sympathize [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=715.8s)]
*  with what you're saying. I'm sure many people would say [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=717.8s)]
*  you're right, what Biden did was outrageous. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=719.8s)]
*  But they're also focused on what Trump is doing now [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=721.8s)]
*  and saying, but it's so bad what he's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=723.8s)]
*  doing now. As you say, Ben Gavir was persona [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=725.8s)]
*  non grata even under Biden and Blinken. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=727.8s)]
*  Now he's welcomed by the Republican Party. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=729.8s)]
*  Where do you stand on that whole thorny debate of [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=731.8s)]
*  where we are now compared to where we [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=733.8s)]
*  were last year? I mean the reality is we [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=735.8s)]
*  wouldn't be where we are now [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=737.8s)]
*  had Biden not [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=739.8s)]
*  made those decisions or not [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=741.8s)]
*  made those decisions if you will. And [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=743.8s)]
*  so no, I too don't regret. I mean I [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=745.8s)]
*  have again the luxury of living [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=747.8s)]
*  in a state in Maryland where it didn't really matter [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=749.8s)]
*  much and I understand that others who were in swing [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=751.8s)]
*  states. But it also became [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=753.8s)]
*  clear Gaza wasn't the sole issue. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=755.8s)]
*  So it's not as though one can point and say [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=757.8s)]
*  aha, it's your fault that this happened. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=759.8s)]
*  And I think this tends to happen, right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=761.8s)]
*  Our communities are the ones [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=765.8s)]
*  that are always thrown under the bus. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=767.8s)]
*  And not even just by our communities, I mean [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=769.8s)]
*  Muslim communities, people of color, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=771.8s)]
*  people who are supportive of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=773.8s)]
*  Palestine and so on and so forth. But no, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=775.8s)]
*  I don't regret that decision. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=777.8s)]
*  I think that the burden [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=779.8s)]
*  shouldn't be on us. It should be [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=781.8s)]
*  the Democratic Party needs to be [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=783.8s)]
*  held accountable. And if [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=785.8s)]
*  that means that we are now in a situation, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=787.8s)]
*  so be it, under Trump. It's just kind of, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=789.8s)]
*  I think, to me [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=791.8s)]
*  I see this as a chickens coming [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=793.8s)]
*  home to roost kind of moment. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=795.8s)]
*  Yeah, I guess [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=797.8s)]
*  it's interesting, it's an interesting conversation [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=799.8s)]
*  because you write about the scapegoating. I guess [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=801.8s)]
*  the politics of it is that Democrats [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=803.8s)]
*  will always say, well these people don't count, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=805.8s)]
*  we can ignore them. But you're to blame for losing [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=807.8s)]
*  the election. But then they would say, on the other [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=809.8s)]
*  hand, some of the activists [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=811.8s)]
*  were saying, we're going to defeat Biden and then he's defeated [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=813.8s)]
*  and say, well don't blame us. So it works. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=815.8s)]
*  I guess both sides are using [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=817.8s)]
*  different strategies. Sure. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=819.8s)]
*  All I can say is, as a Palestinian [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=821.8s)]
*  who is directly [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=823.8s)]
*  impacted by this genocide, whose family continues [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=825.8s)]
*  to be genocided, who are [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=827.8s)]
*  surviving, if that, on one meal [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=829.8s)]
*  a day right now, I mean, I could go on and on. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=831.8s)]
*  It was a genocide under Biden, it was a genocide under Trump. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=833.8s)]
*  There is, yeah, there is no [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=835.8s)]
*  way I could have lived with myself. I mean, this [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=837.8s)]
*  was literally their only ask of me. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=839.8s)]
*  And continues to be their only ask. Hold these people [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=841.8s)]
*  to account. Take them to court. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=843.8s)]
*  I think that's the way I would [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=845.8s)]
*  speak out, even if it means it's difficult [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=847.8s)]
*  and even if it means you're scared. If you have a vote, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=849.8s)]
*  use that vote. Not to put back [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=851.8s)]
*  in position the same people in power. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=853.8s)]
*  And I understand what [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=855.8s)]
*  that ultimately means. Yes. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=857.8s)]
*  But that's the way that I chose [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=859.8s)]
*  to exercise my right to vote [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=861.8s)]
*  and the power that I had. Whatever little power. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=863.8s)]
*  Understand. Explain to some of our [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=865.8s)]
*  viewers who might say, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=867.8s)]
*  well, and the Bulwark piece raises this issue, so I just want to give you a chance [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=869.8s)]
*  as someone who's a prominent activist and has [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=871.8s)]
*  been to Gaza to explain, some people are saying, well, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=873.8s)]
*  you know, Biden got protested everywhere [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=875.8s)]
*  and Trump doesn't. What actions [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=877.8s)]
*  are you taking as an activist right now [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=879.8s)]
*  with Trump doing [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=881.8s)]
*  this ethnic cleansing plan? You know, who's talking [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=883.8s)]
*  about flattening Gaza and moving all the people [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=885.8s)]
*  to another country. What is the pro-Palestine [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=887.8s)]
*  movement doing right now to try and [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=889.8s)]
*  stop that? I mean, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=891.8s)]
*  you know, I wear a lot of different hats. I wouldn't say, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=893.8s)]
*  you know, activist isn't the main [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=895.8s)]
*  one. I too, you know, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=897.8s)]
*  work in media. But you gave the example of the lawsuit, for example. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=899.8s)]
*  For sure. For sure. For sure. What steps can people take now? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=901.8s)]
*  Because people do feel, not just on Gaza, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=903.8s)]
*  with Trump, they feel powerless on a whole range of issues. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=905.8s)]
*  They feel powerless. Deportations. Yes. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=907.8s)]
*  So, on the Palestine issue. They feel demoralized. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=909.8s)]
*  Agreed. On the Palestine issue, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=911.8s)]
*  what do you think can be done? How do you offer people hope when they say, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=913.8s)]
*  what can we do to stop this shit? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=915.8s)]
*  Yes. I mean, the first message [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=917.8s)]
*  I have for people is that you [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=919.8s)]
*  have to think about the long game. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=921.8s)]
*  And that, I believe you once [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=923.8s)]
*  said, gave an example of [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=925.8s)]
*  the ants, if I'm not mistaken. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=927.8s)]
*  Was it the ants or the birds? Not the birds. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=929.8s)]
*  The birds in the story of Abraham. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=931.8s)]
*  In which we're not judged [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=933.8s)]
*  by the results. You do things because [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=935.8s)]
*  you're expected to, because it's a moral duty, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=937.8s)]
*  because it's a sacred duty and a sacred charge. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=939.8s)]
*  That's my stance. That always has [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=941.8s)]
*  been. And that's my message to people. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=943.8s)]
*  If you're going to sit here and say, I didn't get [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=945.8s)]
*  an immediate result, then, you know, you're going to be in [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=947.8s)]
*  for a big surprise. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=949.8s)]
*  It has to be a multi-pronged approach. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=951.8s)]
*  That's always been my approach. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=953.8s)]
*  Both with Biden and with Trump. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=955.8s)]
*  I think we just have to shift and change it a little bit. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=957.8s)]
*  I think there is fatigue. There is fear. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=959.8s)]
*  But that's when being able to [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=961.8s)]
*  consult and collaborate with other groups [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=963.8s)]
*  and having that kind of approach and thinking about the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=965.8s)]
*  long game and thinking about sustained engagement [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=967.8s)]
*  as well. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=969.8s)]
*  So it has to be both, yes, at grassroots, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=971.8s)]
*  but if you're also mobilizing people to engage [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=973.8s)]
*  with your elected [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=975.8s)]
*  representatives, it might feel futile right now. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=977.8s)]
*  Some people just don't believe in that. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=979.8s)]
*  But being able, especially if you have [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=981.8s)]
*  a newly elected representative, in our case [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=983.8s)]
*  in the House of Representatives, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=985.8s)]
*  we had a call about, okay, how can we [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=987.8s)]
*  continue to engage with her early on? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=989.8s)]
*  She's just been elected. She's a junior senator [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=991.8s)]
*  every couple of weeks rather than just kind of [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=993.8s)]
*  a one-off meeting once a year. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=995.8s)]
*  You're also lucky to have Chris Van Hollen, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=997.8s)]
*  who relatively is much better on this issue than a lot of senators. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=999.8s)]
*  He is. But I will say, even on that, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1001.8s)]
*  I do give that as a good case study [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1003.8s)]
*  because very early on, he [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1005.8s)]
*  wasn't calling for a ceasefire, and we expected [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1007.8s)]
*  him to, and we pushed him, and we pushed him, and we met [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1009.8s)]
*  with him multiple times. And he kept [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1011.8s)]
*  insisting, I can put amendments to the bills, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1013.8s)]
*  I can do this, that, and the other. And we would just say, well, what if [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1015.8s)]
*  Biden bypasses them, which he ultimately did. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1017.8s)]
*  And then we [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1019.8s)]
*  had to resort to some disruption. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1021.8s)]
*  So it's just a combination of things that all work, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1023.8s)]
*  I think, together. There's lots of different [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1025.8s)]
*  tools at our disposal, and [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1027.8s)]
*  that's what we have to, I think, think about that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1029.8s)]
*  bigger picture. One last question. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1031.8s)]
*  The entire discourse about [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1033.8s)]
*  Gaza goes back to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1035.8s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1037.8s)]
*  And people who are supporters of the Palestinian cause [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1039.8s)]
*  and who understand history will say, the world did not begin [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1041.8s)]
*  on October 7th. The horrors of October 7th, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1043.8s)]
*  no one is excusing or defending. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1045.8s)]
*  But that wasn't the first day of the conflict [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1047.8s)]
*  in the region. Correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1049.8s)]
*  you were in Gaza during Kars-led, I believe. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1051.8s)]
*  Or around that time? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1053.8s)]
*  Before, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1055.8s)]
*  just before, I was there [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1057.8s)]
*  from 2003 [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1059.8s)]
*  through 2008, and then [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1061.8s)]
*  back again, 2010, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1063.8s)]
*  and then back and forth every few years. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1065.8s)]
*  But it's so interesting. I wonder how you have these conversations [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1067.8s)]
*  with people about, you know, October 7th. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1069.8s)]
*  My parents were survivors of Kars-led, though. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1071.8s)]
*  But you have multiple, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1073.8s)]
*  2009, 2012, 2014. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1075.8s)]
*  Gaza is assaulted again and again, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1077.8s)]
*  and yet we treat 2024, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1079.8s)]
*  2025 as if it just came out of nowhere, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1081.8s)]
*  as if there's no precedence. And I wonder, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1083.8s)]
*  as someone who's been there, lived there, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1085.8s)]
*  parents there, how hard [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1087.8s)]
*  is that for you to hear this propaganda [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1089.8s)]
*  incessantly that this just all [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1091.8s)]
*  began on October 7th? Oh, I mean, it's infuriating [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1093.8s)]
*  because you don't even have to talk about Kars-led [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1095.8s)]
*  and all these different wars. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1097.8s)]
*  Go back to a time when Hamas [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1099.8s)]
*  wasn't in power. When I was there very early on [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1101.8s)]
*  in the 2000s, Fatih was in power. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1103.8s)]
*  It was still, we were still in the throes [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1105.8s)]
*  of the second intifada. I was [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1107.8s)]
*  there through the disengagement, which I reported extensively on. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1109.8s)]
*  People forget about that. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1111.8s)]
*  Immediately following the disengagement [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1113.8s)]
*  was actually beginning the onset [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1115.8s)]
*  of what would ultimately be the full [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1117.8s)]
*  scale blockade that we see today. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1119.8s)]
*  This was before Hamas was in power, right? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1121.8s)]
*  Gaza was hermetically sealed for months. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1123.8s)]
*  Ironically, back then, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1125.8s)]
*  humanitarian organizations said, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1127.8s)]
*  this is an unprecedented catastrophe [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1129.8s)]
*  back then. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1131.8s)]
*  This all happened again. We're talking [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1133.8s)]
*  2005, right? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1135.8s)]
*  Then we have 2006, 2007, and so on and so forth. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1137.8s)]
*  But my point is, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1139.8s)]
*  Israel has always [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1141.8s)]
*  exercised, has always [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1143.8s)]
*  subject Gaza to some form of closure [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1145.8s)]
*  or blockade, long before [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1147.8s)]
*  October 7th, right? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1149.8s)]
*  It has always had a noose around Gaza that's just [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1151.8s)]
*  tightened more and more and more. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1153.8s)]
*  And then we see the 18 years, of course, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1155.8s)]
*  of blockade and the havoc [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1157.8s)]
*  that that wreaked on Gaza as well. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1159.8s)]
*  I guess the only thing we can thank Trump [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1161.8s)]
*  and Netanyahu for is the honesty. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1163.8s)]
*  I mean, they openly say, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1165.8s)]
*  we're staying, we want the land, everyone has to get out. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1167.8s)]
*  We don't have to pretend this was about hostages. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1169.8s)]
*  Leila Al-Haddad, thank you so much for your time. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1171.8s)]
*  It was my pleasure. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1173.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkdH2B0lJyM&t=1183.8s)]
