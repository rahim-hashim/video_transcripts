# Mehdi Hasan interviews Jill Stein | EXCLUSIVE
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo)
*  Every vote that's cast for Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump is an endorsement of genocide. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=0.0s)]
*  It is an affirmation of genocide. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=5.2s)]
*  Lay out for me the steps whereby I go into a voting booth, vote green, and the genocide stops. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=7.16s)]
*  I don't see that happening. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=12.6s)]
*  We are creating a very organized coalition that is here for the long haul. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  They were Democrats that were sending cops to campuses to beat up kids on my campus, okay? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=19.36s)]
*  Coming in riot gear to remove people from encampments. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=25.64s)]
*  When people were dying en masse from COVID, when he was praising Nazis, doing domestic terrorism, as Butch says, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=28.8s)]
*  did you ever at any point say, maybe I got that one wrong? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=33.64s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=37.64s)]
*  You said in November 2015, as Assad and Putin were massacring Syrians in their tens of thousands, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=38.2s)]
*  the US should be working with Syria, Russia, and Iran to restore all of Syria to control by the government. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  That's the Assad government. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  That was an unapproved statement which was taken down the moment it was... [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=49.28s)]
*  You seem to have a lot of things online that you don't approve. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=52.52s)]
*  Would you tell your supporters at home, vote green everywhere, but in those three swing states, vote against a domestic terrorist? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=54.839999999999996s)]
*  Um, I would say... [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=61.32s)]
*  Let's go back to 2016 for a moment, when Donald Trump narrowly beat Hillary Clinton in the US presidential election. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=69.32s)]
*  There was one specific politician, a lefty third party candidate who faced a lot of backlash [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=76.0s)]
*  after being accused of playing spoiler and handing the election to Trump. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=80.72s)]
*  I'm talking of course about Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=85.32s)]
*  who famously won tens of thousands of left-leaning votes in several key swing states that year, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=89.2s)]
*  exceeding Trump's margin of victory over Clinton in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=94.24s)]
*  Had all those Stein votes gone to Clinton instead, Trump would never have won the Electoral College nor the presidency. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=99.56s)]
*  Now, Jill Stein has always insisted that she did not cost Clinton that election, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=106.56s)]
*  and that most of her voters wouldn't have even turned out that year if she weren't on the ballot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=110.4s)]
*  Democrats, unsurprisingly, don't agree. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=114.64s)]
*  And they're super mad that she is running for president again, for the Greens, this year, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=117.64s)]
*  in another super close race between Donald Trump and a female Democrat, this time, Kamala Harris. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=122.64s)]
*  Stein and her running mate, the Muslim American historian Butch Ware, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=129.64000000000001s)]
*  are calling for an end to the genocide in Gaza, and perhaps unsurprisingly, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  have the support of a growing number of Muslim voters, which could make a huge difference [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=137.88s)]
*  in crucial swing states like Michigan. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=142.88s)]
*  Here's the thing though, Stein isn't going to win the presidential election. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=145.88s)]
*  She's polling at just 2%. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=149.88s)]
*  So, will her candidacy give us Trump? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=151.88s)]
*  Again, is she right to say Democrats and Republicans are all the same? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=154.88s)]
*  And what about her own contentious record? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=158.88s)]
*  Earlier I sat down for an in-depth interview with Jill Stein and her running mate. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=161.88s)]
*  Now, some of you may think she's a spoiler who doesn't deserve platforming. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=166.12s)]
*  Others may be so enamoured by her that you don't think she should have to answer any tough questions. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=169.12s)]
*  She's great on Gaza. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=173.12s)]
*  Well, I disagree. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=175.12s)]
*  It's important to do a wide-ranging and challenging interview with a presidential candidate. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=177.12s)]
*  So here it is, my sit-down, tough but fair, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=182.12s)]
*  with Green Party presidential and vice presidential candidates Jill Stein and Butch Ware. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=185.12s)]
*  Dr Jill Stein, Professor Butch Ware, Green Party presidential and vice presidential candidates. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=191.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining me on May the Unfiltered. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=196.36s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=198.36s)]
*  Appreciate you being here. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=199.36s)]
*  Jill Stein, what is the Green Party offering the American public in 2024 [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=200.36s)]
*  that the Democratic and Republican parties are not offering? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=205.36s)]
*  Well, for one thing, the American public is clamouring for more choices. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=208.36s)]
*  So, we are a choice. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=214.36s)]
*  And we are a choice that's not bought and paid for by oligarchs and billionaires [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=216.36s)]
*  and the usual suspects and the APAC and the war contractors. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=220.60000000000002s)]
*  And all of these are very hot issues. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  And what we have with Democrats and Republicans, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  with Democrats we have lip service on the key issues that people are in crisis about, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  but not really, not solving the problems, not at all. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=237.60000000000002s)]
*  In fact, taking further steps away from what the public needs. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  We are not getting the healthcare we need. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  Over 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=246.84s)]
*  Half of all Americans are paying up to 50% of their income, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=249.84s)]
*  just to keep a roof over their heads. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=255.84s)]
*  We have incredible crisis going on. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=257.84s)]
*  And despite that, we have a Congress, Democratic and Republican, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=259.84s)]
*  and leadership in the White House that is spending half of our congressional dollars, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=263.84s)]
*  which actually amounts to $12,000 per household according to Jeffrey Sachs, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=267.84s)]
*  if you calculate it out, on this endless war machine, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=272.84s)]
*  which is not serving us and of which the genocide in Gaza [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=276.08s)]
*  is really kind of a microcosm of what's wrong with this imperial foreign policy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=279.08s)]
*  So, Butchware, you are a historian of Africa at the University of California, Santa Barbara. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=284.08s)]
*  You're a prominent Muslim American scholar. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=289.08s)]
*  You're not known as a Green Party stalwart or politician. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=291.08s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=294.08s)]
*  What made you want to join this presidential ticket? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=295.08s)]
*  I'll be honest. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=297.08s)]
*  If you had given me probably 100 years, I wouldn't have volunteered to run for office. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=299.08s)]
*  But when I was called upon to enter into really the fight [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=304.32s)]
*  for all of the things that I've been writing about and researching [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=309.32s)]
*  and organizing in both academic and activist and artistic environments, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=313.32s)]
*  I've always been about connecting people to the resources to strive for social justice. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=318.32s)]
*  So when tagged in by Dr. Jill Stein to run on this ticket, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=324.32s)]
*  I vetted the party platform. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=330.32s)]
*  And one of the things that I discovered, actually, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=333.56s)]
*  is that my oldest friend from childhood, Sean Young, which I had known for a long time, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=335.56s)]
*  Annie Young was actually the first elected Green Party official in the state of Minnesota. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=339.56s)]
*  She served for 20-plus years. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=342.56s)]
*  She was my backup mother. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=344.56s)]
*  I knew all about the Green Party from childhood. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=345.56s)]
*  And what I learned from Annie Young, who is a legend in the state of Minnesota, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=348.56s)]
*  in fact, we went to Annie Young Meadow and had a moment of silence in her honor, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=352.56s)]
*  I found out that Annie Young was one of Dr. Jill Stein's mentors [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=357.56s)]
*  in the Green Party when she came aboard. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=361.8s)]
*  So all of that is just to say that I learned early on in my life [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=364.8s)]
*  that the Green Party doesn't really have politicians, it has public servants. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=368.8s)]
*  And when I was tagged in to public service as opposed to just an academic and activist role, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=372.8s)]
*  yeah, I'm not going back down from a fight. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=377.8s)]
*  Jill, you mentioned Gaza. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=379.8s)]
*  A lot of supporters of Israel say Israel is being unfairly targeted by the left. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=381.8s)]
*  It has a right to defend itself as a Jewish state. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=386.8s)]
*  You are a Jewish critic of Israel. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=389.04s)]
*  What do you say to those who condemn the left for being not anti-Zionist, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=392.04s)]
*  but anti-Semitic, they say, in their criticisms of Israel? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=396.04s)]
*  And just out of interest, also, you're a Jewish critic of Israel. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=399.04s)]
*  Do you consider yourself to be a Zionist? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=402.04s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=404.04s)]
*  I grew up a Zionist. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=406.04s)]
*  It was just part of growing up Jewish after the Holocaust, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=408.04s)]
*  where the genocide of the Jews was a very big deal, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=411.04s)]
*  and where opposing genocide and understanding that genocide must never happen again, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  not to anyone, was really critical to my upbringing and my understanding of the world. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, like all good Jews, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=426.28000000000003s)]
*  I was taught that Israel was a land without people and a people without a land, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  and I had accepted that. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  But as I became active politically, especially with the Green Party, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=439.52s)]
*  where a lot of people were paying attention to this issue, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=444.52s)]
*  in 2006 we took a stand against apartheid, against occupation, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=447.52s)]
*  and on behalf of boycott, divestment and sanctions [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=453.52s)]
*  in order to end the occupation and the ethnic cleansing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=456.52s)]
*  So it's, you know, I have very much become aware [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=460.52s)]
*  that Zionism is not Judaism, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=464.52s)]
*  and the most anti-Semitic thing one can say now [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=467.76s)]
*  is that it is anti-Semitic to oppose genocide, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=471.76s)]
*  in my view, saying that it is, you know, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=475.76s)]
*  anti-Semitic is an absolute slap in the face to Jews, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=479.76s)]
*  and Jews of my generation who grew up in the wake of the genocide, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=483.76s)]
*  you know, that's really inseparable from our Jewish values, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=488.76s)]
*  but from human values, from Muslim values. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=492.76s)]
*  Interesting you mentioned, Jews of your generation, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=495.0s)]
*  there's a big generational gap amongst the American Jewish community [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=497.0s)]
*  where young Jewish Americans are on campus protesting right now [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=500.0s)]
*  and supporting the Greens in many ways. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=503.0s)]
*  Butch, are you hoping, I assume, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=506.0s)]
*  that a lot of not just young voters, progressives, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=509.0s)]
*  but a lot of Muslim and Arab American voters [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=511.0s)]
*  will vote Green this year because of their outrage over Gaza? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=514.0s)]
*  And I wonder, have you got any evidence [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=517.0s)]
*  to support that contention that people aren't just upset, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=519.0s)]
*  they're going to ditch the Dems and vote Green over Gaza? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=522.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't have to hope. We ran the numbers, right? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=524.24s)]
*  So, Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=527.24s)]
*  Dalia Mugahed has actually shown us, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=530.24s)]
*  given us the statistical breakdown, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=533.24s)]
*  these are all publicly available figures. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=535.24s)]
*  So, if you take the three swing states [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=537.24s)]
*  of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=539.24s)]
*  in the 2020 elections, these are all similar demographic states, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=542.24s)]
*  large African-American populations, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=545.24s)]
*  large Muslim populations. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=547.24s)]
*  In 2020, Joe Biden won those states [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=549.24s)]
*  with 65% of the Muslim vote. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=551.24s)]
*  In January 2024, he was receiving 12% of the Muslim vote, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=553.48s)]
*  which means, in point of fact, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=557.48s)]
*  the Democrats have already lost this election. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=559.48s)]
*  Although that was Biden, he's no longer the candidate. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=561.48s)]
*  Aha. And so that number did not even get up to 20% [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=563.48s)]
*  with Kamala Harris. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=565.48s)]
*  Only about 5% are going towards Trump, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=566.48s)]
*  80% are going third party. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=568.48s)]
*  And the overwhelming majority of those that are going third party [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=570.48s)]
*  are coming to the Green Party. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=572.48s)]
*  CARE, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=574.48s)]
*  recently released polling figures [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=576.48s)]
*  that showed nationwide, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=578.48s)]
*  that we are polling neck and neck with Kamala Harris, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=580.72s)]
*  which means that we are already doing massive damage [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=582.72s)]
*  in the Muslim population. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=585.72s)]
*  Although I looked at that CARE poll, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=587.72s)]
*  it's not the most scientific of polls. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=589.72s)]
*  I didn't say it was a scientific poll, however. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=591.72s)]
*  And, according to that CARE poll... [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=593.72s)]
*  The ISPU ones, however, are. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=595.72s)]
*  But the CARE poll, it's interesting, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=597.72s)]
*  since we're on it, just briefly. Sure, absolutely. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=599.72s)]
*  Jill Stein, you're tied at 29-29. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=601.72s)]
*  But that same CARE poll showed you at 36 back in June. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=603.72s)]
*  You've actually dropped seven points [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=605.72s)]
*  since Biden was swapped out for Harris. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=607.72s)]
*  And that's surprising. Yes, and of course she could, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=609.96s)]
*  and she's been getting the benefit of the doubt, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=611.96s)]
*  but I think her recent behaviour is driving people away. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=613.96s)]
*  No argument for me on that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=615.96s)]
*  And she's doing her best to... [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=617.96s)]
*  So let me ask you this, though. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=619.96s)]
*  The Green Party agenda, in my view, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=621.96s)]
*  not speaking of other people, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=623.96s)]
*  is a pretty popular agenda. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=625.96s)]
*  You look at the things you're advocating. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=627.96s)]
*  Americans want it. Absolutely. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=629.96s)]
*  Which is why the Democrats are, you know, waking in their boots. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=631.96s)]
*  But my question is, and we've got a lot to talk about, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=633.96s)]
*  I do want to talk about the agenda, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=635.96s)]
*  but I think it's a bit of a different issue. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=638.2s)]
*  But just at the beginning to establish, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=640.2s)]
*  because you're the candidate, it's a popular agenda, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=642.2s)]
*  but why are you the face of it? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=644.2s)]
*  Why are you the candidate? Because you ran in 2012. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=646.2s)]
*  You ran in 2016. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=648.2s)]
*  I think you got 0.4% of the vote in 2012. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=650.2s)]
*  You got 1.1% in 2016. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=652.2s)]
*  We're living in a year where [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=654.2s)]
*  all the candidates are stepping aside for fresh blood. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=656.2s)]
*  Why did you think, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=658.2s)]
*  I'm going to do this a third time in my 70s, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=660.2s)]
*  having done it in 2012 and 2016? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=662.2s)]
*  Mainly, you know, we had another candidate [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=664.2s)]
*  who was going to be our presidential candidate, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=666.44s)]
*  Dr. Cornel West, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=668.44s)]
*  who has very similar positions to us. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=670.44s)]
*  And very shortly, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=672.44s)]
*  before our paperwork was due, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=674.44s)]
*  he decided he would prefer to run solo. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=676.44s)]
*  For entirely understandable reasons, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=678.44s)]
*  it's not easy to build a relationship [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=680.44s)]
*  with a political party, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=682.44s)]
*  especially a party that doesn't come with a campaign in a box. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=684.44s)]
*  And a small, you know... [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=686.44s)]
*  So you stepped in because there was no one else? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=688.44s)]
*  Well, there was enormous pressure on me [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=690.44s)]
*  to step in, because I was one of two people [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=692.44s)]
*  who could have basically built a campaign [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=694.6800000000001s)]
*  in the three weeks that we had. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=696.6800000000001s)]
*  So, believe me... [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=698.6800000000001s)]
*  I was wondering... [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  If I did not volunteer for this position, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=702.6800000000001s)]
*  I was not going to run for office. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  Hold on, let me pose a question. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=706.6800000000001s)]
*  I've got a question for both of you that's relevant to this. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  Which is, there is also an experience issue [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  to address here, obvious experience issue. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=712.6800000000001s)]
*  When Trump ran for president, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=714.6800000000001s)]
*  a lot of people, myself included, said he did not have the experience. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=716.6800000000001s)]
*  A reality TV star, a dodgy New York property developer [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=718.6800000000001s)]
*  had no business being anywhere near the Oval Office. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=720.6800000000001s)]
*  And he proved it in office. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=722.92s)]
*  He was completely incompetent, reckless, put aside the ideology. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=724.92s)]
*  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=726.92s)]
*  Yet he wasn't just not qualified, he had no history of public service. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=728.92s)]
*  You, Jill Stein, have only served in one elected role, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=730.92s)]
*  I believe, on Lexington Town Council, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=732.92s)]
*  which you won with 539 votes. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=734.92s)]
*  Butch Ware, I think you mentioned already, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=736.92s)]
*  you've not run for office before, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=738.92s)]
*  you've not held any office before. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=740.92s)]
*  So, what makes the two of you qualified [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=742.92s)]
*  to run the world's most powerful country, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=744.92s)]
*  the world's biggest economy, most advanced military? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=746.92s)]
*  Yeah, so... You go first. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=748.92s)]
*  Let me just jump in. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=751.16s)]
*  So, I served for five years on Lexington Town meeting. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=753.16s)]
*  But beyond that, I served in leadership positions [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=755.16s)]
*  enacting campaign finance reform and public financing [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=758.16s)]
*  in the state of Massachusetts, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=762.16s)]
*  where we passed that as a referendum, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=764.16s)]
*  had to build a strong coalition, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=766.16s)]
*  had to, you know, do all the public policy things [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=768.16s)]
*  in order to do that. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=770.16s)]
*  I helped lead the effort to clean up our coal plants [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=772.16s)]
*  and to push for renewable energy in Massachusetts. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=776.16s)]
*  Which are great efforts, but not qualifications [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=779.4s)]
*  to be commander-in-chief of the world's most powerful country. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=781.4s)]
*  Well, I don't know about that. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=784.4s)]
*  I mean, because what's really important to have [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=786.4s)]
*  is not to have experience being bought off. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=789.4s)]
*  And that alone, I think, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=791.4s)]
*  puts our campaign head and shoulders [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=793.4s)]
*  above our competitors here. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=795.4s)]
*  We are not bought off. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=797.4s)]
*  Might I be tagged in? Please. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=799.4s)]
*  I'm looking forward to the day [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=801.4s)]
*  that they allow Dr Jill Stein on stage [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=803.4s)]
*  with the other two candidates. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=805.4s)]
*  I'm not going to question with respect to qualifications. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=807.64s)]
*  And Dr Jill Stein can look towards Team Red [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=809.64s)]
*  and say this one is being led by a domestic terrorist [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=811.64s)]
*  who attempted to overthrow the United States government [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=814.64s)]
*  on January 6. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=816.64s)]
*  So, who has the qualifications? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=818.64s)]
*  The other one, Team Blue, is being led by a woman [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=820.64s)]
*  who has participated actively [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=822.64s)]
*  in what the International Criminal Court [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=824.64s)]
*  and International Court of Justice have defined as what? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=826.64s)]
*  An illegal apartheid state [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=828.64s)]
*  committing an illegal genocide? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=830.64s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=832.64s)]
*  No, no, one second. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=834.64s)]
*  I'm not talking about qualifications. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=836.88s)]
*  It's not about policy. It's actually about qualifications. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=838.88s)]
*  It's about building. It's about building coalitions [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=840.88s)]
*  that can work together and accomplish things. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=842.88s)]
*  An apartheid state, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=844.88s)]
*  an illegal genocide and an illegal occupation. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=846.88s)]
*  So, all of these things are to say [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=848.88s)]
*  is that there are moral and ethical qualifications [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=850.88s)]
*  for holding office as well. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=852.88s)]
*  And as for me, as a 30-year-old assistant professor, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=854.88s)]
*  I was managing $1.5 million in grants [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=856.88s)]
*  operating international programs. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=858.88s)]
*  There's no question [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=860.88s)]
*  that with an actual medical doctor [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=862.88s)]
*  and a PhD that we have been at the top [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=865.12s)]
*  of our respective fields, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=867.12s)]
*  that we are going to be the most qualified [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=869.12s)]
*  White House, actually, to serve in any recent memory. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=871.12s)]
*  You don't think you need to be a senator, a governor, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=873.12s)]
*  served in the military? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=875.12s)]
*  A government of 3 million people deal with world leaders? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=877.12s)]
*  You make it sound very simple. On that basis, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=879.12s)]
*  couldn't anyone walking down the street in D.C. run for president? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=881.12s)]
*  On the description that Butch just gave? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=883.12s)]
*  They could not. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=885.12s)]
*  I mean, it's not a simple matter to run for president. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=887.12s)]
*  I'm glad we agree on it. Now we're in agreement. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=889.12s)]
*  We will. And we are the only [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=891.12s)]
*  people-powered political party [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=893.36s)]
*  that actually has nationwide ballot access. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=895.36s)]
*  And we have maintained that, actually, for decades. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=897.36s)]
*  So, you know, on so many [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=899.36s)]
*  fronts, we are [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=901.36s)]
*  qualified and we are uniquely qualified. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=903.36s)]
*  And further, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=905.36s)]
*  we have supporters [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=907.36s)]
*  who have had that experience. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=909.36s)]
*  So, Jeffrey Sachs, for example, would be our [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=911.36s)]
*  Secretary of State, is a very strong supporter [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=913.36s)]
*  for the campaign. Michael Hudson [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=915.36s)]
*  has advised many [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=917.36s)]
*  governments around the world. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=919.36s)]
*  I do remember Trump saying, I'll surround myself with great [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=921.6s)]
*  people, too. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=923.6s)]
*  Leadership is the capacity to delegate responsibility. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=925.6s)]
*  Right? And to listen and to take [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=927.6s)]
*  counsel. And Jill is a leader. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=929.6s)]
*  Let's talk about policy. Since you mentioned policy there, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=931.6s)]
*  you mentioned the International Criminal Court. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=933.6s)]
*  You say you're running to stop the genocide. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=935.6s)]
*  Right? Oh, yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=937.6s)]
*  Can you explain to me and to our viewers [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=939.6s)]
*  how voting for you both in November, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=941.6s)]
*  given you won't actually win the presidency, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=943.6s)]
*  will stop, given you won't actually [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=945.6s)]
*  win the presidency, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=947.6s)]
*  will stop the genocide? How does a protest vote [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=949.84s)]
*  for the greens, and I get the protest vote, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=951.84s)]
*  I get a lot of people, and I understand it, but how [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=953.84s)]
*  does it stop the genocide? Lay down the steps for me [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=955.84s)]
*  that stops the genocide. Yeah, so [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=957.84s)]
*  what stops the genocide, number one, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=959.84s)]
*  you know, if we turn the White [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=961.84s)]
*  House green, which would be a great thing, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=963.84s)]
*  but we would pick up the phone. I would [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=965.84s)]
*  pick up the phone on day one and the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=967.84s)]
*  genocide is over. So this is actually [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=969.84s)]
*  doable. But you're not going to be president. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=971.84s)]
*  Says you. No, says the polls. You're [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=973.84s)]
*  at 2% in the polls. And because we cannot [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=975.84s)]
*  get on mainstream media, Mahdi, so you [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=978.08s)]
*  are part... I'm not saying why. Exactly. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=980.08s)]
*  I'm not saying why you're at 2%, there's many [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=982.08s)]
*  reasons why you're at 2%. I'm just saying you're not going to be president [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=984.08s)]
*  on November the 5th. In your view. No, no, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=986.08s)]
*  in your view too. No. You, but you... [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=988.08s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. Can I suggest we table that discussion? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=990.08s)]
*  Go ahead, Dr. Zuck. Because we're not going to come to the end of that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=992.08s)]
*  Well, let's part that and say how do we stop the genocide [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=994.08s)]
*  then, if you're not going to. Yes, let's focus on that. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=996.08s)]
*  Because every vote that's cast [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=998.08s)]
*  for Kamala Harris or for Donald Trump [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1000.08s)]
*  is an endorsement of genocide. It is [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1002.08s)]
*  an affirmation of genocide. It says [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1004.08s)]
*  that you, the voter, says [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1006.08s)]
*  that this is OK. You are holding your nose [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1008.08s)]
*  and voting for genocide. Understood. I understand that argument. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1010.08s)]
*  On the other hand, every vote for our campaign [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1012.08s)]
*  is a shot across the bow of the empire. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1014.08s)]
*  So it's about feeling good. It's not about actually changing things. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1016.08s)]
*  It's about consolidating power. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1018.08s)]
*  What you just described is a feeling, right? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1020.08s)]
*  No, no. I said it is a shot... I asked for a plan. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1022.08s)]
*  Let me finish my question, then you can answer. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1024.08s)]
*  Let me repeat the question. Lay out [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1026.08s)]
*  for me the steps whereby I go [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1028.08s)]
*  into a voting booth, vote green, and [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1030.08s)]
*  the genocide stops. Let me put it very clearly. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1032.08s)]
*  So whether we get [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1034.08s)]
*  2%, 5%, 15%, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1036.08s)]
*  we are creating [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1038.08s)]
*  a very organized coalition [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1040.08s)]
*  that is here for the long haul [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1042.08s)]
*  for a political vehicle to stop [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1044.08s)]
*  genocide and the imperial [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1046.08s)]
*  policies that go with it. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1048.08s)]
*  So every vote that one casts is [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1050.08s)]
*  huge. And every time one even registers [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1052.08s)]
*  in the polls on behalf of our campaign [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1054.08s)]
*  is another warning shot. I understand that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1056.08s)]
*  So where does that go? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1058.08s)]
*  Where that goes is directly to the White House [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1060.08s)]
*  and to Congress to say that [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1062.08s)]
*  we not only have public opinions [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1064.08s)]
*  polls to show that this is [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1066.08s)]
*  the very firm commitment [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1068.08s)]
*  of the American people right now. So it's a pressure campaign. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1070.08s)]
*  It's to send a message. Send a message [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1072.08s)]
*  to who, though? To the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1074.08s)]
*  power holders. Who will be the power holder? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1076.08s)]
*  So whoever they are. And right now [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1078.08s)]
*  they are, both Democrats and Republicans, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1080.08s)]
*  are ignoring the American people [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1082.08s)]
*  68%. So I just want to be clear. If you get 15%, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1084.08s)]
*  20%, let's say you get Ross Perot numbers, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1086.08s)]
*  it would be huge. It's absolutely huge. And there's no sign you're going to do that. But let's say you did. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1088.08s)]
*  You think that would then on November the 5th... [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1090.08s)]
*  And let me just say, Mette, don't close it down before it happens. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1092.08s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1094.08s)]
*  Who would have thought Joe Biden was going to be replaced by Kamala Harris? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1096.08s)]
*  If this was six months ago, I would give you [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1098.08s)]
*  time. In less than 60 days... [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1100.08s)]
*  Let me just finish my point, and I'll come to you. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1102.08s)]
*  The point you're making, I get it. You get to 15%, 20%, that would be huge. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1104.08s)]
*  You'd be Ross Perot territory if you got there. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1106.08s)]
*  And we are not going away. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1108.08s)]
*  But November the 6th, you're saying whoever the president elect [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1110.08s)]
*  is, Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, would look at that number [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1112.08s)]
*  and say, I need to change course. Even though they've just won. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1114.08s)]
*  You don't have to get to election day for that. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1116.08s)]
*  I'm glad you made that point. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1118.08s)]
*  So let me bring you in, Butch. Noura Erekat. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1120.08s)]
*  You know Noura Erekat. Palestinian-American activist [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1122.08s)]
*  academic. I believe she was considered [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1124.08s)]
*  to be your running mate before you offered the slot to Butch. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1126.08s)]
*  She says she turned you down [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1128.08s)]
*  because she wants to pressure the Democrats, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1130.08s)]
*  specifically the Democrats, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1132.08s)]
*  the current people in power, into [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1134.08s)]
*  changing course on Gaza. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1136.08s)]
*  But you refuse to agree to step aside [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1138.08s)]
*  if Harris did the right thing on a ceasefire [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1140.08s)]
*  or an arms embargo. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1142.08s)]
*  Doesn't that suggest that your party's [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1144.08s)]
*  priority is not stopping the genocide. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1146.08s)]
*  It is being in the race as a spoiler [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1148.08s)]
*  no matter what happens in Gaza. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1150.08s)]
*  No, absolutely not. And the reason for that... [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1152.08s)]
*  That's what Noura's tweet suggests. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1154.08s)]
*  Yes. Well, Noura is new to the political process. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1156.08s)]
*  Bless her heart for even considering, you know, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1158.08s)]
*  doing this absolutely insane [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1160.08s)]
*  way of life. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1162.08s)]
*  But she is new to this process. And one thing you learn [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1164.08s)]
*  is that if you lose your ballot status, you're not getting it back. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1166.08s)]
*  Especially nowadays when it's way [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1168.08s)]
*  more costly. It's absolutely prohibitive. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1170.08s)]
*  So if as a grassroots [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1172.08s)]
*  people-powered campaign you give up your ballot status, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1174.08s)]
*  you're done. So what we know [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1176.08s)]
*  is that simply getting a ceasefire [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1178.08s)]
*  is not over and done. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1180.08s)]
*  We still have an occupation. We still have an apartheid state. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1182.08s)]
*  You're not going to end the occupation between now and November the 5th. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1184.08s)]
*  Yes, but that's exactly the point. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1186.08s)]
*  Is that we have to be here for the long haul. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1188.08s)]
*  We are not just till November 6th. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1190.08s)]
*  Talk me through. You're saying [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1192.08s)]
*  Noura doesn't understand politics. Noura's logic seems to be [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1194.08s)]
*  pretty simple. If you go to the Democrats and say, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1196.08s)]
*  hey, we've got all this support, if you don't give [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1198.08s)]
*  an arms embargo, and the Democrats say, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1200.08s)]
*  hey, we can't do this, we can't do this, we can't do that, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1202.08s)]
*  and then they will say, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1204.08s)]
*  why? We give you an arms embargo, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1206.08s)]
*  and then you carry on running. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1208.08s)]
*  And then they change their mind. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1210.08s)]
*  But they can say the same to you. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1212.08s)]
*  What we can say to them right now is that if you agree to that arms [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1214.08s)]
*  embargo, you are winning back a lot of votes. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1216.08s)]
*  Whose votes? Your votes? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1218.08s)]
*  The votes that are coming to us. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1220.08s)]
*  The votes of the American people. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1222.08s)]
*  You'll say that publicly? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1224.08s)]
*  We already have. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1226.08s)]
*  I want to be clear, because it's not clear to me. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1228.08s)]
*  I'm not saying she will. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1230.08s)]
*  She's not the president. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1232.08s)]
*  But she is the vice president. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1234.08s)]
*  We know she doesn't control Joe Biden. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1236.08s)]
*  But she has a lot of say in this. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1238.08s)]
*  Now the goalposts seem to be moving. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1240.08s)]
*  If the presidential candidate says, as uncommitted [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1242.08s)]
*  movement want her to say, I support an arms embargo on [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1244.08s)]
*  Israel, you will say, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1246.08s)]
*  I'm just trying to get to the end of this process, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1248.08s)]
*  you will say, I, Jill Stein, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1250.08s)]
*  say you will get some of my supporters on November [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1252.08s)]
*  5th. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1254.08s)]
*  Well, clearly she will. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1256.08s)]
*  I have already acknowledged that [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1258.08s)]
*  a lot of support is coming [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1260.08s)]
*  to us because of Kamala [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1262.08s)]
*  Harris' refusal to [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1264.08s)]
*  consider an arms embargo. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1266.08s)]
*  It's actually relatively simple and straightforward. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1268.08s)]
*  Imagine being in a position [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1270.08s)]
*  where all you have to do [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1272.08s)]
*  in order to win election [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1274.08s)]
*  is to stop committing the most [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1276.08s)]
*  heinous, hold on, let me finish, Maddie. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1278.08s)]
*  Stop committing the most heinous genocide [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1280.08s)]
*  in recent memory. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1282.08s)]
*  A decimation, literally one tenth [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1284.08s)]
*  of the population murdered in 11 months. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1286.08s)]
*  And all you have to do [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1288.08s)]
*  in order to meet the American people is [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1290.08s)]
*  to stop that genocide. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1292.08s)]
*  This question, in point of fact, is not [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1294.08s)]
*  for us. This question is for Kamala [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1296.08s)]
*  Harris. How deeply [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1298.08s)]
*  does your soul have to be folded in [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1300.08s)]
*  the pockets of APAC and the war machine [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1302.08s)]
*  that you are willing to lose this [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1304.08s)]
*  election because they have already lost this [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1306.08s)]
*  election if they continue with this [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1308.08s)]
*  stance. With the respect, I do a lot of these interviews. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1310.08s)]
*  Absolutely. And I tell people, I'm going to tell you [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1312.08s)]
*  what I tell everyone else. Say it. I've had Democrats on my show [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1314.08s)]
*  sitting right where you sat. I've asked them these questions. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1316.08s)]
*  This is not about the Democrats. I'm asking the Green Party [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1318.08s)]
*  strategy. Fair point. So I'm saying if the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1320.08s)]
*  Green Party say we're going to stop the genocide when [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1322.08s)]
*  you vote for us, we're entitled to say [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1324.08s)]
*  how does voting for you stop the genocide? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1326.08s)]
*  And might I just expand on this particular [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1328.08s)]
*  point? The Green Party does [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1330.08s)]
*  not exist simply to stop [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1332.08s)]
*  the genocide in Gaza. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1334.08s)]
*  The Green Party exists in order [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1336.08s)]
*  to restore democracy to the American [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1338.08s)]
*  people in order to provide [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1340.08s)]
*  a voice for all of the people [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1342.08s)]
*  who are not interested in the [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1344.08s)]
*  culture wars between red and blue. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1346.08s)]
*  It is there to do [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1348.08s)]
*  long-term things like establish rank [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1350.08s)]
*  choice voting, to abolish the electoral [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1352.08s)]
*  college, to run on reparations, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1354.08s)]
*  land back, social housing. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1356.08s)]
*  But that's my point. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1358.08s)]
*  You do not just throw [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1360.08s)]
*  away 40 years of building [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1362.08s)]
*  a party because Nora Arakat wants [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1364.08s)]
*  you to. I just wanted to be clear [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1366.08s)]
*  as to what the goal was. You make it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1368.08s)]
*  very clear that you are about more than the genocide. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1370.08s)]
*  I just wanted to make that clear. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1372.08s)]
*  And to her benefit, what she [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1374.08s)]
*  suggested is not [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1376.08s)]
*  some kind of crazy [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1378.08s)]
*  outlandish idea. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1380.08s)]
*  You can understand as a Democrat [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1382.08s)]
*  if you're pushing your party, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1384.08s)]
*  there are a lot of good Democrats trying to push their party [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1386.08s)]
*  towards something reasonable. And then the Green [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1388.08s)]
*  say we're running anyways and we're still going to screw you over. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1390.08s)]
*  Democrats might think, well, you don't really need to. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1392.08s)]
*  We're not screwing people over. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1394.08s)]
*  I'm so glad you said that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1396.08s)]
*  because that's brought me to my next question. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1398.08s)]
*  So we can move on to that subject. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1400.08s)]
*  Democrats think you are screwing the moment. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1402.08s)]
*  Well, of course they are. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1404.08s)]
*  Because they are screwing themselves. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1406.08s)]
*  Hold on, let me ask a question and then you can answer. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1408.08s)]
*  In 2016, you know [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1410.08s)]
*  the number of votes you got in the three crucial [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1412.08s)]
*  swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1414.08s)]
*  exceeded Donald Trump's margin of victory [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1416.08s)]
*  over Hillary Clinton, each of those three [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1418.08s)]
*  states. You and I spoke before that election [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1420.08s)]
*  where I said, hey, you might actually swing some [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1422.08s)]
*  of these states. Do you want to tell people to vote Hillary in swing states? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1424.08s)]
*  You said absolutely not. We talked about it on Al Jazeera [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1426.08s)]
*  at the time. I know you point out [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1428.08s)]
*  that a lot of those voters would have stayed at home. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1430.08s)]
*  So they wouldn't have swung it. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1432.08s)]
*  But they would have stayed at home [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1434.08s)]
*  unless you had told them to vote for Hillary Clinton, which you refused to do. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1436.08s)]
*  They would not. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1438.08s)]
*  They don't respect you. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1440.08s)]
*  Our voters do not take marching orders from political parties. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1442.08s)]
*  Okay, so fine. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1444.08s)]
*  We'll have to agree to disagree [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1446.08s)]
*  what would have happened in 2016. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1448.08s)]
*  But in 2024, I wonder, or in 2017-18, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1450.08s)]
*  when you saw, you told me at the time [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1452.08s)]
*  there's no difference, there's not enough difference between Clinton [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1454.08s)]
*  and Trump is what you told me at the time. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1456.08s)]
*  Well, what I said is that they're not different enough to save your job, to save your life. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1458.08s)]
*  And you said they're both evils. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1460.08s)]
*  You said they're both evils, just as you said about [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1462.08s)]
*  Harris and Trump. I'm just wondering, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1464.08s)]
*  was during the Trump, during that disastrous [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1466.08s)]
*  Trump presidency, when kids were being [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1468.08s)]
*  kidnapped from their parents at the border, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1470.08s)]
*  when people were dying en masse from COVID, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1472.08s)]
*  when he was praising Nazis, doing domestic terrorism, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1474.08s)]
*  as Butch says, did you ever at any point [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1476.08s)]
*  say, maybe I got that one wrong? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1478.08s)]
*  Oh, no. No. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1480.08s)]
*  It's just that we needed [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1482.08s)]
*  to have given the American people [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1484.08s)]
*  a greater choice here, and we need [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1486.08s)]
*  to have been heard. We're not going to... [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1488.08s)]
*  Remember, you know, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1490.08s)]
*  Trump voters are basically [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1492.08s)]
*  people who are voting [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1494.08s)]
*  against Democrats, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1496.08s)]
*  against Hillary Clinton, against Joe Biden. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1498.08s)]
*  You know, that's where that came from. It also came from [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1500.08s)]
*  the Pied Piper strategy, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1502.08s)]
*  whereby the Democrats lifted up the most extreme [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1504.08s)]
*  Republican, and they do that over and over. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1506.08s)]
*  I'm not defending the Democrats. I'm asking you. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1508.08s)]
*  Do you ever go, you know what, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1510.08s)]
*  judging how bad Trump was, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1512.08s)]
*  when people were piling up in morgues in New York, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1514.08s)]
*  when he was telling people to put [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1516.08s)]
*  bleach in your arms? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1518.08s)]
*  Actually, Hillary would have done COVID better. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1520.08s)]
*  We all know she would have. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1522.08s)]
*  Hillary could have started World War III. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1524.08s)]
*  Do you ever think, maybe I got that one wrong? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1526.08s)]
*  No. No, not at all. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1528.08s)]
*  Because I am absolutely convinced [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1530.08s)]
*  that Democrats are not the solution [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1532.08s)]
*  to right-wing extremism. In many ways, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1534.08s)]
*  they are the cause of it, through austerity, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1536.08s)]
*  through privatization, through big tax [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1538.08s)]
*  and the like. But in the moment, 2017 to [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1540.08s)]
*  2020, as the people are dying, as the Nazis [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1542.08s)]
*  are marching, you're not thinking, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1544.08s)]
*  it was wrong of me to say they're the same. None of these things [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1546.08s)]
*  exist in isolation. We have several converging crises right now. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1548.08s)]
*  So here's the problem. Back in June, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1550.08s)]
*  this is what, we're doing this all again, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1552.08s)]
*  the same arguments are being made, as you know, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1554.08s)]
*  it's not just Democrats saying, you're helping Donald Trump. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1556.08s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying, he said at a rally, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1558.08s)]
*  Jill Stein, I like her very much. You know why? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1560.08s)]
*  She takes 100% from them. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1562.08s)]
*  Donald Trump seems to like your candidacy. Steve Bannon [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1564.08s)]
*  is saying, why are Republicans saying this? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1566.08s)]
*  You know, I think they have the same, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1568.08s)]
*  what should we say, extremely enlightened [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1570.08s)]
*  and visionary understanding of politics. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1572.08s)]
*  No, I don't look to them for [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1574.08s)]
*  political analysis. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1576.08s)]
*  No, I don't think that... They're working on your behalf. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1578.08s)]
*  According to the AP, let me put this to you. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1580.08s)]
*  According to the Associated Press, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1582.08s)]
*  just last week, Jefferson Thomas, a long-time [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1584.08s)]
*  Republican party operator from Colorado, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1586.08s)]
*  submitted petition signatures that his GOP [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1588.08s)]
*  law firm gathered on behalf of your [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1590.08s)]
*  campaign in New Hampshire. Republicans [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1592.08s)]
*  are cynically working to get you on the ballot [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1594.08s)]
*  because they think you're going to help them. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1596.08s)]
*  Of course, and this enemy of my enemy is my friend [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1598.08s)]
*  logic is exactly the thing that the Democrats [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1600.08s)]
*  utilize... And of course, Democrats, these are [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1602.08s)]
*  Republicans. But are you listening [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1604.08s)]
*  to my point? So what I'm saying is that [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1606.08s)]
*  the Republicans are thinking exactly the same way. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1608.08s)]
*  We're not operating [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1610.08s)]
*  according to the same logic. We believe [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1612.08s)]
*  that we will draw many of those [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1614.08s)]
*  Bernie Trump voters. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1616.08s)]
*  We believe that with an actual [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1618.08s)]
*  working class agenda that meets the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1620.08s)]
*  needs of the American people, we will bring [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1622.08s)]
*  new voters into the process. We believe [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1624.08s)]
*  that by using data analysis [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1626.08s)]
*  carefully and reaching out to this [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1628.08s)]
*  young generation that is on fire about [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1630.08s)]
*  Gaza, that we will enroll [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1632.08s)]
*  a lot of new voters in the 18-29 [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1634.08s)]
*  demographic. What those [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1636.08s)]
*  right-wing thugs do is [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1638.08s)]
*  their business. It has no [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1640.08s)]
*  purchase over our game plan. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1642.08s)]
*  Stop putting in petitions on our ballot. Absolutely. We don't need y'all's help. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1644.08s)]
*  By the way, you mentioned Bernie. Bernie, of course, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1646.08s)]
*  is also worried that you are going to cost [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1648.08s)]
*  the Democrats or help Trump win. If Bernie had run [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1650.08s)]
*  as a Green, he'd probably be President. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1652.08s)]
*  So let me ask you this. It's not just Democrats [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1654.08s)]
*  saying that you're helping the Republicans. It's not [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1656.08s)]
*  just Republicans saying you're helping the Republicans. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1658.08s)]
*  You yourself seem to endorse that message, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1660.08s)]
*  Jill Stein, over the weekend. You liked a comment [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1662.08s)]
*  on Instagram which said, and I quote, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1664.08s)]
*  the Dems need to be stopped. Either vote [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1666.08s)]
*  for Trump or if you can't, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1668.08s)]
*  then vote Green. You're endorsing the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1670.08s)]
*  acceptability of voting for a fascist. I don't know who [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1672.08s)]
*  liked that comment. It's your personal [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1674.08s)]
*  page, Dr. Jill Stein's Instagram page. Yeah, well, it [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1676.08s)]
*  certainly wasn't done by me. So I don't know if some staff... [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1678.08s)]
*  You might want to monitor that because you're a presidential [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1680.08s)]
*  candidate and you're endorsing it, guys. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1682.08s)]
*  He didn't say vote Green. He said, vote for Trump. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1684.08s)]
*  And if you can't, then vote Green. And you liked [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1686.08s)]
*  that comment. Well, that's crazy. Yeah. No, I would never [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1688.08s)]
*  agree with that. Okay, well, I hope [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1690.08s)]
*  we can fix that. That's from your Instagram [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1692.08s)]
*  over the weekend. And let me say the dirty tricks being played [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1694.08s)]
*  here by the Republicans are [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1696.08s)]
*  small change compared to the dirty tricks here being [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1698.08s)]
*  played by Democrats. And I'm not here to defend anyone's dirty tricks. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1700.08s)]
*  I'm just asking questions. And actually, you talk [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1702.08s)]
*  about Democrats. At a press conference [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1704.08s)]
*  in Chicago you did last month, there were a bunch of people [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1706.08s)]
*  standing around you holding abandoned Harris signs. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1708.08s)]
*  You're a third party. You're [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1710.08s)]
*  against both main parties, right? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1712.08s)]
*  One of the criticisms from the Democrats is you're only ever [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1714.08s)]
*  anti-them, not the Republicans. Where were the signs [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1716.08s)]
*  saying abandon Trump? I didn't see any in that one. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1718.08s)]
*  Well, that wasn't under discussion [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1720.08s)]
*  at the moment. But absolutely, we [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1722.08s)]
*  are very much on record against Trump. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1724.08s)]
*  But it's the Democrats who are forever [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1726.08s)]
*  being held up as a yardstick [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1728.08s)]
*  to measure us against. So that's where [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1730.08s)]
*  a lot of clarity needs to be lent. But you would [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1732.08s)]
*  understand the perception, if you're just surrounded by people [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1734.08s)]
*  saying abandon Harris, it looks like you're just running an anti-democratic campaign, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1736.08s)]
*  not anti-Republic. Well, you know, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1738.08s)]
*  people can make of it what they will, but we are very [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1740.08s)]
*  clear, you know, our [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1742.08s)]
*  overarching comment on [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1744.08s)]
*  this is that the Democrats [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1746.08s)]
*  give lip service to the right things [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1748.08s)]
*  whereas the Republicans [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1750.08s)]
*  don't even try. They don't even pretend to be working. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1752.08s)]
*  If I might bring Malcolm into the [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1754.08s)]
*  conversation, and this was where we started a [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1756.08s)]
*  conversation on an Instagram [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1758.08s)]
*  Live that ended up with this candidacy coming together, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1760.08s)]
*  right? This shared inheritance from [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1762.08s)]
*  Malcolm X. Malcolm called the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1764.08s)]
*  liberals foxes and the conservative [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1766.08s)]
*  wolves. The liberals bear their teeth [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1768.08s)]
*  and you think that they're smiling at you, but [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1770.08s)]
*  they're there to eat you. You're on the menu. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1772.08s)]
*  The wolf bears its teeth and you [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1774.08s)]
*  know its intent. That is the, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1776.08s)]
*  if I can say, the official position of this campaign [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1778.08s)]
*  with respect to Teams [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1780.08s)]
*  Red and Team Blue. So one is an open [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1782.08s)]
*  enemy, one is a concealed enemy. So I [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1784.08s)]
*  got it. Let's drill down. I'm glad you brought that up. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1786.08s)]
*  Do you believe, first of all, before [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1788.08s)]
*  I get to that question, if Trump wins [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1790.08s)]
*  in November, are you fine with that? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1792.08s)]
*  Am I fine with that? [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1794.08s)]
*  No thinking person would be fine with [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1796.08s)]
*  the idea of a completely [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1798.08s)]
*  incompetent, amoral, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1800.08s)]
*  foolish, right? This is a man who [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1802.08s)]
*  could not pass any of my university classes [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1804.08s)]
*  under any circumstances, right? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1806.08s)]
*  So are you as fine [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1808.08s)]
*  with that as you are as fine with Harris winning? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1810.08s)]
*  Six of one, half a dozen [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1812.08s)]
*  of the other. Equally bad? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1814.08s)]
*  Absolutely. And I'm going to tell you why. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1816.08s)]
*  And this is what I wanted to say in response [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1818.08s)]
*  to the question that you were posing earlier. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1820.08s)]
*  Everybody is fear mongering around a [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1822.08s)]
*  Trump presidency. I'm sorry, they were [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1824.08s)]
*  Democrats that were sending [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1826.08s)]
*  cops to campuses to beat up [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1828.08s)]
*  kids on my campus, okay? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1830.08s)]
*  Coming in riot gear to remove people from [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1832.08s)]
*  encampments. These were Democratic [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1834.08s)]
*  cities, Democratic, hold on, Democratic [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1836.08s)]
*  establishments that are keeping the [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1838.08s)]
*  cops back and allowing modern [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1840.08s)]
*  day ear goons, thugs, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1842.08s)]
*  to beat up kids on UCLA campus. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1844.08s)]
*  These are Democrats that are building cop cities. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1846.08s)]
*  But you don't think it can get worse? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1848.08s)]
*  I want to finish with which because you made the point. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1850.08s)]
*  You don't think it can get worse? You don't think [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1852.08s)]
*  Project Twenty-Twenty, you don't think putting the military on the streets, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1854.08s)]
*  the insurrection act, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1856.08s)]
*  you called the domestic [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1858.08s)]
*  terrorist earlier? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1860.08s)]
*  Is Carmen Harris a domestic terrorist? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1862.08s)]
*  She's an international war criminal. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1864.08s)]
*  It's an interesting [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1866.08s)]
*  semantic question. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1868.08s)]
*  Let me put it this way. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1870.08s)]
*  May I answer the question? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1872.08s)]
*  So what I said in a social media post [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1874.08s)]
*  some time back was that [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1876.08s)]
*  whether you vote Team Red or Team Blue, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1878.08s)]
*  militarized fascism wins. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1880.08s)]
*  And the reason is that both [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1882.08s)]
*  are operated by the 1%. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1884.08s)]
*  They share 95% of the same patronage [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1886.08s)]
*  networks. They are owned by [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1888.08s)]
*  APAC and the war machine. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1890.08s)]
*  There is a faction fight [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1892.08s)]
*  amongst the 1% with [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1894.08s)]
*  Christian right-wing evangelicals and a diversity [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1896.08s)]
*  agenda on the other side and that is driving [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1898.08s)]
*  this combat. But the faction fight is pretty [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1900.08s)]
*  existential. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1902.08s)]
*  The faction fight is existential [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1904.08s)]
*  for people like you who cannot [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1906.08s)]
*  imagine a green future and can only [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1908.08s)]
*  imagine endless war between [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1910.08s)]
*  teams Red and Blue. As for us, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1912.08s)]
*  we're not interested in the purple fascists. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1914.08s)]
*  For us, they're very, very similar. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1916.08s)]
*  I guess the problem is this is great rhetoric, but in practice [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1918.08s)]
*  it is rhetoric. Let me just give [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1920.08s)]
*  you specifics and you come back in. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1922.08s)]
*  When you say they're both great evils, they're both equally bad, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1924.08s)]
*  this is what bothers me. On Gaza, maybe you're right. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1926.08s)]
*  But on a whole host of other important issues, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1928.08s)]
*  the fact is that Trump is undeniably [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1930.08s)]
*  demonstrably much worse than Harris. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1932.08s)]
*  Let me give you some examples. If Trump is elected, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1934.08s)]
*  over 10 million undocumented immigrants are going to be [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1936.08s)]
*  targeted in a bloody, you say fear monger, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1938.08s)]
*  his words this weekend, in a bloody military [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1940.08s)]
*  operation. If Trump is elected, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1942.08s)]
*  one study says there will be four billion [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1944.08s)]
*  tons of additional U.S. emissions [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1946.08s)]
*  by 2030, which you might think would be [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1948.08s)]
*  a big deal for the Green Party. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1950.08s)]
*  If he's elected, all the gains that workers have made [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1952.08s)]
*  during the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1954.08s)]
*  undeniable organizing gains, trade union [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1956.08s)]
*  and trade union will be gone. If Trump is elected, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1958.08s)]
*  we have another pandemic, people will die [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1960.08s)]
*  in their hundreds of thousands. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1962.08s)]
*  They're not dying now? The COVID is making a [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1964.08s)]
*  major comeback as we speak. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1966.08s)]
*  Half a million people died in the last year of Trump presidency. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1968.08s)]
*  Please don't insult those people by saying that happens [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1970.08s)]
*  every presidency. How is that an insult? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1972.08s)]
*  There are lots of people dying from COVID. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1974.08s)]
*  That was sui generis to Trump. You know that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1976.08s)]
*  You know that no one else would have handled COVID like Trump. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1978.08s)]
*  We agree that the man is incompetent. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1980.08s)]
*  No question. So I'm asking you about the policies. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1982.08s)]
*  Let me talk specifically. Please. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1984.08s)]
*  I'm asking you about the horrible things that Trump does [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1986.08s)]
*  and then we see the Democrats who drop those policies. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1988.08s)]
*  What I read out to you, you're not bothered by [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1990.08s)]
*  10 million undocumented being targeted by the military, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1992.08s)]
*  4 billion additional carbon emissions, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1994.08s)]
*  tons of carbon emissions. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1996.08s)]
*  Let me speak to that. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=1998.08s)]
*  Because it is largely under Joe Biden [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2000.08s)]
*  that we have massively expanded these [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2002.08s)]
*  liquid natural gas export facilities. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2004.08s)]
*  It's not been a good record on the Democrats. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2006.08s)]
*  Oh, it's horrible. But it's worse under Trump. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2008.08s)]
*  You never do the worst. No, it's actually not. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2010.08s)]
*  You always say they're the same. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2012.08s)]
*  But you're not saying that the Trump policy [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2014.08s)]
*  is not a good record than Kamala Harris and Joe Biden? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2016.08s)]
*  Well, I think that Biden exceeded Trump [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2018.08s)]
*  in terms of fossil fuel emissions. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2020.08s)]
*  And the same is true for Obama having exceeded Bush. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2022.08s)]
*  So we hear a lot of... The man says climate change is a hoax [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2024.08s)]
*  and you think he's the same... It's not about the rhetoric. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2026.08s)]
*  It's about the policy. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2028.08s)]
*  Okay, so what is the Trump policy for the environment? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2030.08s)]
*  To pull out of the Paris climate change agreement? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2032.08s)]
*  To increase oil and drilling? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2034.08s)]
*  Okay, nonetheless, that was his policy. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2036.08s)]
*  To deregulate? And yet Joe Biden, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2038.08s)]
*  who came in saying not another acre of public land, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2040.08s)]
*  under the inflation... I'm not a defender [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2042.08s)]
*  of Joe Biden's climate record. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2044.08s)]
*  Let me read to you what Michael Mann says. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2046.08s)]
*  You have the notion that somehow Trump is terrible [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2048.08s)]
*  and the Democrats are good. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2050.08s)]
*  So I'm simply trying to school you... [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2052.08s)]
*  With respect, Jill Stein, with respect, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2054.08s)]
*  that is a falsehood. I am trying to school you to get beyond [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2056.08s)]
*  the rhetoric of the Democrats. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2058.08s)]
*  Should I say everything the Democrats say is fine? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2060.08s)]
*  You should really watch the show, see the guests who come on the show? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2062.08s)]
*  But that's what you're saying right now. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2064.08s)]
*  You're telling me about Trump's terrible rhetoric [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2066.08s)]
*  is that the Democrats are okay. They're not. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2068.08s)]
*  You know Michael Mann, he's a professor of climate science [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2070.08s)]
*  at the University of Pennsylvania. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2072.08s)]
*  He says the climate... I'm sure... [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2074.08s)]
*  That's the kind of thing Donald Trump... He's a scientist. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2076.08s)]
*  The climate is a great example of the perfect being [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2078.08s)]
*  the enemy of the good. With Harris, he says the record's not good. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2080.08s)]
*  We have a fighting chance. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2082.08s)]
*  With Trump, it's pretty close to game over. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2084.08s)]
*  We have a fighting chance when we get out [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2086.08s)]
*  and make a fighting chance. Under Richard Nixon [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2088.08s)]
*  and his very conservative Supreme Court, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2090.08s)]
*  we were active on abortion rights. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2092.08s)]
*  So you think you could organize under Trump [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2094.08s)]
*  to get climate action? [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2096.08s)]
*  Only climate action, on peace action, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2098.08s)]
*  on anti-genocide action. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2100.08s)]
*  While he invokes the Interrection Act, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2102.08s)]
*  shoots at protesters. Movements go to die [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2104.08s)]
*  under Democrats rule. You think there's going to be free protests [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2106.08s)]
*  under a second Trump term? Well, we haven't seen them [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2108.08s)]
*  under Democrats. Under Democrats, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2110.08s)]
*  these movements go silent. We saw massive [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2112.08s)]
*  record protests for Gaza in this city. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2114.08s)]
*  You think Donald Trump's going to deport people? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2116.08s)]
*  We saw university presidents being deported [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2118.08s)]
*  for saying simple things. Did we not see record protests though [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2120.08s)]
*  in this city? Listen, we absolutely [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2122.08s)]
*  saw protests. This is a very strange argument. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2124.08s)]
*  We saw protests under Trump. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2126.08s)]
*  The argument is that Democrats are bad, which I agree with, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2128.08s)]
*  therefore Trump can't be worse. Yes, he can. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2130.08s)]
*  He can invoke the Interrection Act. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2132.08s)]
*  Hold on one second. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2134.08s)]
*  This is a plain caricature. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2136.08s)]
*  You're both talking at the same time. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2138.08s)]
*  May I? Yeah. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2140.08s)]
*  No one is saying that Trump cannot be worse. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2142.08s)]
*  Sounds like you both are saying that. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2144.08s)]
*  No one is actually in point of fact saying that. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2146.08s)]
*  What we're saying is that we are not responsible [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2148.08s)]
*  for the Democrats' failures to create [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2150.08s)]
*  a meaningful alternative to Team Red. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2152.08s)]
*  We are not responsible for the Democrats' failures to create [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2154.08s)]
*  a meaningful alternative to Team Red. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2156.08s)]
*  We are not responsible for the Democrats' failures to create [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2158.08s)]
*  a meaningful alternative to Team Red. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2160.08s)]
*  We do the work of actually providing [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2162.08s)]
*  a meaningful alternative for the American people. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2164.08s)]
*  One, we will consolidate power in a third party [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2166.08s)]
*  which will give Americans choice in future elections. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2168.08s)]
*  And two, we will provide [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2170.08s)]
*  maximal leverage on the few adults [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2172.08s)]
*  that are left in the room on Team Blue [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2174.08s)]
*  that will hopefully push them to behave like responsible adults. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2176.08s)]
*  If it gives us Team Red, that's fine. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2178.08s)]
*  That's a price worth paying. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2180.08s)]
*  So let's talk about records. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2182.08s)]
*  Mehdi, we are not going to build an alternative overnight. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2184.08s)]
*  We're going to have to build it. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2186.08s)]
*  And that may mean getting to 5%, then 10%, then 15%. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2188.08s)]
*  And I'm going to come back to that point later in the interview. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2190.08s)]
*  And what is really clear is that [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2192.08s)]
*  we are headed over the cliff right now [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2194.08s)]
*  very clearly under Democrat policies [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2196.08s)]
*  as well as Republican. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2198.08s)]
*  And I think we're guaranteed over the cliff [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2200.08s)]
*  if a fascist comes in, a domestic terrorist to quote. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2202.08s)]
*  So Jill, let me talk about some record stuff. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2204.08s)]
*  Because let's put Donald Trump to one side for a moment. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2206.08s)]
*  Let's talk about your record. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2208.08s)]
*  I know how good your record has been on Gaza [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2210.08s)]
*  and how many Palestinians like you. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2212.08s)]
*  But a lot of Syrians would say your record was as bad on Syria [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2214.08s)]
*  as it has been good on Gaza. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2216.08s)]
*  Now you oppose a genocide, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2218.08s)]
*  then you were indifferent to a genocide. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2220.08s)]
*  May I clarify? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2222.08s)]
*  Let me finish the question, and you can. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2224.08s)]
*  You said in November 2015, as Assad and Putin [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2226.08s)]
*  were massacring Syrians in their tens of thousands, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2228.08s)]
*  quote, the US should be working with Syria, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2230.08s)]
*  Russia, and Iran to restore all of Syria [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2232.08s)]
*  to control by the government. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2234.08s)]
*  That's the Assad government. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2236.08s)]
*  You seem to have a lot of things online [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2238.08s)]
*  that you don't approve that go out. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2240.08s)]
*  You've numbered too many. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2242.08s)]
*  One from 2015 and an Instagram like? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2244.08s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2246.08s)]
*  Be serious. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2248.08s)]
*  And this was all of one sentence [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2250.08s)]
*  in a press release [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2252.08s)]
*  that got posted on a website. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2254.08s)]
*  I never, ever said anything [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2256.08s)]
*  in support of Assad. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2258.08s)]
*  You picked a running mate who was a supporter of Assad. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2260.08s)]
*  The predecessor to Butch was a guy called [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2262.08s)]
*  Ajamu Baraka who suggested [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2264.08s)]
*  Assad's election victories were legitimate [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2266.08s)]
*  and then went on a trip to Syria [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2268.08s)]
*  to go with a bunch of pro-Assad activists. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2270.08s)]
*  That was your running mate. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2272.08s)]
*  You can understand why Syrian Americans were a little bit upset with you. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2274.08s)]
*  Well, that was not a statement on my behalf. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2276.08s)]
*  I have not been disappeared at Syria. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2278.08s)]
*  I have not said a thing [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2280.08s)]
*  in support of Assad. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2282.08s)]
*  And we clarified immediately, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2284.08s)]
*  it was covered by the Hill, that that was a mistake. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2286.08s)]
*  We took it down, we apologized for it, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2288.08s)]
*  and made clear that we strongly support [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2290.08s)]
*  the sovereignty [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2292.08s)]
*  and self-determination [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2294.08s)]
*  exactly of the Syrian people [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2296.08s)]
*  to determine their future. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2298.08s)]
*  Do you have any qualms as a Muslim American about running alongside someone [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2300.08s)]
*  who a lot of Muslim Americans, especially Syrian Americans, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2302.08s)]
*  have publicly criticized for the stance of Assad? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2304.08s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2306.08s)]
*  The first set of phone calls that I made when this offer was extended to me [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2308.08s)]
*  was in the Palestinian community, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2310.08s)]
*  the Arab American community, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2312.08s)]
*  I taught at the University of Michigan. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2314.08s)]
*  The Syrian Americans? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2316.08s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. And the questions were posed to me. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2318.08s)]
*  And I asked Jill pointedly about this [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2320.08s)]
*  and I actually showed them the documentation. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2322.08s)]
*  All of the people that had questions, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2324.08s)]
*  their fears were assuaged. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2326.08s)]
*  So I went in with an absolutely clear conscience on this question. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2328.08s)]
*  I 100% believe in Jill's position [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2330.08s)]
*  with respect to not just Palestinian Americans [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2332.08s)]
*  but with respect to Muslims' right to self-determination. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2334.08s)]
*  And I believe in those things [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2336.08s)]
*  because when I asked her in an Instagram Live [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2338.08s)]
*  about what the overall foreign policy vision [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2340.08s)]
*  of Jill Stein was, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2342.08s)]
*  it was actually about dismantling [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2344.08s)]
*  these imperial apparatuses. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2346.08s)]
*  They were not going to be able to do that. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2348.08s)]
*  They were going to be dismantling these imperial apparatuses [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2350.08s)]
*  that have tormented Muslims for so long. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2352.08s)]
*  The Iraq War, Afghanistan War. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2354.08s)]
*  And just so you know, we will be going, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2356.08s)]
*  I won't mention what particular day, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2358.08s)]
*  but we will be on 9-11. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2360.08s)]
*  We will be in Michigan [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2362.08s)]
*  to do a 9-11 memorial march [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2364.08s)]
*  and we will talk about [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2366.08s)]
*  the dreadful consequences [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2368.08s)]
*  of this tragic day [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2370.08s)]
*  and we will have a moment of silence [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2372.08s)]
*  for all of those lost souls [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2374.08s)]
*  and then we will have a moment of silence [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2376.08s)]
*  for the hundreds of thousands of people [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2378.08s)]
*  who had their lives taken unjustly [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2380.08s)]
*  in the imperialist extractive wars [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2382.08s)]
*  that were fought in those names. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2384.08s)]
*  So I'm glad you brought that up. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2386.08s)]
*  Millions, millions, thank you. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2388.08s)]
*  You have been very eloquent and bold. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2390.08s)]
*  We began the interview with me saying [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2392.08s)]
*  you have the strongest position on Gaza by a mile. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2394.08s)]
*  But it's easy to condemn what America is doing. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2396.08s)]
*  The critics are saying it's what Russia or Syria does [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2398.08s)]
*  that you haven't condemned [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2400.08s)]
*  and they point out, as you know, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2402.08s)]
*  that you went to Russia in December 2015. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2404.08s)]
*  You went to Russia in January 2015 [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2406.08s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2408.08s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2410.08s)]
*  I did what JFK said. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2412.08s)]
*  In the wake of his illegal annexation of Crimea, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2414.08s)]
*  you didn't harshly criticize Putin, they say. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2416.08s)]
*  In fact, you put out a video of you in Moscow [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2418.08s)]
*  in Red Square harshly criticizing [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2420.08s)]
*  not Putin, but American foreign policy in Russia. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2422.08s)]
*  You didn't criticize Russia in that video. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2424.08s)]
*  No, actually, I did. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2426.08s)]
*  You criticized America. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2428.08s)]
*  Not in that video, two and a half minute video [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2430.08s)]
*  you put out from Red Square. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2432.08s)]
*  You put out a video of you in Moscow [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2434.08s)]
*  in the wake of the Russian imperialism. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2436.08s)]
*  I agree with all of the Russian imperialism [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2438.08s)]
*  and all of the Russian nation, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2440.08s)]
*  all of which I agree with, by the way. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2442.08s)]
*  But in Moscow, shouldn't you say something [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2444.08s)]
*  about the Russian imperialism? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2446.08s)]
*  Well, in fact, I did. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2448.08s)]
*  And had the speech not been taken down, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2450.08s)]
*  it lived on the Internet, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2452.08s)]
*  on the RT channel. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2454.08s)]
*  My remarks... [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2456.08s)]
*  You called out the Russian imperialist... [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2458.08s)]
*  Yes, I actually did call that out. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2460.08s)]
*  I mean, it's a conference of media [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2462.08s)]
*  from around the world. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2464.08s)]
*  What is a Russia Today conference, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2466.08s)]
*  which is a propaganda channel for Putin? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2468.08s)]
*  Well, yes, in the same way that the BBC [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2470.08s)]
*  is a propaganda channel for Putin. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2472.08s)]
*  It's not the same way. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2474.08s)]
*  The MSNBC is a propaganda channel for Team Blue. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2476.08s)]
*  Yes, but aren't the American people [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2478.08s)]
*  entitled to decide, you know, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2480.08s)]
*  what propaganda they're going to listen to? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2482.08s)]
*  I'm not saying you should be banned from going on this wandering. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2484.08s)]
*  When our corporate media will not cover us, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2486.08s)]
*  yes, then we do have to embrace [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2488.08s)]
*  whatever media we can get. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2490.08s)]
*  And you didn't feel you should criticize Putin? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2492.08s)]
*  Actually, I did. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2494.08s)]
*  Yes, so he was not at that conference, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2496.08s)]
*  but he heard it. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2498.08s)]
*  He was sitting three feet away. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2500.08s)]
*  That was not the conference. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2502.08s)]
*  That was a dinner afterwards. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2504.08s)]
*  There were no translators, there was no introduction. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2506.08s)]
*  Vladimir Putin speaks English. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2508.08s)]
*  He was there for five minutes before he gave a speech in Russian. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2510.08s)]
*  If Joe Biden was sitting at a table with you five minutes, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2512.08s)]
*  you wouldn't call him out on Gaza? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2514.08s)]
*  If Benjamin Netanyahu was sitting at a table with you, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2516.08s)]
*  then you would call him out on Gaza? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2518.08s)]
*  But if he is unavailable, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2520.08s)]
*  if he's across the table and there's just screaming noise, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2522.08s)]
*  what, you're going to go shout over the table? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2524.08s)]
*  You're telling me if you sat at a table [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2526.08s)]
*  with Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu for five minutes, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2528.08s)]
*  you wouldn't say anything to them? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2530.08s)]
*  Well, this is why I made the point [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2532.08s)]
*  to focus my speech on these remarks [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2534.08s)]
*  and to criticize Russia for basically [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2536.08s)]
*  following in the US footsteps by bombing Syria. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2538.08s)]
*  So here's what bothers us. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2540.08s)]
*  Let me finish this conversation. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2542.08s)]
*  If I can understand though. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2544.08s)]
*  Great, Jill was. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2546.08s)]
*  On the day you posted that video on the 17th of December 2015, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2548.08s)]
*  Russian warplanes bombed a residential area in Aleppo, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2550.08s)]
*  killed eight people, including four kids. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2552.08s)]
*  Ten days after you went to that dinner in Russia, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2554.08s)]
*  on 20th of December, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2556.08s)]
*  Russian warplanes bombed a marketplace in Idlib, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2558.08s)]
*  killed over 40 Syrian people in the area. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2560.08s)]
*  Did you ever condemn any of that? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2562.08s)]
*  Did you feel bad about being in Russia [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2564.08s)]
*  talking about peace while they're dropping bombs? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2566.08s)]
*  Well, that was the point. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2568.08s)]
*  That was one of the points in my actual remarks. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2570.08s)]
*  Well, whose has worked? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2572.08s)]
*  Yes, but you know, I was also on that, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2574.08s)]
*  in that same trip. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2576.08s)]
*  I was in Paris talking with Jeremy Corbyn. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2578.08s)]
*  I was talking with the Chinese deputy negotiator on climate. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2580.08s)]
*  So am I going to change the world by having a one-minute conversation with world leaders? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2582.08s)]
*  No, and more often than not, you can't even get their attention. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2584.08s)]
*  But what I was able to do was to put on record three issues, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2586.08s)]
*  three top issues. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2588.08s)]
*  One was a global Green New Deal. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2590.08s)]
*  A second was a peace offender. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2592.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2594.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2596.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2598.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2600.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2602.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2604.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2606.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2608.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2610.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2612.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2614.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2616.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2618.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2620.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2622.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2624.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2626.08s)]
*  And I was able to do that. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2628.08s)]
*  Yes, in so many words. Yes, we have said as much. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2630.08s)]
*  Does that mean in so many words? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2632.08s)]
*  You called Netanyahu one, which I think he is. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2634.08s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2636.08s)]
*  But is Putin a war criminal? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2638.08s)]
*  So what we said about Putin was that his invasion of Ukraine is criminal. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2640.08s)]
*  It's a criminal and murderous war. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2642.08s)]
*  And he's a war criminal who should be on trial? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2644.08s)]
*  Well, by implication. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2646.08s)]
*  You're struggling here to say something very simple. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2648.08s)]
*  This is why people have their doubts about you and Russia. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2650.08s)]
*  Why is Benjamin Netanyahu a war criminal but not Vladimir Putin? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2652.08s)]
*  Why is Benjamin Netanyahu a war criminal but not Vladimir Putin? [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2654.08s)]
*  Well, as John F. Kennedy said, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2656.08s)]
*  we must not be afraid to... [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2658.08s)]
*  We must not negotiate out of fear and we must not fear to negotiate. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2660.08s)]
*  We must not negotiate out of fear and we must not fear to negotiate. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2662.08s)]
*  So if you want to be an effective world leader, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2664.08s)]
*  you don't start by name-calling and hurling epithets. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2666.08s)]
*  So how will President Stein negotiate with Israel, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2668.08s)]
*  then, if you've called Netanyahu a war criminal? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2670.08s)]
*  Well, because he very clearly is a war criminal. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2672.08s)]
*  Oh, so Putin clearly isn't a war criminal. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2674.08s)]
*  Well, we don't have a decision put it this way. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2676.08s)]
*  By the International Criminal Court... [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2678.08s)]
*  Yes, we do. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2680.08s)]
*  Yes, actually, you're wrong. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2682.08s)]
*  There isn't yet an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2684.08s)]
*  Why is Putin not a war criminal but Netanyahu is? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2686.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2688.08s)]
*  Well, let me say this. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2690.08s)]
*  We are sponsoring that war. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2692.08s)]
*  We are sponsoring Netanyahu. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2694.08s)]
*  He is our dog in this fight. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2696.08s)]
*  That is why we have a responsibility to pull him back. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2698.08s)]
*  No disagreement from me at all. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2700.08s)]
*  But that does not answer my question. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2702.08s)]
*  With Russia, it's far more complicated. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2704.08s)]
*  Whether we sponsor them or not is irrelevant. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2706.08s)]
*  Either you're a war criminal or you're not. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2708.08s)]
*  Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2710.08s)]
*  In so many words, yes, he is. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2712.08s)]
*  If you think he is... [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2714.08s)]
*  It doesn't matter what I think. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2716.08s)]
*  I'm asking what you think already. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2718.08s)]
*  If you are a world leader, you don't begin your conversation [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2720.08s)]
*  by calling someone a war criminal. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2722.08s)]
*  So why have you called Biden and Netanyahu war criminals? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2724.08s)]
*  Because we have a clear strategy. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2726.08s)]
*  And we have a very strong support across the world. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2728.08s)]
*  Is Bashar al-Assad a war criminal in your view? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2730.08s)]
*  In my humble opinion, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2732.08s)]
*  as an individual, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2734.08s)]
*  I would class their actions as criminal [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2736.08s)]
*  without any question. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2738.08s)]
*  What I would say also in response [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2740.08s)]
*  to affirm my sister's soldier, Dr. Jill Stein's point, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2742.08s)]
*  is that we have a differential relationship of responsibility. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2746.08s)]
*  Okay? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2750.08s)]
*  The differential relationship of responsibility is as follows. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2752.08s)]
*  This is our genocide in Gaza. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2756.08s)]
*  Israel is our landed aircraft carrier. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2758.08s)]
*  We provide 70% of the arms and munitions. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2762.08s)]
*  Everyone wants to pin this on Netanyahu [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2766.08s)]
*  and the right wing in the Zionist entity, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2768.08s)]
*  but in point of fact, this is an American genocide. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2770.08s)]
*  And therefore, we have a different kind of responsibility [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2774.08s)]
*  to call out people that are in our own house. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2776.08s)]
*  We clean our own house first. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2780.08s)]
*  And if we are running for leaders of the free world, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2782.08s)]
*  as you say, without the qualifications, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2784.08s)]
*  then there is no point in pissing in Vladimir Putin's cereal. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2786.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2790.08s)]
*  And can I add that we have ginned up that war in Ukraine. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2792.08s)]
*  We had everything to do with it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2794.08s)]
*  I'm not saying we haven't. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2796.08s)]
*  That wasn't my question. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2798.08s)]
*  That doesn't excuse Putin. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2800.08s)]
*  In Israel, it's pretty clear cut that there is a murderous genocide going on. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2802.08s)]
*  War crimes are war crimes regardless of who commits them. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2808.08s)]
*  Well, if we were to call out every war criminal, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2810.08s)]
*  we would also have to be calling out Barack Obama. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2814.08s)]
*  We have to call out Dick Cheney. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2816.08s)]
*  I have. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2818.08s)]
*  All three of us have, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2820.08s)]
*  but it seems to me I'm the only one who's willing to call out Putin at this table. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2822.08s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2824.08s)]
*  You didn't hear me? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2826.08s)]
*  You said they were both crimes. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2828.08s)]
*  No, I said they were both criminals. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2830.08s)]
*  And I have called them a criminal as well. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2832.08s)]
*  Let's move on from there. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2834.08s)]
*  Hard work getting to this. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2836.08s)]
*  I understand the point you're making, although I don't agree with it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2838.08s)]
*  I don't think that moves us forward in solving the war in Ukraine. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2840.08s)]
*  We need to sit down and we need to negotiate without name-calling. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2842.08s)]
*  I agree on that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2844.08s)]
*  Before we run out of time, let's talk domestic. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2846.08s)]
*  And I take that very seriously. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2848.08s)]
*  Let's talk about our chance at peace here by name-calling. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2850.08s)]
*  Let's talk domestic policy. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2852.08s)]
*  I think we need to talk about that. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2854.08s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2856.08s)]
*  What would you say is the policy issue [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2858.08s)]
*  you believe your platform is best on [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2860.08s)]
*  compared to the Democrats or the Republicans? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2862.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2864.08s)]
*  So the way that I would answer this question [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2866.08s)]
*  actually emerges from the first conversation [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2868.08s)]
*  that Jill and I had. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2870.08s)]
*  And Jill was giving a layout of two things. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2872.08s)]
*  So first I'll just provide a little bit of background [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2874.08s)]
*  and then I'll answer the question directly. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2876.08s)]
*  So I just made a post about Kamala Harris [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2878.08s)]
*  and how Kamala Harris had been asked a question about reparations [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2880.08s)]
*  and she said, I will never do anything that only helps black people. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2882.08s)]
*  That's the way that she said it. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2884.08s)]
*  So I asked Jill about reparations [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2886.08s)]
*  and Jill said they act as though it's an incalculable amount [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2888.08s)]
*  but it's been calculated many times by specialists. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2890.08s)]
*  It's between $10 and $13 trillion U.S. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2892.08s)]
*  and I'm in favor of cash payments to the descendants of the enslaved. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2894.08s)]
*  Powerful, right? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2896.08s)]
*  So from the beginning, a conversation about [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2898.08s)]
*  transformative intervention [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2900.08s)]
*  to alleviate the wealth gap in African-American communities. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2902.08s)]
*  But the real answer to your question is [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2904.08s)]
*  that we need to talk about the wealth gap [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2906.08s)]
*  and the wealth gap in African-American communities. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2908.08s)]
*  But the real answer to your question [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2910.08s)]
*  actually came when we were talking about drug policy. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2912.08s)]
*  Okay? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2914.08s)]
*  And when Dr. Jill started to talk about [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2916.08s)]
*  how we treat the drug crisis in America now [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2918.08s)]
*  as a Green Party, as a public health problem [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2920.08s)]
*  rather than a problem to be solved by the carceral state, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2922.08s)]
*  I mentioned the fact that my wife is Mexican-American [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2924.08s)]
*  because Jill said [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2926.08s)]
*  that if you actually legalize these substances [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2928.08s)]
*  you disempower the cartels in Central America [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2930.08s)]
*  that are responsible for all of these political assassinations. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2932.08s)]
*  You take away a lot of the push factor [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2934.08s)]
*  that you have to do to get the money. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2936.08s)]
*  You take away a lot of the push factor [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2938.08s)]
*  that is involved in the so-called migration crisis. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2940.08s)]
*  And immediately my head starts to turn [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2942.08s)]
*  and I'm like, oh, my God, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2944.08s)]
*  we have a magic bullet [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2946.08s)]
*  that solves the problem of my cousin [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2948.08s)]
*  being locked up for three years [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2950.08s)]
*  on petty drug charges, right? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2952.08s)]
*  And that solved my wife's problem [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2954.08s)]
*  of her mom not being able to see her brother [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2956.08s)]
*  for 23 years [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2958.08s)]
*  because she came here undocumented. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2960.08s)]
*  That if we just take a simple [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2962.08s)]
*  common-sense solution [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2964.08s)]
*  that is good for white folks in Appalachia, right? [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2966.08s)]
*  We treat drugs as a public health problem, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2968.08s)]
*  then we can take the carceral state, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2970.08s)]
*  migration policy, and social housing [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2972.08s)]
*  all in one, and we treat this [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2974.08s)]
*  with domestic policies that actually [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2976.08s)]
*  serve the American people rather than serve the 1%. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2978.08s)]
*  So let me repeat before we run out of time, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2980.08s)]
*  let me repeat what I said at the start of this interview, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2982.08s)]
*  which feels like a long time ago. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2984.08s)]
*  A lot of your policies are great. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2986.08s)]
*  You said earlier about Nora Erekat, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2988.08s)]
*  maybe she doesn't understand how politics works. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2990.08s)]
*  Do you understand how politics works, Jill Stein? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2992.08s)]
*  You said earlier about the [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2994.08s)]
*  national security system, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2996.08s)]
*  a lot of the parties, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=2998.08s)]
*  Medicare for all, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3000.08s)]
*  higher taxes on the wealthy, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3002.08s)]
*  student debt forgiveness, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3004.08s)]
*  a higher minimum wage, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3006.08s)]
*  all on the Green Party website. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3008.08s)]
*  I looked at it, and I said, great, love this. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3010.08s)]
*  But how do you get them passed into law? [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3012.08s)]
*  Let's say you win the presidency, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3014.08s)]
*  which I don't think you can. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3016.08s)]
*  Let's say you do, by some miracle. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3018.08s)]
*  Biden, to be fair, tried a lot of doing, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3020.08s)]
*  in the current system. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3022.08s)]
*  In the current system, yes. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3023.08s)]
*  So hold on. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3024.08s)]
*  If Biden couldn't get it past his own party, the Republicans, they hate, both parties hate [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3025.08s)]
*  you. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3028.44s)]
*  How are you going to get through Congress those policies? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3029.44s)]
*  Well, remember when Barack Obama got elected, you know, with his army of grassroots advocates, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3030.44s)]
*  he basically sent them home when he appointed Larry Summers as his Treasury Secretary. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3036.16s)]
*  It was clear whose interests he is serving and did serve. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3041.08s)]
*  And that goes true down the line of Democrats. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3045.44s)]
*  This is a bought and paid for political system. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3047.96s)]
*  But to be fair, they did try and do a lot of this stuff. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3050.04s)]
*  Biden tried to do student debt. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3052.04s)]
*  The Supreme Court stopped him. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3053.04s)]
*  Well, he tried, but through a very fallible mechanism that was a setup for being stopped [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3054.44s)]
*  by the Supreme Court. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3058.7599999999998s)]
*  But suffice it to say, it's very hard to move anything to that system. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3060.6s)]
*  And we know from, you know, academic studies and just the real world that it is not the [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3063.96s)]
*  interests of everyday people for health care, for housing, for education. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3068.82s)]
*  That doesn't matter one bit. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3072.72s)]
*  You know, it's serving big donors that does. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3074.0s)]
*  What we will do is we will enact some really critical measures that the president has authority [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3076.3599999999997s)]
*  over just by virtue of the bully pulpit. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3082.9199999999996s)]
*  So let me tell you what we will do. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3084.6s)]
*  On day one, we will undertake an antitrust lawsuit against the consolidated corporate [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3086.52s)]
*  media so that we can break up media and encourage independent reporting like what we're seeing [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3091.56s)]
*  here and relieve that bar of censorship because the First Amendment is first for very good [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3095.96s)]
*  reasons. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3100.48s)]
*  So you do that by executive order because you're not going to get a bill? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3101.48s)]
*  No, but you can get your Department of Justice to basically undertake the case. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3103.2s)]
*  But the things I mentioned, which help Medicare for all. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3107.2s)]
*  Right, so let me get to that. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3110.2s)]
*  We will also once again begin town hall meetings, which have been ended. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3111.48s)]
*  They really don't take place now because politicians are too busy talking to their donors, not [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3116.96s)]
*  to their constituents. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3122.3599999999997s)]
*  So we will shame politicians into having to meet with their... [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3123.64s)]
*  Have you met some of these politicians? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3128.12s)]
*  You can't shame the shameless. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3129.12s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3131.04s)]
*  But when you have the bully pulpit of the... [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3132.04s)]
*  To be fair to the Democrats again, there was a massive campaign, as you know Jill Stein, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3133.04s)]
*  for voting rights, right? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3137.52s)]
*  For voting rights. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3138.52s)]
*  There was a massive grassroots campaign across the country and yet Joe Manchin, one guy, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3139.52s)]
*  blocked voting rights reform. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3143.68s)]
*  Well, who gave Joe Manchin power? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3144.68s)]
*  This is why we have to put power back into the hands of people, which is why I want to [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3146.44s)]
*  name two things here. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3149.88s)]
*  One is town hall meetings and the other one is congressional hearings. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3150.96s)]
*  And likewise, decorporatizing the media. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3154.68s)]
*  Congressional hearings, you don't have any parties in Congress. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3156.12s)]
*  See, that's one of the criticisms of the Green Party, is that you run for president every [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3158.88s)]
*  four years but you've not built up a presence in state legislatures. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3161.8s)]
*  Hold on, let me finish your question. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3165.0s)]
*  Can I speak to that? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3166.0s)]
*  Gubernatorial offices? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3167.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3168.0s)]
*  Please speak to it. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3169.0s)]
*  Or in the federal legislature, in Congress. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3170.0s)]
*  But what we have done... [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3171.48s)]
*  But Jill Stein runs every four years. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3172.48s)]
*  So let me say... [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3173.84s)]
*  But where is the building? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3174.84s)]
*  So we have tripled our vote, for one thing, from 2012 to 2016. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3176.84s)]
*  But let me say beyond that, what are you comparing us to? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3179.96s)]
*  You've got to compare us to other grassroots parties that are not corrupted, that do not [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3183.08s)]
*  take the money. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3187.3199999999997s)]
*  The Green Party in Germany is in government, in England is in parliament. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3188.3199999999997s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3189.3199999999997s)]
*  Green parties around the world do... [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3190.3199999999997s)]
*  But we're talking the US. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3191.3199999999997s)]
*  As very serious parties. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3192.3199999999997s)]
*  You're not seen as a serious party. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3193.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, we do not have proportional representation here. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3194.3199999999997s)]
*  In this country... [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3196.7999999999997s)]
*  Nor does the UK. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3197.7999999999997s)]
*  So small parties, grassroots, people-powered parties in this country are dead within 10 [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3198.7999999999997s)]
*  years. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3203.56s)]
*  They're done. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3204.56s)]
*  So they don't even have an opportunity to build... [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3205.56s)]
*  But by that logic, why run for president then? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3206.56s)]
*  Because we have to... [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3208.68s)]
*  Because we're going over the cliff. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3209.68s)]
*  Because we need to stop the genocide. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3211.48s)]
*  But wouldn't you be in a stronger... [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3212.48s)]
*  Because we can't keep spending our money on our military... [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3213.48s)]
*  Please, before you add up to that, one more data point, please. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3214.48s)]
*  Sure, go ahead. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3215.8s)]
*  And then you deal with both. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3216.8s)]
*  The argument is that you haven't built up a presence. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3217.8s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3220.8s)]
*  That's entirely wrong. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3221.8s)]
*  We have built up a presence. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3222.8s)]
*  We are the alternative. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3223.8s)]
*  How many state legislatures do you have? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3224.8s)]
*  So we have over 1,500 local elected. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3225.8s)]
*  That's not what I asked. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3228.8s)]
*  So wait a minute. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3229.8s)]
*  This is about building. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3230.8s)]
*  We have been on the ballot for 20 years. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3231.8s)]
*  That's not what I asked. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3232.8s)]
*  How many state legislatures do you have? [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3233.8s)]
*  The next best compared to us is the Peace and Freedom Party, which had 14 ballot lines [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3234.8s)]
*  which they lost 20 years ago. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3240.04s)]
*  I don't like interrupting you. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3241.04s)]
*  You're not answering the question. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3242.04s)]
*  How many state legislatures do you have? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3243.04s)]
*  We're competing. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3244.04s)]
*  We have had a handful. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3245.6s)]
*  But right now? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3246.6s)]
*  But let's say we need to stop the Democratic Party from throwing us off the ballot. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3247.6s)]
*  We need to stop the Democratic Party from hanging onto our public front. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3252.36s)]
*  So let me add a data point and then bring in Butch who's waiting patiently. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3255.36s)]
*  We can fix this, but we need to get the word out because when we do get the word out... [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3257.36s)]
*  We put you here for an hour to get the word out. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3261.36s)]
*  And we need to multiply this a thousand times. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3263.36s)]
*  Understood. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3266.36s)]
*  And this is how we get here. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3267.36s)]
*  Butch, the argument is you don't have any members of state legislatures. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3268.36s)]
*  You don't have any members of Congress. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3270.96s)]
*  You don't have any governors. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3272.56s)]
*  So even if you were somehow to get into the presidency, you don't have that organized [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3274.08s)]
*  elected movement that you need. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3278.08s)]
*  You can't just have people on the streets. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3279.08s)]
*  You need lawmakers. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3280.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3281.08s)]
*  And you've joined a party which has shrunk over 20 years. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3282.08s)]
*  The Green Party had 319,000 members in 2004. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3285.08s)]
*  Today it has 245,000 members. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3290.08s)]
*  Instead of growing, you've shrunk. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3292.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3293.08s)]
*  So you're talking about the kind of first golden era of the Green Party with Ralph Nader [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3294.08s)]
*  at its head. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3300.08s)]
*  What I would say, just to be clear, is that I joined this struggle for the long term. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3302.6s)]
*  I came to this office from scouting out our national headquarters here in Washington, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3309.6s)]
*  D.C. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3314.6s)]
*  You are going to get sick of seeing me around here, Mehdi. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3315.6s)]
*  You're going to get sick of seeing Dr. Jill around here. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3317.6s)]
*  We don't have to discuss it anytime. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3319.6s)]
*  This is a moment where all of the years that the Green Party has been doing work, people [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3320.6s)]
*  like Annie Young, Park and Recreation Board in the city of Minneapolis for 20 plus years, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3325.6s)]
*  a public servant. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3331.12s)]
*  We've got public servants like that all over this country that have never had the kind [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3332.12s)]
*  of shine on their work that they are now seeing. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3336.7599999999998s)]
*  So we are already having the conversations about the congressional runs, the gubernatorial [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3339.7599999999998s)]
*  runs. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3344.52s)]
*  And if, as you say, we only have that one in 1,000 shot at the chin of Trump, right? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3345.52s)]
*  And let's say we miss. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3352.52s)]
*  Let's say we don't land that punch. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3353.6s)]
*  Let's say we don't get the Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston outcome that I as a black Muslim [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3355.08s)]
*  believe we have a shot at getting. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3360.2400000000002s)]
*  What's to stop Dr. Jill Stein or Professor Butch Ware from running for a gubernatorial [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  position or a congressional position in an off-year election? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3368.16s)]
*  I am in this fight. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3371.16s)]
*  We are in this fight to build power. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3372.84s)]
*  I think a lot of your critics would say they wish you'd been doing that all these years [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3375.32s)]
*  instead of these pointless presidential races. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3378.32s)]
*  That takes resources, brother. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3380.84s)]
*  And you know that these people are outspending us at a million to one. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3382.28s)]
*  Last question to you, Jill Stein. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3386.32s)]
*  I don't think, and most people don't think, and I suspect neither of you think you're [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3387.72s)]
*  going to win the presidency in November, but you are making a lot of noise. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3390.52s)]
*  You are getting a lot of new supporters, especially over Gaza. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3393.16s)]
*  What do you plan to do with the new support you've got beyond November? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3395.9199999999996s)]
*  Butch touched on it. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3399.72s)]
*  What is your plan for growth? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3400.7599999999998s)]
*  So generically, we're going to be very focused on local races. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3402.16s)]
*  And bringing these new constituents who are newly politically active, who are newly active [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3406.8399999999997s)]
*  in grassroots politics to basically help build leadership, to help build candidates, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3412.0s)]
*  and help build networks to support them. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3418.36s)]
*  So they will be starting mainly at the local level, but we will be building up from there. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3420.32s)]
*  This is the first time. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3424.6s)]
*  You know, the Green Party has been ahead of the curve on climate change, on militarism, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3425.6s)]
*  on genocide, on Medicare. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3430.08s)]
*  And Medicare for All, which was launched by Ralph Nader. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3436.24s)]
*  Actually, the whole progressive democratic agenda was launched by the Green Party. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3438.48s)]
*  So we absolutely will. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3442.2400000000002s)]
*  And the progress that we have made so far is not trivial and it's not to be discounted. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3444.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's been made against an extremely steep playing field that's controlled by corporate [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3450.32s)]
*  America and the oligarchs. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3455.0s)]
*  Undeniable. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3456.0s)]
*  The playing field is bad. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3457.0s)]
*  But the playing field is where we are, and it's a playing field that could deliver us [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3458.0s)]
*  Trump or Harris. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3459.28s)]
*  I'm going to try one last time. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3460.28s)]
*  One last time. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3461.28s)]
*  I'll give you the last word. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3462.28s)]
*  I asked you this in 2016, and it went horribly badly afterwards. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3463.28s)]
*  Let me ask you this again. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3466.4s)]
*  Would you tell your supporters at home, vote green everywhere, but in those three swing [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3467.84s)]
*  states, vote against a domestic terrorist? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3471.2400000000002s)]
*  I would say it's very important for us to stand up and demand the democracy that we [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3474.8s)]
*  deserve. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3479.88s)]
*  We should not be in the business of endorsing genocide. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3480.88s)]
*  And I would say forget the lesser evil. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3483.1200000000003s)]
*  Good luck figuring out which one is the greater evil. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3484.84s)]
*  When one of them is doing a genocide right now, the other one may do it in the future. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3487.56s)]
*  I think the other one would do a genocide and domestic terrorism. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3489.76s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3491.76s)]
*  We will have to leave it there. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3492.76s)]
*  I was giving June Stade the last word. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3493.76s)]
*  I think we have domestic terrorism right now when we have 80 cop cities that are being [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3496.76s)]
*  built around the country. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3501.32s)]
*  This is where we'll never agree. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3502.32s)]
*  You can't say they're all the same all the time. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3503.32s)]
*  Jill Stein. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3504.32s)]
*  I'm not saying they are the same, but they're not different enough. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3505.32s)]
*  And if we want to see our project, and we've been proven absolutely right. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3507.2000000000003s)]
*  We've been proven absolutely right. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3512.0s)]
*  I think I was proven right. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3513.4s)]
*  We got Donald Trump. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3514.4s)]
*  The Democrats continue to give us Trump. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3515.4s)]
*  We can both be right. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3516.4s)]
*  Okay, we'll both be right, but people will suffer. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3517.4s)]
*  We can both be right. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3518.4s)]
*  Let's end on that note. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3519.4s)]
*  Jill Stein, Butch Ware, thank you so much for your time. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3520.4s)]
*  We do appreciate it. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3522.6800000000003s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIcZkqf9GRo&t=3523.6800000000003s)]
