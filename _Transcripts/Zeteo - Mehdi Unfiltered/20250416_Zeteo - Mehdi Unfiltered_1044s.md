Video Description: Donald Trump’s strongman act could drag the US into yet another Middle East war — this time, with Iran. Trump gave Iran two options: talk to us directly, or we will bomb you like never before. According to Trump, Iran went with the former. But how possible is a conflict with Tehran?

To break it all down, Iranian-American relations expert *Trita Parsi* joins *Mehdi Hasan* on ‘Mehdi Unfiltered.’

_“A lot of countries, including the Iranians, are discounting a lot of those threats, not in the sense that they don't take them seriously — they're preparing, but they understand that that's part of the noise that Trump seems to want to do.”_

Mehdi and Parsi discuss nuclear weapons, whether the desire for war is Trump’s or Netanyahu’s, Israel’s Gaza assault and its ever-expanding impact on Iranian allies (from Syria to Lebanon to Yemen), and how much weaker that leaves Iran in the face of a possible US/Israel-sponsored attack.

Watch the FULL interview to hear Mehdi *challenge* Parsi on whether it may have been too soon for him to suggest earlier this year that Trump was engaged in “peace efforts” in the Middle East.

# This is How Serious Trump is About Bombing Iran
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ)
*  US President Donald Trump, sorry, self-proclaimed anti-war President Donald Trump has recently [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=0.0s)]
*  said that if Iran doesn't come to an agreement on their nuclear program, he will bomb them. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=4.8s)]
*  And it won't just be any bombing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=9.42s)]
*  No, according to Trump, it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=10.76s)]
*  Indeed, the lives of countless Iranian civilians are now apparently hinged upon Trump's restraint [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=15.22s)]
*  or not during negotiations, which is a position no one really wants to be in. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  In addition to bombs, Trump threatened the Islamic Republic with secondary tariffs as [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  well and more sanctions. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=28.36s)]
*  All of this was triggered by Iran's rejection of holding direct talks with the US, instead [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=30.099999999999998s)]
*  saying that they're open to indirect diplomacy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=34.08s)]
*  Of course, one can't blame the Iranians for distrusting Trump since he was the one to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=36.56s)]
*  pull the US out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  The JCPOA that was signed with Iran back during the Obama days, he pulled out in 2018 and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  directed his administration to immediately begin the process of reimposing sanctions [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=49.08s)]
*  related to the JCPOA. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=52.84s)]
*  Throw in Israel's desire for an all-out war with Iran into the mix and you have a recipe [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=55.4s)]
*  for an even bigger crisis in the Middle East than the one taking place already. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  So what happens next? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  And was this what people expected from America's supposedly first anti-forever wars president? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=64.4s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss all of this and more is award-winning author and expert on [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=70.72s)]
*  US-Iran relations, Trita Parsi from the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=74.36s)]
*  Trita, welcome back to the show. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=78.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=80.12s)]
*  So a lot going on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=81.12s)]
*  Just to start with what he said on Meet the Press not too long ago. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=82.8s)]
*  How seriously should we take Trump's threat to bomb Iran in a major way? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=86.44s)]
*  I think we have to take it absolutely seriously. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=91.92s)]
*  Not because I think he actually wants to. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=94.96s)]
*  I do believe that he actually wants a deal. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=96.96s)]
*  But he may be trapping himself here in a position in which the Iranians are likely not going [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=99.24s)]
*  to respond positively to that type of bombastic demands. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=104.72s)]
*  We have a very clear history of evidence of that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=108.16s)]
*  And that he will then be left in a position in which he feels like he has to do something [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=111.74s)]
*  for his own credibility. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=115.14s)]
*  I do think that the biggest problem though right now in terms of getting to some sort [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=116.88s)]
*  of a deal is not him making these type of threats. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=122.72s)]
*  Those are not helpful. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=126.82s)]
*  I think that's highly problematic beyond the fact that he doesn't have authority from Congress. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=127.82s)]
*  He doesn't have any legal standing internationally. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=131.72s)]
*  No that seems to stop him on other issues. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=134.4s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't seem to care about that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=135.88s)]
*  I think the bigger problem right now actually is that he started off saying, look, I want [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=137.28s)]
*  to get a deal and my only red line is the nuclear program. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=142.16s)]
*  No nuclear weapon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=145.58s)]
*  That actually works because that's what the deal was in the past. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=147.1s)]
*  But then on February 4th he signed this memo that started talking about dismantling the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=150.76s)]
*  nuclear program, Libya style, ending all of Iran's relations with all of its different [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=155.88s)]
*  partners in the region from Hezbollah to the Houthis, as well as closing down Iran's missile [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=160.84s)]
*  program. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=165.2s)]
*  If that is the basis for talks, there's not going to be any talks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=166.38s)]
*  That's actually a bigger obstacle right now to getting somewhere than these bombastic [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=169.42s)]
*  threats because I think a lot of countries, including the Iranians, are discounting a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=173.54s)]
*  lot of those threats. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=178.62s)]
*  Not in the sense that they don't take them seriously, they're preparing, but they understand [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=179.7s)]
*  that that's part of the noise that Trump seems to want to do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=183.62s)]
*  But his actual negotiating position is more important. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=187.44s)]
*  If those are his positions, we're going to probably gravitate towards conflict. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  Dan Hodges of the Daily Mail in the UK published an article last week that claims he was told [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=194.78s)]
*  by senior political, military and diplomatic sources while he was in Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=198.5s)]
*  The United States and Israel are preparing to launch a strike on Iran that will finally [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=202.7s)]
*  eradicate the threat posed by the country's nuclear weapons program. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=206.18s)]
*  It doesn't have a nuclear weapons program as far as we know, but that's the Daily Mail. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=209.74s)]
*  Have you heard anything that confirms that America and Israel have already done the deal [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=212.54s)]
*  to bomb Iran? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=216.94s)]
*  No, I don't think that is the case. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=217.94s)]
*  I think there is a very intense debate going on inside the administration right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=219.26s)]
*  Those who are much more committed towards getting a deal and those who are pushing the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=224.82s)]
*  very same strategy that Bolton, Pompeo, Brian Hook put in place that was designed to make [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=229.42s)]
*  diplomacy fail so that war would be the only option. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=237.06s)]
*  That's what you have with this memo. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=241.24s)]
*  It's going for demands they know the Iranians are going to reject because they want the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=242.84s)]
*  rejection in order to go to war. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=246.42s)]
*  And you have others in the administration who are pushing for more realistic demands [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=248.3s)]
*  in order to get a deal. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=253.66s)]
*  So take a look at, for instance, what Witkoff said to Tucker Carlson in his interview. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=255.22s)]
*  He talked about a verification-based deal as well as that it would be very technical. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=260.96s)]
*  Any deal that is just going for the dismantlement of the program is not going to be particularly [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=268.02s)]
*  technical and it's not going to be particularly verification-based. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=272.5s)]
*  A verification-based that is very technical, you know what that sounds like? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=275.65999999999997s)]
*  A different version of the JCPOA, which means that what he's pushing for is a completely [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=278.7s)]
*  different approach, an approach that I think can work, but not again if they're going [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=284.42s)]
*  for these completely maximalist demands designed to fail. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=289.3s)]
*  So on that, you told the new Arab outlet in January that contrary to all the buzz that [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=292.46s)]
*  was spread by Hawks in Washington, Trump had no plan to return to maximum pressure but [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=296.53999999999996s)]
*  appears eager to start diplomacy with Iran and strike a deal. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=300.5s)]
*  Do you think that assessment is still true because he is doing maximum pressure right now? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=304.02s)]

*  Yeah, so this, it was true at the time because at the time you had an effort by the Hawks [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=324.46s)]
*  to try to give the impression that this was a done deal, that he's going to go for maximum [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  pressure and I think they were hoping to make sure that the Iranians would lash out and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=333.5s)]
*  make this a whole self-fulfilling prophecy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=337.54s)]
*  And as you may have noted, the person who was pushing for that maximum pressure strategy [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=339.78s)]
*  was fired on day one of the Trump administration. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=344.1s)]
*  But since Trump signed the memo on February 4th, and you may remember that press conference [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=347.9s)]
*  says, I really don't want to do this, but they're telling me that I have to. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=353.06s)]
*  So he kind of put it, but nevertheless, it had a tremendously negative effect. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=356.14s)]
*  I feel like a lot of people in diplomatic circles on the left, even on some parts of [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=360.26s)]
*  the kind of MAGA right, believed that Trump would somehow be less hawkish, less neoconservative, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=365.3s)]
*  less gung-ho than a Joe Biden or a Kamala Harris, would be less pro-Israel even. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=372.02000000000004s)]
*  And yet that was all wrong. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  In fact, in February, you wrote a piece headlined, Trump's peace efforts should be a wake-up [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=378.54s)]
*  call for Dems and that he's running circles around the left, you said. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=382.94s)]
*  This is the man who since that peace treaty has allowed Israel to violate the ceasefire, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=387.18s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinian children while he himself was bragging just the other day about [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=391.54s)]
*  bombing and killing hundreds of people in Yemen who may or may not have been Houthi [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=396.46000000000004s)]
*  fighters. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=400.26000000000005s)]
*  Do you feel a little bit naive, a little bit foolish to have put that Trump's peace efforts? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=401.74s)]
*  I went back and read it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=408.1s)]
*  I wonder how he feels now that you thought he was anti-war or pro-peace. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=409.1s)]
*  No, the full piece, if you see what I wrote there, is talking about the fact that he went [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=412.5s)]
*  and he was making statements such as peace is the most important element of my legacy. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=419.9s)]
*  You know, of course, of course. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  What did the Dems say? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=426.29999999999995s)]
*  What I was trying to point out in this piece is, and I say undeservingly or not, he's taking [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=427.29999999999995s)]
*  the space of claiming that he's the peace candidate. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=432.58s)]
*  Oh yeah, and he did that during the campaign, right? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=435.09999999999997s)]
*  Where has Kamala Harris goes around and says, no hold on, hold on, I want the most lethal [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=436.82s)]
*  military force in the world. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=441.55999999999995s)]
*  Don't use the word peace. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=443.14s)]
*  I went back and looked and the last time you actually had someone getting close to using [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=444.14s)]
*  that language was Obama saying, I don't want stupid words. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=447.94s)]
*  So we can agree on- [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=451.42s)]
*  But the point of that article is the Dems need to- [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=452.42s)]
*  Left the space for him. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=455.06s)]
*  And actually make sure that they're taking the space instead of leaving it empty for [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=456.38s)]
*  someone who may not at all deserve it and particularly mindful of what you're saying, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=460.46s)]
*  that's a strong case to be made. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=464.26s)]
*  But the space was left empty by the Dems. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=465.72s)]
*  So I half agree with you. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=467.54s)]
*  You're right, the space was left. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=468.54s)]
*  We don't disagree on that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  The criticism of Harris is totally legitimate. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=470.9s)]
*  And he did go to Michigan, remember, before the election and said, I'm going to be the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=473.12s)]
*  peace candidate. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=475.58s)]
*  Liz Cheney wants to drag Muslims into wars. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=476.74s)]
*  I'm going to be the anti-war guy. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=478.82s)]
*  All lies. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=480.14s)]
*  My problem is you can say the Democrats left the space without ever accepting the idea [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=482.02s)]
*  that he's some kind of peace guy or anti-war guy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=487.24s)]
*  When you say Trump's peace efforts, that implies there's some good faith to it, that they're [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=489.7s)]
*  real. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=493.86s)]
*  I mean, that ceasefire was fake from the get-go. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=494.86s)]
*  It was just for the inauguration. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=495.86s)]
*  He was never going to restrain Netanyahu. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=497.26s)]
*  We're talking to each other on a day that Netanyahu has been welcomed to DC with a red [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=498.9s)]
*  carpet. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=501.78s)]
*  He kind of did fool a lot of people who thought, oh, maybe he'll be less hawkish than Harris [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=503.41999999999996s)]
*  and Biden. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=508.34s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=509.34s)]
*  What is it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=510.34s)]
*  200 children killed in 24 hours? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=511.34s)]
*  I'm trying to remember exactly the article, but what I'm talking about there is what he [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=512.3399999999999s)]
*  was saying about Ukraine and other places. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=515.6s)]
*  And Gaza. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=517.78s)]
*  And Gaza as well. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=518.78s)]
*  Did you believe that was a real ceasefire in Gaza? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=519.78s)]
*  I believed. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=520.78s)]
*  Well, let me tell you one thing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=521.78s)]
*  It will be out in the news, but something happened when Wittgoff went to Israel. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=522.78s)]
*  And the reporting was that he said, I want to meet with Netanyahu. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=527.18s)]
*  They said no, because it's Shabbat and say, I don't care about Shabbat. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=530.22s)]
*  Well, something else happened there in which the US actually used a leverage that Biden [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=533.26s)]
*  was never willing to use to get the ceasefire. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=537.46s)]
*  But where's that leverage now? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=539.58s)]
*  The massacre of hundreds of Palestinians. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=541.22s)]
*  Now he's shifted back and I think is absolutely problematic. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=542.38s)]
*  However, at the time, pointing out that this is something a major shift. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=545.1800000000001s)]
*  But isn't this the problem with Trump, Trudeau? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=548.62s)]
*  You can't take him in the boat, but he's always going to shift. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  He's always going to let you down. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=552.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm not pinning my hope on Trump. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=554.58s)]
*  I'm pinning on the hope that perhaps there are forces within the administration that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=556.0600000000001s)]
*  ultimately will go in the right direction. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=559.9s)]
*  On Gaza right now, I think is absolutely problematic. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=561.98s)]
*  On Iran, I don't think I think the jury is out. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=564.42s)]
*  I think there's an opportunity. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=567.18s)]
*  And I think and I said this on your show. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=569.18s)]
*  I don't know if it was on the show, whether we were talking afterwards, that the difference [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=571.02s)]
*  between Netanyahu, sorry, between Biden, Harris and Trump would be that the gambit with Trump [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=575.22s)]
*  would be overwhelming. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=582.98s)]
*  It could go from full scale war to a deal. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=583.98s)]
*  Whereas if it would be Harris or Biden, it would be essentially the status quo. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=587.3000000000001s)]
*  The most unlikely outcomes would be war or a deal. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=592.1800000000001s)]
*  So you were in a situation right now and I said it on this show and I think it's still [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=595.66s)]
*  the same. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=598.5400000000001s)]
*  He could go in both directions. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  The risk of war right now is higher. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=600.5400000000001s)]
*  Risk of war is higher. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=602.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=603.46s)]
*  The opportunity for a deal is also way higher than it ever was under the Biden administration. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=604.46s)]
*  It's the status quo that is the least likely. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=608.9s)]
*  How much of this is driven by Israel's desire for an all out war with Iran? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=612.98s)]
*  After all, many in Israel, as well as Trump, claim Iran was behind October the 7th. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=617.0600000000001s)]
*  How much do you think that Netanyahu is in D.C. right now? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=622.34s)]
*  How much do you think that's driving all of this? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=626.08s)]
*  I find it very unlikely that there is any other force even close to that of Netanyahu [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=627.9s)]
*  driving this at this point, with the exception of some elements inside the administration [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=634.26s)]
*  who has essentially been on the same page as Netanyahu and Israel. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=638.38s)]
*  What about Gulf forces? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=641.4200000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=642.4200000000001s)]
*  This is a huge shift that has happened right now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=643.4200000000001s)]
*  Whether the Emiratis or the Saudis are anywhere close to pushing it in the same way that [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=645.66s)]
*  they were doing 10 years ago. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=650.3s)]
*  It's a very important differentiation here as well, in the sense that their focus has [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=651.9s)]
*  shifted elsewhere. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=655.9399999999999s)]
*  Israel is really alone as the one country that is pushing for this. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  And again, there are elements inside the U.S. government as well that is aligned with the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=660.78s)]
*  Israeli view. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=666.28s)]
*  What I think is also very important, and take a look at what Tucker Carlson tweeted today, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=667.78s)]
*  just about an hour ago, saying that I think the end line was, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=672.1s)]
*  any country that is pushing the United States into war with Iran is not a friend, it's an enemy. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=675.66s)]
*  You have very strong forces that Trump does listen to that recognize that this is a huge problem, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=680.94s)]
*  and they shouldn't go in that direction. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=686.74s)]
*  Trump himself tweeted a video, as you may recall, during the transition that accused [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=688.1s)]
*  Netanyahu rightfully of being one of the key forces behind the Iraq war. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=692.26s)]
*  But again, you can't put any stock in... [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=696.22s)]
*  He changes from day to day. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=698.46s)]
*  It doesn't matter what he tweeted. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=699.46s)]
*  It certainly does. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=700.46s)]
*  But this is the situation we're in right now. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=701.46s)]
*  What do you want to do? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=703.94s)]
*  Just go back and assume the worst all the time? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=704.94s)]
*  No, you've got to take advantage of whatever opportunities... [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=706.82s)]
*  But you should also assume that this man has any interest in peace or diplomacy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=708.6600000000001s)]
*  And I don't think I've made any assumptions that everything is going to work out fine. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=711.34s)]
*  Because I watch him bombing Yemen. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=714.9000000000001s)]
*  He's killed more people in Yemen in his first three months than Biden killed in all of 2024, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=718.0600000000001s)]
*  according to stats. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=723.34s)]
*  That kind of stuff is shocking. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=724.34s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=726.74s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=727.74s)]
*  I don't know if it's true, but there is some reporting saying that he's even considered [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=729.62s)]
*  ground troops. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=734.22s)]
*  That is exactly what many of the restrainers have warned about, which is you start off [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=735.46s)]
*  with something that, first of all, has nothing to do with US interests. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=740.14s)]
*  And you saw from some of the signal groups, those were also arguments that was used there. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=743.14s)]
*  But then they went down this path. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=749.0600000000001s)]
*  And if they continue on this path, they may actually get trapped, trapping themselves [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=750.38s)]
*  into something that brings ground forces into Yemen. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=754.22s)]
*  Just explain as the expert on this issue, explain to our viewers one important point [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=757.32s)]
*  that often gets lost in all of this. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  Whether Iran has a nuclear weapon or not, and everyone agrees, everyone seriously agrees [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=763.32s)]
*  they don't, whether they're trying to get one or not, which is a great divide for the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=767.24s)]
*  last 20 years, there is no military solution to this, is there? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=770.24s)]
*  When people talk about going in and bombing the nuclear program, what does that actually [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=774.08s)]
*  mean? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  Because can't they just reconstitute it straight after? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=779.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, wouldn't they be more likely after being bombed to start a nuclear weapons program? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=781.44s)]
*  And here I think the Israelis are actually kind of frank about it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=785.92s)]
*  They never said that there is a military one-time solution. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=788.96s)]
*  They've all along said that it would entail repeated attacks over the course of years. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=792.28s)]
*  Mowing the lawn in Iran, like Gaza. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=797.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=798.48s)]
*  I mean, mowing the entire region at this point. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=799.48s)]
*  Look what they're doing in Syria as well. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=801.32s)]
*  So there's never really been that type of a military solution. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=803.1s)]
*  And there isn't a military program. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=806.38s)]
*  And again, just look at what the Trump administration's own threat assessment said that came out, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=807.96s)]
*  was it two weeks or so ago, repeated what has been said before. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=812.4s)]
*  There is no active military program. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=815.64s)]
*  But if there were to be bombed, that might kick one off. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=817.6s)]
*  Well, not only that. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=820.1999999999999s)]
*  What we have seen over the course of the last two years, because of Gaza, because of the [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=821.36s)]
*  fact that one of the main miscalculations the Iranians did is that they believed, they [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=827.3199999999999s)]
*  never believed the United States would go in so full out in favor of Israel and take [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=832.68s)]
*  away all of the restraints on Israel. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=837.88s)]
*  Biden did that already. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=840.72s)]
*  Trump is continuing. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=842.2s)]
*  Perhaps he's taken off even more restraints. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=843.2s)]
*  That was a major miscalculation from their end. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=845.48s)]
*  And all of that has really changed the debate inside of Iran. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=848.24s)]
*  You have far more voices now inside of Iran saying, actually, don't negotiate. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=850.9200000000001s)]
*  You have to build a bomb. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=855.88s)]
*  But on that basis, one of the big questions about Iran is how strong or weak is Iran right [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=857.32s)]
*  now militarily? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=861.98s)]
*  Because the argument in the past from restrainers in the West, from anti-war voices were not [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=863.36s)]
*  just if you bomb Iran, it's more likely to lead to a nuclear weapon, but also it will [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=868.12s)]
*  kick off World War III. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=872.08s)]
*  It will kick off a conflagration in the region we've never seen before. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=873.52s)]
*  Iran will respond with Hezbollah, with Houthis, with Hamas, with Assad. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=876.84s)]
*  Assad's gone. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=881.84s)]
*  Hamas has its own issues in Gaza. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=882.84s)]
*  Hezbollah's lost its leader. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=885.04s)]
*  Houthis are being bombed right now. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=886.56s)]
*  Is Iran in a uniquely weak position? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=888.42s)]
*  Because a lot of people are arguing in Israel. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=889.88s)]
*  Now's the time to strike. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=891.68s)]
*  Iran's weak. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=892.68s)]
*  What do you say to that argument? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=893.68s)]
*  So that's the part of the Israeli argument that they're making to the White House right [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=894.68s)]
*  now saying the Iranians are, as you said, uniquely weak and as a result- [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=897.6999999999999s)]
*  And is it true, is what I'm wondering? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=901.64s)]
*  I don't think it is true. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=902.84s)]
*  I think the Iranians, without a doubt, are in a weaker position regionally, as you pointed [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=903.84s)]
*  out, what's happening with Hezbollah, and more importantly, Syria. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=908.4s)]
*  Hamas was never part of the larger deterrence that the Iranians had built. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=912.96s)]
*  Not even were the Houthis. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=919.7800000000001s)]
*  The Houthis have now become much more important because of the loss of Syria and Hezbollah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=920.7800000000001s)]
*  But on the nuclear front, they are way ahead than they were in 2015. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=924.98s)]
*  They're way ahead when Trump first came into office back in 2016. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=929.92s)]
*  In fact, they're way ahead because Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=934.0s)]
*  So now they have 60 percent, they have a far larger stockpile. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=937.36s)]
*  So yes, they have lost some assets in the region. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=940.66s)]
*  Without a doubt, regionally they're much weaker. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=943.42s)]
*  On the nuclear front, they have much more leverage than they did before. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=946.06s)]
*  And we do not yet know exactly what their own military strength is in terms of could [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=949.5799999999999s)]
*  they still create a tremendous amount of dangers. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=955.12s)]
*  I would suspect that they can. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=957.8199999999999s)]
*  And I say this based on the fact that at the end of the day, despite the fact that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=959.46s)]
*  many of their throwing missiles at Israel was much for show, but the second attack in [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=962.84s)]
*  October, you had a very large number of their missiles penetrating all layers of Israel's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=968.96s)]
*  air defenses to the point that the Israelis asked for two THAAD battery systems, which [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=975.58s)]
*  is the most advanced anti-missile missile system that exists in the world. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=980.24s)]
*  They wouldn't have done that if the Iranians were not successful. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=986.08s)]
*  And that was targeting Israel, which is a very relatively small piece of territory. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=989.34s)]
*  If they were to use that against a large number of bases throughout the region, et cetera, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=994.22s)]
*  I suspect that given what they've demonstrated, they're still actually very capable not to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=998.62s)]
*  have this capacity of projecting force offensively, but in terms of being attacked and inflicting [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=1004.1s)]
*  significant damage, I think it would be a huge mistake, huge mistake to discount that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=1010.14s)]
*  just because Hezbollah already lost the mass. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=1014.98s)]
*  We can only hope that the restraining voices you say in the administration win that battle. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=1018.86s)]
*  Trita Parsi from the Quincy Institute, thank you so much for your time. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=1024.1s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7DdshIAQQQ&t=1026.42s)]
