Video Description: Author and historian William Dalrymple joins Mehdi on this week’s episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered,’ to discuss his latest book, ‘The Golden Road: How Ancient India Transformed the World.’ The book makes the case that, for over a millennia, India was an international powerhouse that shaped civilizations around it – it was ‘the heart of ancient Eurasia’ – and that its advances and influence have been erased. 

The two also discuss Israel’s war in Gaza and why William has been so outspoken while other authors and historians have remained silent. “I have the freedom to speak out,” he tells Mehdi Hasan. “If, as an author, you know something to be untrue and you know a great injustice is going on, it's your duty to do this.”

# Palestinians' 'Great Injustice': Historian William Dalrymple on Having Freedom to Speak Out
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw)
*  A new book is making the case that for centuries, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=0.0s)]
*  India was a powerhouse that shaped the civilizations around it. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=2.64s)]
*  In fact, from approximately 250 BCE to 1200 CE, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=5.96s)]
*  India exported a rich array of ideas from astronomy to art, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  from religion to philosophy, and created a vast Indusphere. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=13.84s)]
*  As the book shows, our understanding of the world today [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=17.88s)]
*  would not be the same without India's groundbreaking [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=20.04s)]
*  contributions to mathematics, introducing concepts [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=23.56s)]
*  like the number zero and the decimal system. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=26.32s)]
*  The Golden Road, How Ancient India Transformed the World, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=29.16s)]
*  is the latest from British author and historian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=32.24s)]
*  William Dalrymple, who has written more than a dozen books, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=34.68s)]
*  including The Anarchy, which looked at colonialism [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=37.4s)]
*  and private profit through the prism of the East India Company. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=39.8s)]
*  Dalrymple is also the co-host of Empire, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=43.72s)]
*  one of the most popular historical podcasts [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  in the world today, a BAFTA winner, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=48.36s)]
*  and was named one of the world's top 50 thinkers [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  by Prospect Magazine. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=52.72s)]
*  He's also spent the last year trying to educate people [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=54.44s)]
*  about the history of Palestine and speaking out about the horror [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=57.04s)]
*  of Israel's genocidal assault on Gaza, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=60.48s)]
*  and William Dalrymple joins me. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=63.2s)]
*  I believe from Scotland, where you're promoting the book, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=64.88s)]
*  Will... [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=67.4s)]
*  I'm in a bed and breakfast in Wicton, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=68.4s)]
*  which, if you didn't know already, is Scotland's book town. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=71.2s)]
*  It's the... It's the kind of hey-oh-why of... [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=74.12s)]
*  I think all of our subscribers know Wicton. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=76.84s)]
*  I think they knew instantly the moment you said it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=79.28s)]
*  We will come to the book in a moment, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=81.8s)]
*  and congratulations on yet another successful new book. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=83.68s)]
*  And I know it's out in the US in April, it's already out in the UK, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=86.76s)]
*  but let's start, please, with the ongoing horror show in Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=90.0s)]
*  Will, why have you chosen to be so outspoken [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=94.88s)]
*  about what's happening in the Middle East, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=98.4s)]
*  what Israel is doing, when other historians, other authors [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=100.72s)]
*  have stayed relatively quiet? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=104.08s)]
*  And what... And also, what do you make of how bad the situation is there [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=106.08s)]
*  compared to other conflicts you've covered, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=110.28s)]
*  both historically and in the current day and age? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=112.72s)]
*  I think the simple thing with this conflict [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=116.88s)]
*  is that anyone who has spent time with Palestinians in Palestine... [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=118.88s)]
*  I've never been to Gaza, but I spent months on the West Bank... [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=123.44s)]
*  cannot unsee what you see there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=128.24s)]
*  Once you see Palestinians in this incredibly beautiful [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=130.32s)]
*  Tuscan-like landscape with olive groves and villages [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=135.28s)]
*  and this extraordinary beautiful life that they led in this part of the world, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=139.6s)]
*  to see the settlers encroaching on it, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=144.24s)]
*  the very blatant apartheid, the two road systems, the two passport systems, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=146.4s)]
*  the different colours of the number plates for one people and the other, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  and the different rights that they enjoy with one people [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=155.44s)]
*  under summary military law and the other enjoying all the rights of a democracy. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=158.24s)]
*  You can't unsee it, and anyone that's been there and seen that [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=163.52s)]
*  speaks out loud. I mean, I don't know anyone that's seen it and kept quiet. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=168.24s)]
*  The trouble is there's so little... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  There's so few people that have gone there and seen it, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=174.24s)]
*  and so many who, in a sense, see only Tel Aviv or the Israeli part of the world. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  I should say straight up a firm believer in a two-state solution. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=184.88s)]
*  I do think that Israel has to be allowed to exist, but alongside Palestine. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  And I think the two states side by side is the obvious solution to this problem. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  But putting aside... [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=198.56s)]
*  The one that is attainable. If only American politicians were to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  put the pressure that they can put on to follow what is clearly international law [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=202.64s)]
*  and everything that the United Nations has laid down for 75 years. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  If only America would put pressure on. But just, I mean, look, the two-state solution [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=212.55999999999997s)]
*  is something that's been debated, discussed for decades on, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  and whether it even can exist, let's see. But on Gaza itself, you have been very critical. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=218.16s)]
*  I look at your Twitter feed, I see what you're saying in interviews, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  and I just wonder, you know, you've got a new book out. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=228.0s)]
*  A lot of people tell me they worry about losing book deals, losing agents, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=231.04s)]
*  losing podcast shows if they come out too strongly against Israel, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=234.96s)]
*  especially post-October the 7th. You don't feel that way? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=239.04s)]
*  I don't have a job. I don't have a university position. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=242.48s)]
*  I have the freedom to speak out. And if as an author you know something to be untrue [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=248.0s)]
*  and you know a great injustice is going on, it's your duty to do this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  I have to say, I felt, I mean, it's very, very important to get your facts right. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  It's very, very important that you make it completely clear that you haven't got [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=263.04s)]
*  an anti-Semitic bone in your body and you're motivated for humanitarian reasons. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=267.36s)]
*  But if you know your facts and know your history, and I spent years writing about this region, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=271.68s)]
*  I've written particularly a book on the Christians in the Middle East called From the Holy Mountain. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  If you do know your stuff and say your truth clearly, you can say it, certainly in Britain. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=280.32000000000005s)]
*  Let me read something you wrote for The Guardian. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=285.84s)]
*  The foreign pages of the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs have contained a notable absence [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=288.96s)]
*  of clear critical reporting of Israel's deadly methods of suppressing Palestinian descent. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=293.76s)]
*  Will, you wrote this all the way back in 2002. Do you still feel this rings true today? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=298.4s)]
*  I've been saying this for a while. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=303.68s)]
*  And I'm wondering in terms of media coverage and the lack of Palestinian voices in the British [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=305.12s)]
*  media as well as the American media, do you think it's even worse today than it was 22 years ago [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=308.64s)]
*  when you wrote that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=312.24s)]
*  Well, I think it's more polarised than it was 22 years ago. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=313.68s)]
*  In Britain, we now have a large indigenous, if you like, Muslim community who are voters, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=317.76s)]
*  who go to our universities and can have heard the other side of the story and are speaking [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=325.12s)]
*  clearly and articulately. On the other hand, the British right wing has got much more extreme [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=331.36s)]
*  about this. When I started off writing about this 30 years ago or even 40 years ago, actually, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=336.32s)]
*  there were still a lot more sympathetic voices of, if you like, British Arabists on the right [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=342.24s)]
*  who knew the region well. But I think there's far fewer people that seem to know that region [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=348.48s)]
*  and figures like, for example, Rory Stewart, who spent a lot of time in the region and have [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=353.6s)]
*  a prominent voice, a few and far between. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=358.24s)]
*  Alan Duncan as well. Back in February... [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=360.16s)]
*  Yeah, Alan Duncan, been a good case, exactly. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=362.24s)]
*  Back in February, you tweeted about Israel's actions in Gaza writing, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=364.16s)]
*  quote, I would advocate a version of what worked for the British in Northern Ireland, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=367.44s)]
*  sending the special forces after the implacable terrorists while working on a political track [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=371.28s)]
*  to make them irrelevant. Can you elaborate on that for our audience who don't quite know that analogy? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=376.4s)]
*  So the British had a problem, a very large problem called the Troubles in Northern Ireland. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=382.4s)]
*  Northern Ireland was the area of Ireland that was sectioned off in the early part of the 20th century [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=390.88s)]
*  for the Protestant minority. In the 1970s, there was a wave of pub bombings throughout Britain and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=396.96s)]
*  other such actions aimed at innocent civilians when large numbers of civilians were killed in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=405.12s)]
*  what we would call terrorist atrocities. The response to the British was not to carpet bomb [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Catholic Belfast or to herd people around with [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=417.6s)]
*  orders to move out of their homes from place to place for a year. They did not starve them to death, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  they did not turn off the water and the electricity, they did not ban foreign journalists from covering [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=431.6s)]
*  that area. Instead, in the end, a political process was worked out and a political solution [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=437.52s)]
*  was found which, while far from perfect, has kept the peace and there are no more pub bombings. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=444.0s)]
*  There's very little violence in Northern Ireland now and a political solution has been found to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=449.84s)]
*  that problem. Any government faced with acts of terrorism, I suppose, must show some element of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=455.6s)]
*  force in response to them, but the only long-term solution to a political problem is a political [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=466.56s)]
*  solution. What would you say to...? For the British, we haven't had bombs in our pubs [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=473.04s)]
*  for 30 years now. And it was obviously a British right-wing government, Margaret Thatcher and then [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=478.16s)]
*  John Major, which led the way in that political solution. But ultimately, Tony Blair and Jonathan [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  Powell who made the final... But it's interesting that even Thatcher was willing to talk to terrorists, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  quote unquote, which we're told not to do. Shin Fain was the political... Incidentally, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=491.44s)]
*  we should say that the terrorists, if you want to use that word for the IRA, got most of their [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=495.44s)]
*  funding from fundraising in New York and Washington. Very good point. And Boston. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=501.44s)]
*  Very, very good point. Another element to the... Let me ask you this. What would you say to people [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=507.36s)]
*  in Israel who say you cannot compare IRA, Shin Fain, the political wing of the IRA, to Hamas? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=512.32s)]
*  There is no political wing of Hamas that we can negotiate with. What's your response to people [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=519.76s)]
*  who say that? I would say that there are direct parallels between the conflict and I would compare [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=523.6s)]
*  Hamas to the, if you like, the real IRA, the most extreme elements. But what was fascinating is once [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=529.36s)]
*  you got a political solution and the grievances, the very real grievances of Catholics in Northern [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  Ireland were sorted, the real IRA and the ultra-violent extremists just faded away [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=542.72s)]
*  because most ordinary people just want to live in peace. So Northern Ireland is a fantastically [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=549.28s)]
*  good example of how you can solve what appeared to be a half century of completely intractable [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=553.52s)]
*  problems leading to violence and the growth of militant groups in every direction [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=563.36s)]
*  that disappeared like the dawn in the midday. Once the sun of the political solution was [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=570.96s)]
*  beaming down, the violence just disappeared from sight. So there is a very concrete example of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=578.48s)]
*  something that people said was intractable that Irish Catholics and Protestants can never live [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=586.64s)]
*  together. They're doing so very successfully now. There are hiccups, there are difficult moments, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=590.64s)]
*  but it is an absolutely poster solution of a sort that could be achieved in Palestine. There are [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=596.0s)]
*  hundreds of Palestinians and Israelis who are very happy living side by side, who do [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=603.84s)]
*  live together in various different ways, and it's not impossible for this to happen. And there are [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=608.64s)]
*  many, many very, very fine Israelis who are working for peace along very fine Palestinians. So I'm not [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=614.0s)]
*  ultimately pessimistic about this. This is something that can be achieved, but it does need will from [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=620.96s)]
*  America and it needs people to be educated. The biggest problem in the Middle East is ignorance. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=627.52s)]
*  And ignorance of the history. On the issue of education, as a historian, what other examples, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=633.84s)]
*  are there any other obvious examples from history that you've covered that American, Israeli, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=640.0s)]
*  Arab, Palestinian policymakers can look to for inspiration or guidance? When you talk about [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=647.76s)]
*  achieving a ceasefire, negotiating with your enemies, what does history tell you about the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=653.84s)]
*  best way to end what's happening in Gaza right now? Well, I would say Northern Ireland is the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=658.32s)]
*  best example of something which was resulting in a similar polarization of militant groups [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=663.12s)]
*  and the political and political wings. And you can work with the political wings. I mean, there is [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=669.92s)]
*  the Oslo Accords. It was all there. And what fell apart was this sort of strange [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  alliance on one hand of Hamas letting off bus bombs after the death of Rabin, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=682.64s)]
*  and then Netanyahu coming into power and keeping that cycle going. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=689.36s)]
*  There are in both conflicts militants and in both conflicts there are Democrats and peacemakers [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=695.28s)]
*  who can make peace with each other. I mean, there are many potential Rabins in Israel. Obviously, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=701.36s)]
*  at the moment, we're in a situation where there's extreme polarization. There's been [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=707.44s)]
*  violence on both sides. There are people who are whipped up into a frenzy of hatred on both sides [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=711.28s)]
*  of the divide. And it's going to be very difficult at the moment to bring them back together. But [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=719.3599999999999s)]
*  across both communities, there are people prepared to stand up for peace and work for peace. And so [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=725.92s)]
*  I do think it's not impossible. Obviously, at the moment, it is an extremely dark moment in this [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=730.24s)]
*  conflict. Let's switch gears, talk about your new book. What was the most surprising discovery [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=736.32s)]
*  you made as a historian of India during your research for the Golden Road? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=742.08s)]
*  Well, it's not an amazing discovery. And all sorts of people have known about the importance of [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  India. And Indians are well aware of it. In a sense, I don't know whether viewers in the United [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=753.2s)]
*  States or abroad will know the Goodness Gracious Me sketch on the British TV show where Sanjeev [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=758.88s)]
*  Bhaskar is the proud Indian uncle claiming Leonardo da Vinci Indian, everything's Indian, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=765.36s)]
*  Indian, everything's Indian, shampoo, Indian, and so on. And so the Sanjeev Bhaskar sketch [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=770.48s)]
*  illustrates, I think, the frustration that many Indians feel that they know that they created Zero. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=777.52s)]
*  They know the huge contributions of Indian civilization to world civilization. But very [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=782.64s)]
*  few people outside the Indian diaspora and Indians know about this. And one of the things I've tried [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=789.44s)]
*  to do in this book is to make a kind of rational case for the importance of India. There are all [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=795.7600000000001s)]
*  sorts of people who will tell you that, you know, Indians invented the atomic bombs during the great [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=800.24s)]
*  battles of the Mahabharata or roved around in space shuttles or did plastic surgery or whatever. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=805.44s)]
*  But the truth is extraordinary enough without having to make anything up. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=813.2s)]
*  The three areas I look at in this book are the story of the spread of Buddhism, particularly [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=817.76s)]
*  in a sense the little understood way that an Indian religion, Buddhism, because the Buddha [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=823.8399999999999s)]
*  lived in by the banks of the Ganges in what's now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in northern India, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=831.28s)]
*  how his message of an end to suffering took over China and reached its peak in the mid-7th century [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=836.9599999999999s)]
*  when an empress called Wood Zetian made Buddhism and Indian religion the state religion. And when [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=846.32s)]
*  she basically performed a sort of Mahayana Buddhist kudatta, bringing in monks trained in [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=856.0s)]
*  the Indian University of Nalanda and having them run the administration. So that's one story. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=861.2s)]
*  There's another story about how Hinduism went to Southeast Asia along with the Sanskrit language [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=866.24s)]
*  and Sanskrit literature ending up in the largest Hindu temple in the world being built in Angkor [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=872.72s)]
*  Wat, not in India. It's a Vishnu temple originally. And finally the story of Indian mathematics that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=878.48s)]
*  the numbers we all use every day, the nine Indian numerals plus zero, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=885.36s)]
*  spread from India to the Arab world and from the Arab world through Fibonacci. The great [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=892.48s)]
*  mathematician brought them to Italy as late as the 12th century and up to that point everyone [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=899.04s)]
*  was scrabbling around with Roman numerals trying to multiply xxxvmcm times xvmcmvv. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=903.28s)]
*  Thank God we don't have to do that now. Thank God. You mentioned people not knowing in the US or UK. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=913.92s)]
*  Education systems in the West, well they give the impression that most of the scientific advances [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=919.4399999999999s)]
*  of antiquity were the product of the brilliance of ancient Greece and ancient Rome. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=924.72s)]
*  We learn about Pythagoras, Archimedes, but really nobody knows about mathematicians like Brahmagupta, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=929.28s)]
*  the seventh century Indian mathematician and philosopher that you write about in The Golden [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  Road. Why do you think they've been erased? Is this just a consequence of colonialism? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=939.2s)]
*  Is this Eurocentrism? Is it racism? Is it ignorance? Is it all of the above? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=944.32s)]
*  It's all of the above. Anyone that knows their colonial history will know the famous minute [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=949.84s)]
*  the British educator Macaulay who wrote that a single shelf of a good English library is worth [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=955.12s)]
*  the entire native literature of India and Arabia. And we laugh at that prejudice today, but it sort [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=960.88s)]
*  of echoes continuing our education system. As you say, we learned about Archimedes and Pythagoras [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=967.04s)]
*  probably before our seventh birthday, but Brahmagupta and Ariabatta, who between them produced the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=972.4s)]
*  numeral system we all use every day and zero. And Ariabatta calculates the circumference of the [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=979.04s)]
*  earth, the distance to the moon, a version of pi. These sort of things are known in India very [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=986.4s)]
*  early on, and yet we've never heard his name. And the numeral system we used is called the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=994.0s)]
*  Arabic numeral system, which is indeed where Europeans got it from, but it's not where it started. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=999.04s)]
*  One last question. How worried are you about India's future right now under the Modi-led, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1003.6s)]
*  BJP-led, very Hindu nationalist government, especially in the field of academia, research, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1009.12s)]
*  history, which have become super politicized areas in India right now, haven't they? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1015.12s)]
*  Well, India is a democracy, and there was an election two months ago when Mr Modi's majority [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1021.76s)]
*  was greatly reduced. And I think there is a sense now that there's much greater freedom to talk [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1028.96s)]
*  and express contrary views. It is in fact a poster case for how democracy can change things. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1034.0s)]
*  I and many others have always spoken out what we thought very clearly about history. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1043.04s)]
*  This book is an example of an area which in many ways was held up as an area praised by [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1051.36s)]
*  the extreme right. This book is an attempt to, in a sense, rationalize some of the slightly [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1058.88s)]
*  madcap claims about it and create something that is factual, is based in sound fact, and in a sense, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1065.44s)]
*  not to let the far right appropriated area of history and dominate it. This is something that [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1072.96s)]
*  all Indians, it's their heritage, and it should be known by the wider world. It's an important part [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1079.3600000000001s)]
*  of world civilization. It's a great book. Congratulations. The book is called The Golden [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  Road, How Ancient India Transformed the World. William Darrow, thank you so much for your time. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVKER7L5wxw&t=1088.48s)]
