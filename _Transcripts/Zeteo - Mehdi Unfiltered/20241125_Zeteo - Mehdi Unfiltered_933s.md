# Trump’s Purpose? 'Definitely' To Get Revenge on His Enemies
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4)
*  The White House will have its old splash of orange back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=0.0s)]
*  as Donald Trump is set to make his grand return [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=3.2s)]
*  to its hallways and corridors on January the 20th. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=5.4s)]
*  In the meantime, the world is watching with bated breath [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=9.0s)]
*  as he starts to staff his administration with one hawk [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=11.4s)]
*  after another, Marco Rubio, Elise Stefanik, Mike Schwartz, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=14.0s)]
*  Mike Huckabee. The list goes on. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=17.6s)]
*  Trump's second term in office, I suspect, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=20.12s)]
*  will be much worse than his first term. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=22.2s)]
*  But how much worse? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=24.12s)]
*  How much will Trump turn this into a campaign of vengeance? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Who better to ask than someone who not only wrote the book [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=29.8s)]
*  on the Trumps, but is a Trump himself? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=32.2s)]
*  Fred Trump III is the nephew of Donald Trump [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  and the author of All In the Family, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=37.2s)]
*  The Trumps and How We Got This Way, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=38.800000000000004s)]
*  which takes a deep dive into the inner workings [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  of the Trump family and won Trump's quest [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  to differentiate himself from the rest. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=45.2s)]
*  Fred, thank you so much for joining Me, the Unfilled. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=47.6s)]
*  Appreciate you taking time out. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=49.8s)]
*  Your uncle, Donald J. Trump, is set to become [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=51.8s)]
*  the next president of the United States again. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=54.8s)]
*  What was your own initial reaction on election night [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=57.4s)]
*  to the news, the clear news, that he was running away with this? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Surprised. I had said for months that I thought it would be [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=66.2s)]
*  as close as the pollsters have said [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=70.2s)]
*  and many of us pundits have said. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=73.0s)]
*  I was kind of surprised. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=77.2s)]
*  I was down in D.C. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=79.2s)]
*  and I had an interview with a British television network [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=82.4s)]
*  and by the time I got back to the hotel, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=86.6s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, having witnessed many, many campaigns [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=88.8s)]
*  in the past, decades of them, said, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=93.0s)]
*  wow, it's not going that way. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  Donald's going to win this thing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  Yes, and he has won this thing and he's heading back to power. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  Before we get into what's coming next, just a bit of background. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  You and your sister, Mary Trump, who we've had on this show before, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=104.8s)]
*  you've both written books on the Trumps [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=109.0s)]
*  in an attempt to differentiate yourselves from the rest of the pack. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=111.6s)]
*  What was it in your upbringing, do you think, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=115.0s)]
*  that made you different to Eric Trump or Donald Jr., dare I ask? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=118.2s)]
*  Well, just to, first of all, to differentiate myself [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=125.8s)]
*  from my sister's book, I know Donald. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=128.6s)]
*  I've known him so well over the years, decades, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=131.2s)]
*  during his formative years and business career [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=135.4s)]
*  and his political career. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=140.0s)]
*  My sister, as I've said, maybe has spoken five words to him [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  in the past 30 years. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  So that's where it's different from me. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=147.2s)]
*  Eric and I, and even Donnie, had a really decent relationship [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  over the years. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=154.4s)]
*  They're much younger than me, but that's fine. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=155.2s)]
*  I still regret that Ivanka and I did not have a good relationship [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=158.4s)]
*  because I think we could, we both, I think, feel important [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=163.0s)]
*  about community and what we can do to help other people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=169.6s)]
*  I think that could be, you know, a thing of the past. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=174.20000000000002s)]
*  And people will ask me, is there a chance that you can reconcile [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  with any of them? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=182.6s)]
*  My guess is it could be with Donald, if anything. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=184.6s)]
*  And my advocacy on behalf of people with intellectual [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=187.8s)]
*  and developmental disabilities, like my son William, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=192.6s)]
*  Donald's grandnephew, you know, maybe this is the opportunity [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=196.0s)]
*  for him that he didn't really take a bite out of the first time [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  around. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=203.8s)]
*  This could be his opportunity to allow me to work on behalf [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=204.20000000000002s)]
*  of people, a very large population, 60, 70 million people [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=209.4s)]
*  in this country, to help them give voice. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=214.20000000000002s)]
*  And I'll come to that in just a moment. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  Just on the book, though, are you saying, having written this book, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=219.0s)]
*  you haven't fallen out with the Trump, the rest of the Trump family? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=222.0s)]
*  You mean they haven't kind of disowned you? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=224.9s)]
*  Oh, I'm not saying that at all. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, my son's Williams fund that was put together [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=228.9s)]
*  by Donald and his siblings, which again, if people will read [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=235.70000000000002s)]
*  my book and or listen to my book will understand that was money [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=240.5s)]
*  that was taken from me by Donald back in the early 2000s, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=244.3s)]
*  when he orchestrated a plan to take my sister and me out [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=250.3s)]
*  of father's will. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=254.1s)]
*  Okay, that happened. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=255.1s)]
*  We need to move forward as a country. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=257.2s)]
*  Donald is the president now or will be the president in a couple [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=259.0s)]
*  of months. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=262.5s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=262.9s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=264.4s)]
*  I don't like the policies of the the Republican Party. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=266.0s)]
*  I never have the Republican Party is morphed into something [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=270.0s)]
*  I could never imagine. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=274.4s)]
*  I don't think many of your viewers could imagine but we need [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=276.1s)]
*  to work together and and write the country if possible and I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=280.3s)]
*  will do everything we can to do that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=285.7s)]
*  So I'm going to come back to that point very interesting point [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=287.5s)]
*  about writing the country, but let's just talk about disability [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=289.7s)]
*  rights and your son you write in your book that the motivation [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  for the book came from an interaction you had with Donald Trump [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=295.2s)]
*  when he was in the Oval Office. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=298.3s)]
*  What was that conversation? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  What did Trump say to share that with our viewers? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, when when Donald was elected president and he was inaugurated [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=304.0s)]
*  my wife Lisa reached out to Ivanka my cousin and asked if we [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=310.4s)]
*  could meet with some cabinet secretaries about you know advocacy [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=315.8s)]
*  on behalf of people with complex disabilities, which my son [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=322.0s)]
*  William has and Ivanka was great. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=325.7s)]
*  We met with Ben Carson that we met with Alex Azar and over three [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=328.5s)]
*  years we had some very important conversations with a group that [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=332.5s)]
*  Lisa and I have aligned ourselves with called equally alive. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=337.9s)]
*  But in May of 2020 we were all together in the Oval Office with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=341.7s)]
*  Alex Azar and Brett Giroir and several other governmental officials [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=347.7s)]
*  and when the meeting ended and we weren't just saying just throw [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=353.3s)]
*  a couple of billion dollars at this problem. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=357.4s)]
*  We knew that we could try to make our cause more efficient and get [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=359.6s)]
*  better services again for this incredibly large population of Americans [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=365.9s)]
*  and what Donald said to me when he called me back into the office [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=372.7s)]
*  these people meaning the disabled the cost they should just die. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=376.9s)]
*  Wow, that's what he said and there was a witness there for that [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=384.6s)]
*  and I'm not happy to repeat that and I want to get past that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=389.1s)]
*  What was your reaction in the moment? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=394.20000000000005s)]
*  This is your uncle. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=395.6s)]
*  This is your uncle. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=396.70000000000005s)]
*  This is not just a president. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=397.3s)]
*  This is not just a man who's hated by half the country. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=398.20000000000005s)]
*  This is your uncle saying this to you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=400.20000000000005s)]
*  What was your reaction in that moment? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=401.70000000000005s)]
*  I was just happy that the people that I had brought down with me [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=404.6s)]
*  equally alive. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=408.20000000000005s)]
*  They were not in the office to hear this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=409.0s)]
*  It was devastating for me to hear that and then yes three years [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=412.1s)]
*  later when he said the same thing, but pointedly about my son, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=415.8s)]
*  his grandnephew. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=420.8s)]
*  What did he say then? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=422.0s)]
*  We were talking about William on the telephone and he said William [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=425.8s)]
*  doesn't recognize you. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=429.2s)]
*  He should just die and move to Florida being me and my wife moved [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=430.90000000000003s)]

*  William Donald had never met William. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=440.2s)]
*  I said no, he does recognize me. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=442.1s)]
*  But again, I do want to talk about moving forward, but I got to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=444.7s)]
*  do it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=449.2s)]
*  I got to deal with I got to deal with this specific point here [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=449.5s)]
*  because I'm someone who's very critical of the president-elect [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=451.5s)]
*  and I've called him a sociopath in the past and people think it's [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  just verbal abuse. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=457.7s)]

*  That is not a normal thing that normal people say to anyone let [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=474.0s)]
*  alone their nephew. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=478.0s)]
*  There's something wrong with the man is there not? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=479.5s)]
*  I can't imagine any human being say that about anyone else, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=483.59999999999997s)]

*  I guess my point is and I don't know what it is in my character. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=494.0s)]
*  I guess I got it from my mother and my father. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=497.5s)]

*  backstory that suggests he'll be any better next time. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=528.6s)]
*  In fact, let me ask you as someone who knows him you say Mary [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_EIP3U3jI4&t=530.8000000000001s)]
