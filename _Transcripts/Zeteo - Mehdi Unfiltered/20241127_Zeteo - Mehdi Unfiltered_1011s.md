# Warfare in Gaza is on a ‘Different Level’: Fmr. UN Humanitarian Chief
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc)
*  The world is getting smaller and smaller for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=0.0s)]
*  after the ICC issued arrest warrants for him and his former Secretary of Defence Yoav Galant, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=4.16s)]
*  as well as for a Hamas commander who may or may not be dead. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=9.56s)]
*  For Palestinians, it may be their first whiff of justice since the start of the genocide [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=12.8s)]
*  in Gaza more than 13 months ago. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=17.04s)]
*  And yet the crimes against them continue. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=19.5s)]
*  While US officials continue to insist that Israel is improving the humanitarian situation [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=22.12s)]
*  footage from the ground shows something quite different. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=27.64s)]
*  The head of UNRWA's legal office tweeted this video from there last week, showing the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=30.84s)]
*  utter scale of destruction caused by the Israeli war machine. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=34.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, this apocalyptic video shows Palestinians carrying a white flag, if only that made [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=37.88s)]
*  a difference to Israeli warplanes, as they flee with whatever is left of their lives [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  on their backs. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=47.64s)]
*  That clip was taken by the Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council and former [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=48.92s)]
*  UN humanitarian chief Jan Egerland, who visited Gaza earlier this month. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=53.31999999999999s)]
*  He describes the situation on the ground there as, quote, destruction beyond belief. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=57.64s)]
*  And he joins me now from Norway. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=62.67999999999999s)]
*  Jan Egerland, thanks so much for coming on Mahedi Unfiltered. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=64.36s)]
*  When you saw, I mean, before we get into the humanitarian side of things, I do want to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=67.52s)]
*  get your reaction, especially as I believe you're also the former Deputy Director of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=71.4s)]
*  Human Rights Watch, to what was a huge decision by the ICC to issue arrest warrants for Israeli [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=75.44s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Gallup. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=81.88s)]
*  What was your reaction when you heard that news? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=84.0s)]
*  Well, I wasn't that surprised, really, after having visited Gaza twice this last year, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=86.72s)]
*  seen the destruction, heard everything that has happened through the ears and eyes and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=95.28s)]
*  mouth of colleagues on the ground. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=101.68s)]
*  The ICC was not a court created to take African war criminals. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=106.56s)]
*  It was created to take international potential war criminals. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  And I'm glad they have now indicted people on both sides because there have been war [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  crimes on both sides in this horrific war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=126.36s)]
*  Yeah, and after the ICC issued those warrants, at least 88 Palestinians were killed by Israel [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=129.52s)]
*  in occupied Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=135.68s)]
*  Meanwhile, in Lebanon, Israel stepped up its attacks, killing at least 47 people there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=136.68s)]
*  Commenting on those attacks, the UN Special Rapporteur, Francesca Albanese, said it is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=141.28s)]
*  noticeable that as of January, at every move at the international justice level, there's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=145.96s)]
*  been an immediate intensification of lethal violence against Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=150.68s)]
*  I just wonder, is that a pattern that you or your team on the ground in Gaza has noticed [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=154.96s)]
*  that there are these intensifications of Israeli attacks at certain times when things are going [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=159.0s)]
*  on in the world? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=163.24s)]
*  That could be. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=165.4s)]
*  But as I see it, it's been horrific ever since the onslaught on Israel on the 7th of October, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=166.88s)]
*  where all of these horrific things happen in Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  The response has been disproportionate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=180.28s)]
*  It has not followed international law on there being distinction between military and civilian [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=185.12s)]
*  targets, that there should be precaution and that it should be proportional. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=192.08s)]
*  So basically, it's an indiscriminate warfare on Gaza after an indiscriminate attack on [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=197.68s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=205.24s)]
*  But I feel, you know, Israel as a member of the United Nations, created by the United [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  Nations, should really be better than Hamas, better than Hezbollah, better than militia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  Jan, describe your latest visit to the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  Is Gaza livable anymore? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=224.92000000000002s)]
*  Can the Palestinians still survive there, do you think? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=227.96s)]
*  Yeah, well, it depends on whether we will have access for the organizations who are there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=231.64000000000001s)]
*  I have 60-plus humanitarian workers, colleagues on the ground in Gaza. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=239.24s)]
*  We have hundreds of trucks in the pipeline. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=246.92s)]
*  We could do a lot more. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  So does UNRWA, so does the World Food Program, so does the Red Crescent, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=255.28s)]
*  But the problem is that it's not only an indiscriminate warfare that is killing thousands of women [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=262.76s)]
*  and children that are completely innocent. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=270.64s)]
*  No one doubts that of what happened on the seventh of October. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=274.24s)]
*  It's also a starvation policy against the entire population of Gaza. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=277.28s)]
*  So to me, this is the besieged areas of Syria all over again. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=285.4s)]
*  This is Eastern Ghouta outside of Damascus. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=293.91999999999996s)]
*  This is Eastern Aleppo. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=296.64s)]
*  This is the Yarmouk camp for Palestinians in Syria all over again. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=299.8s)]
*  Of course, the difference being, Jan, the world ostracized Bashar al-Assad, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=305.92s)]
*  sanctioned Bashar al-Assad. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=310.04s)]
*  That's not the case with Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=312.16s)]
*  How are the people in Gaza coping? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=315.24s)]
*  Jan, you met a lot of ordinary people, ordinary men, women and children, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=317.6s)]
*  nothing to do with Hamas, people, civilians suffering. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=321.12s)]
*  We are more than 13 months into this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=323.72s)]
*  How are they coping? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=325.72s)]
*  How resilient are they? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=326.72s)]
*  What do they say to you? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=327.72s)]
*  I mean, they are exhausted beyond belief. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=329.52s)]
*  They haven't fled once or twice. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=332.68s)]
*  The average colleague of mine, Palestinian women and men, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=335.6s)]
*  they've fled eight, nine, ten, up to 15 times. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  So basically, every three, four weeks, they have to flee from where they are. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=347.08s)]
*  From their home to their uncle, again destroyed, to a distant aunt, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=354.88s)]
*  again destroyed, to some tent somewhere, again have to leave, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=360.68s)]
*  then to perhaps a collective center, a school, then another drone coming [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  with a loudspeaker in the middle of the night saying, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=370.44s)]
*  if you love your children, leave within two hours with whatever you can carry. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=372.68s)]
*  They flee again and again. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=378.2s)]
*  It's...people cannot continue to live like this, but of course, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=380.68s)]
*  but of course, they have to because they have no alternative. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=386.68s)]
*  There is no escape from Gaza. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  Jan, you've worked in the humanitarian field at the highest levels [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=394.04s)]
*  all across the world for over two decades now. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=397.6s)]
*  How does Gaza compare to anything else you've seen in your career, in your life? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=400.88s)]
*  Well, it is unique in this one way. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=406.56s)]
*  I cannot recall so many people being confined to such a small area [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=412.76s)]
*  with no escape and under such bombardment for so long. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=420.48s)]
*  But that's why I bring up the besieged areas of Syria, where, yes, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=427.04s)]
*  I mean, of course, Assad was ostracized, as you say, by the West. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=434.48s)]
*  He had a lot of support from Russia and from Iran and so on. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=440.24s)]
*  This time it is happening with the Western arms, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=444.44s)]
*  which make it also more complicated for us really, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=449.08s)]
*  because it is the donors, the most generous countries, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=451.88s)]
*  to international solidarity. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=455.84s)]
*  I mean, it's not the Asian growing economies [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=457.64s)]
*  that are feeding children across Africa and so on. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=461.0s)]
*  It's North America, it's Europe, the European Union, et cetera. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  They provide relief for us and the bombs that is pummeling Gaza. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=469.12s)]
*  So it is unique in this way. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=477.6s)]
*  Of course, I'm just back from Sudan. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=480.48s)]
*  There are so many horror scenes on our watch, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=483.32000000000005s)]
*  but Gaza is in a way injustice, indiscriminate warfare [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=488.20000000000005s)]
*  on quite a different level. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=492.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'll come back to Sudan in a moment. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=496.16s)]
*  Just to stick you with Gaza, last week the State Department spokesperson, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=497.76s)]
*  Matt Miller, commented on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  saying, we have seen the situation improve. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=503.76s)]
*  Though to see the actual realization of all those improvements, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=506.24s)]
*  we do think will take some time. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=508.88s)]
*  I mean, you were in Gaza, you have colleagues still in Gaza. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=510.36s)]
*  Has the situation improved? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=513.2s)]
*  What is Matt Miller seeing that the rest of us are not? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=514.44s)]
*  No, well, that's beyond the belief what they're saying there, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=516.88s)]
*  because all of us, the aid organization on the ground, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=521.24s)]
*  have seen that it has not improved. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, after the US ultimatum, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=528.04s)]
*  improve the situation for the civilian population, Israel, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=533.16s)]
*  or we will cut military aid, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  because the deadline was just after the election, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=541.32s)]
*  the number of trucks went down. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=544.6s)]
*  It's been 37 trucks of aid on average a day since that time. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=547.28s)]
*  We needed more than 500 trucks. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=554.76s)]
*  Many of the trucks that, or rather, of the few trucks [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=558.92s)]
*  that make it into Gaza, which is besieged, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=563.36s)]
*  majority is being looted, plundered, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=568.36s)]
*  because there is no police there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=572.72s)]
*  The police was bombed to pieces by Israel, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=575.48s)]
*  and Israel are giving us aid routes that are unsafe, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=578.12s)]
*  and these gangs, mafias, certain families, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=583.5200000000001s)]
*  seem to be able to do whatever they want in Gaza now. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=588.32s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to ask you about the UN memo [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=593.44s)]
*  that the Washington Post obtained just recently, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=595.0s)]
*  saying that the looting activities are taking place, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=596.7600000000001s)]
*  but the gangs there, quote, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=599.48s)]
*  may be benefiting from a passive, if not active, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=600.7600000000001s)]
*  benevolence or protection from the Israeli military. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=603.8399999999999s)]
*  One gang leader, the memo said, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=606.5999999999999s)]
*  established a military-like compound in an area [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=608.1999999999999s)]
*  restricted, controlled and patrolled by the IDF. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=610.8399999999999s)]
*  Is that what your people are telling you as well is the case? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=614.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, what I saw with my own eyes [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=618.0s)]
*  coming over Keren Shalom, you know, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=621.0s)]
*  there is a special route now which is working. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=623.4s)]
*  We enter buses in Amman, Jordan, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=627.16s)]
*  and you get off when you reach Gaza, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=630.76s)]
*  Keren Shalom, border crossing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=634.0s)]
*  You go into armored UN vehicles and we go on. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=635.72s)]
*  They were loading some trucks behind us at that point. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=640.12s)]
*  We went four minutes from Keren Shalom, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=645.32s)]
*  and I saw maybe 100 young men with sticks [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  and with clubs and so on preparing themselves [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=654.52s)]
*  to take the five poor trucks following on. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=658.52s)]
*  With total impunity, there were Israeli snipers nearby. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=664.56s)]
*  I mean, you cannot walk. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=668.84s)]
*  If there had been a civilian policeman, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=670.72s)]
*  he would have been killed immediately. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=673.1999999999999s)]
*  So how come these gangs can roam freely, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=674.96s)]
*  loot everything and be part of a war economy [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=682.04s)]
*  that is enriching some in Gaza, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=685.1999999999999s)]
*  but really meaning that the vast majority are at starvation? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=688.04s)]
*  Do you think, and you're not just a former humanitarian chief, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=693.04s)]
*  you're also a former foreign minister for the Norwegians, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=696.04s)]
*  what do you make of what's coming our way geopolitically? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=698.64s)]
*  Donald Trump is going to be president on January 20th. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  Mike Huckabee is going to be the US ambassador to Israel [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=703.76s)]
*  who says there's no such thing as an occupation, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=706.3199999999999s)]
*  no such thing as the West Bank, no such thing as Palestinians. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=708.0s)]
*  What is coming down the line for Gaza and the West Bank [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=710.8399999999999s)]
*  in 2025 in your view? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=713.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, nobody knows really, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=715.72s)]
*  but I've reflected on this of late. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=719.32s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to put America first. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=723.44s)]
*  He may end the policy where the Biden administration [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=728.44s)]
*  has put Netanyahu first, America second, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=731.72s)]
*  and humanity third. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=736.4s)]
*  I think it could be that they would wake up [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=738.0400000000001s)]
*  by a Trump administration seeing that this is costing really [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=742.72s)]
*  Israel and the US a lot and the rest of the world, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=746.5600000000001s)]
*  because really it's the US, Germany, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=750.64s)]
*  to some extent Britain, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=756.0s)]
*  that is really supporting Israel now. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=757.64s)]
*  The rest of the world, including my own country, Norway, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=760.6800000000001s)]
*  which was instrumental in creating the state of Israel. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=763.6s)]
*  I mean, Norway had the first secretary general [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=767.88s)]
*  of the United Nations system. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=769.64s)]
*  He was key in this. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=771.8s)]
*  We were pro-Israel long before the US and UK, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=773.28s)]
*  and now Norway is basically saying, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=778.8s)]
*  this is not the Israel we grew to know. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=781.12s)]
*  This is not the IDF as a professional army we knew. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=785.3199999999999s)]
*  This has been extremism taking over Israel. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=789.56s)]
*  You have seen your fair share of suffering this month [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=794.12s)]
*  as you went from a genocide in Gaza [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=796.52s)]
*  to the worst displacement crisis in the world, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=800.3199999999999s)]
*  another genocide many would argue in Sudan, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=802.36s)]
*  where you wrote 14 million people have been driven [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=805.04s)]
*  from their homes by armed groups acting with impunity. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=807.1999999999999s)]
*  What is the humanitarian situation [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=810.8399999999999s)]
*  that we don't talk enough about like in Sudan right now? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=812.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's horrendous. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=816.8399999999999s)]
*  And of course, the difference between Gaza and Sudan [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=817.76s)]
*  is that Sudan is a very big place. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=820.88s)]
*  Gaza is a small place where 2 million people are confined [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  to besiegement and the bombing, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=829.48s)]
*  indiscriminate bombing and starvation. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=832.32s)]
*  Well, in Sudan, it's 24 million. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=834.76s)]
*  And they are, they were poorer to start with [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=837.72s)]
*  than even in Gaza. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=841.6800000000001s)]
*  And now 14 million people have fled. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=843.96s)]
*  More than 20 million need food aid, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=847.32s)]
*  which they are not getting in many parts of the country. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=850.76s)]
*  So I really felt it was an underfunded operation. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=853.52s)]
*  It's an under, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=857.68s)]
*  there is no attention to it, underreported emergency. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=861.64s)]
*  And it is complete impunity from all of these armed men [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=866.08s)]
*  who are willing to fight each other [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=870.6s)]
*  to the last woman and child. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=872.68s)]
*  I'm shocked over the size of the problem [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=875.12s)]
*  and that it is as neglected in the world as it is. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=878.52s)]
*  Gaza and Ukraine gets attention. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=883.36s)]
*  This gets no attention. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=886.16s)]
*  Why do you think that is, Jan? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=887.64s)]
*  I think it's a combination of things. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=890.8s)]
*  One is the world has become a colder [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=892.8399999999999s)]
*  and more nationalistic, egocentric place [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=897.4399999999999s)]
*  than it was 20 years ago [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=902.24s)]
*  when I was the UN humanitarian coordinator. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=903.64s)]
*  And we got not just George Clooney came with celebrities [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=907.36s)]
*  and the world press, as you may recall, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  but President Bush and Prime Minister Blair [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=914.84s)]
*  and the French president and the EU commission [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=917.52s)]
*  felt that the fall was really an outrage. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=920.48s)]
*  And they gave us all the money [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=923.2800000000001s)]
*  and there were collective pressure on Bashir, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=925.44s)]
*  on President Bashir, et cetera, in Sudan. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=928.2s)]
*  Now I feel that there is its nationalism [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=933.76s)]
*  and then there is a very polarized mood around Gaza. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=937.24s)]
*  And then there is Europe and the West [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=940.64s)]
*  seeing that Ukraine is a war in Europe. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=942.6s)]
*  That's very dangerous. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=945.0400000000001s)]
*  And that there ends international attention really. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=946.32s)]
*  So what I'm arguing is that if really our ideals [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=950.0400000000001s)]
*  is so worthless anymore, look at our interests. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=954.88s)]
*  If we're not providing relief and hope [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=958.64s)]
*  to the people of Sudan, of Gaza and of Lebanon, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=962.64s)]
*  Europe will wake up to a million people [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=967.48s)]
*  crossing the Mediterranean again. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=969.8399999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump will see that people will be flocking [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=973.64s)]
*  in greater numbers from Central America and elsewhere [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=976.4799999999999s)]
*  because there's no hope there. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=979.4799999999999s)]
*  So it is in conformity with our ideals [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=981.24s)]
*  and our interests to help in these situations. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=983.8399999999999s)]
*  Well said, we will have to leave it there. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=987.88s)]
*  Jan Egeland, thank you so much for your time. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9MZNGfQbtc&t=989.28s)]
