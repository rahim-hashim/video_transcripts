Video Description: In this special episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’, we’re at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, around the corner from the United Center, at the Palestinian-American owned OUD Coffee and Cafe. Mehdi is joined in this exclusive interview with prominent voices from the Uncommitted Movement – and just moments after it was revealed that the DNC would not be allowing a Palestinian to speak at the convention.

Joining ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’ are co-chair of the Uncommitted Movement Layla Elabed, who briefly spoke with Vice President Harris recently; former U.S. Representative from Michigan Andy Levin, a progressive, Jewish critic of Israel; and Georgia State Representative Ruwa Romman, the first Muslim-American woman, and first Palestinian-American to be elected to the state’s House of Representatives.

Just minutes before this recording began, the panel got word that the DNC officially confirmed a Palestinian speaker would not be brought to speak on stage at the convention on Thursday, despite officials suggesting to the movement earlier that it could happen. The DNC had gone so far as shortlisting potential speakers, according to unnamed members of the movement who spoke to Zeteo.

# Democrats Deny Request for Palestinian Voice on Convention Stage: Exclusive Roundtable Debate
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk)
*  We can see a Palestinian voice on stage at this DNC. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=0.0s)]
*  The whole point of any of this, it's about being able to show there is room in the party for us too. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=3.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, Mehdi, who is our most important other? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=9.4s)]
*  It's our Palestinian cousins. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=12.8s)]
*  This thing has been going on for decades, for generations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=15.0s)]
*  Party platform stated that the Democratic Party values Palestinian and Israeli lives equally. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=18.6s)]
*  How did they signal that this week? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=25.8s)]
*  If I texted the WhatsApp groups that I'm in right now and I said, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=29.0s)]
*  I need you to vote for Kamala Harris after what just happened this week, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=32.0s)]
*  they're literally going to tell me I have no shame. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=36.4s)]
*  As a representative, elected representative, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=38.4s)]
*  I'm sure many Palestinian Americans will come up to you and say, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=40.4s)]
*  what are you doing in that party? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=44.0s)]
*  Yeah, I really thought I could take something back after this week. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=45.6s)]
*  And now I don't know what I'm going to say to them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=48.6s)]
*  Welcome to a very special episode of Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=55.8s)]
*  I'm Mehdi Hasan. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=58.4s)]
*  We're here at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Actually, we're around the corner from the convention center [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=62.0s)]
*  at a brand new Palestinian American owned cafe here in Chicago [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=64.6s)]
*  called Oud Coffee and Cafe. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=68.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=70.0s)]
*  I urge you to check it out if you are in town. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=70.6s)]
*  Where better to discuss the Democrats and the uncommitted movement than here, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=73.2s)]
*  the pro-Palestine anti-war uncommitted movement, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=77.2s)]
*  which secured more than 700,000 votes in the Democratic Party primaries earlier this year, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=80.4s)]
*  more than 100,000 in Michigan alone, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=84.6s)]
*  and has sent 30 delegates from eight states to the DNC. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  And yet none of them have been up on the DNC stage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=90.8s)]
*  We haven't heard from an uncommitted speaker. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=93.8s)]
*  We haven't heard from a Palestinian speaker. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=95.6s)]
*  So who better to discuss all of this than with my special panel tonight? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=97.6s)]
*  Leila El-Abid is one of the founders of the national uncommitted movement [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=101.6s)]
*  from Dearborn, Michigan, longtime community organizer. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=104.8s)]
*  Roar Oman is a Democratic state representative from Georgia, from Atlanta, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=107.8s)]
*  the first Palestinian American, first Muslim American woman elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=111.8s)]
*  and Andy Levin, former two-term Democratic congressman from Michigan, a progressive. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  I should add a Jewish critic of Israel who locked horns, I think, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=122.2s)]
*  had a good fight with AIPAC in the past. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=125.2s)]
*  Brilliant panel here to talk about a very important subject. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=128.2s)]
*  Here we are at the DNC in Chicago, Wednesday, penultimate night. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=130.6s)]
*  Leila, are we going to see uncommitted on stage? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=135.6s)]
*  Are we going to see a Palestinian voice on stage at this DNC? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=138.4s)]
*  Well, in the most latest update that we've had, literally moments ago, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=142.4s)]
*  we received an answer to our demand to have a Palestinian speaker [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=148.4s)]
*  or have a speaker that can provide that very human impact testimony of our U.S. policy decisions. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=153.6s)]
*  We demanded that the DNC allow Dr. Tanya Hajhassen to fulfill that role. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  We have asked the DNC to allow Palestinian elected to fulfill that role. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=169.39999999999998s)]
*  People like Ruwa and Abdel Nasser Rashid, right here from Chicago, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  elected within their own party, Palestinian elected within their own party. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=182.2s)]
*  And we've just heard word that the answer is no. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=186.2s)]
*  The DNC has said officially no. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=189.0s)]
*  Officially, the answer is no. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=190.4s)]
*  Was there a chance before? Was there a negotiation underway? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  We thought we had been under, you know, doing those negotiations for the last several days. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=194.8s)]
*  We were being told it's a good thing. There's not a no answer. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=201.0s)]
*  There's not a yes answer. Keep giving us names. Keep giving us names. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=204.0s)]
*  We have given them names of elected. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=208.20000000000002s)]
*  We have given them names of Palestinian Americans who have family in Gaza. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=210.4s)]
*  We have given them names of Palestinian Americans who have lost family members in Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=214.8s)]
*  All to come to this moment of like, no, it's not going to happen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=220.2s)]
*  You mentioned one of the people you had mentioned, you had suggested was Ruwa Rahman, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  who's Georgia state representative. You are Palestinian American. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=229.2s)]
*  What does it feel to you tonight to see no Palestinian American on stage at the DNC [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=233.2s)]
*  in the midst of this brutal assault? People are still being killed even as the DNC is going on. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=239.0s)]
*  We had an Israeli hostage members family on stage, which I think we all support. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=243.6s)]
*  We all want the hostages released from Gaza, but no space for a Palestinian American boy such as yourself. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=248.1s)]
*  You're an elected Democratic lawmaker. You're not some outsider. You're not an agitator. You're a lawmaker. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very much a rule follower. Thanks to my mom. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=257.1s)]
*  She's really drilled it into me, which has made it very, you know, trying to keep the straight and narrow. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=260.3s)]
*  So you rushed the stage then. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=264.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, I don't think I have that kind of bravery. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=265.9s)]
*  But, you know, it is definitely very disappointing because one, I want to be very clear. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=269.5s)]
*  I'm so honored that you all even put me on that list. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=274.0s)]
*  I mean, I took that very, very seriously. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=276.3s)]
*  But at the same time, I just I don't think people understand the reason we are here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=279.90000000000003s)]
*  The whole point of any of this, it's not about who is on that stage. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=283.6s)]
*  It's about being able to show there is room in the party for us to we have heard from Republicans this week. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  We have heard from so many different stakeholders. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=294.2s)]
*  Our tent has now become massive, including, by the way, Republicans from my state. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=297.2s)]
*  And to think that those Republicans are allowed a bigger platform in my own party than me as an elected official, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=302.6s)]
*  who all I want to talk about is our stories about why we are there and the vision and the future that we think we can reach, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=309.6s)]
*  the promise that the Democratic Party can reach in this historic moment. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=316.3s)]
*  And instead, we're being told once again, no. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=320.2s)]
*  Andy, you were a member of Congress for two terms. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=323.4s)]
*  You've been in the Democratic Party for a long time. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=325.6s)]
*  Why? Why did what's the what do you think is the reasoning in the DNC in the Harris campaign? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  They just worried about this issue being in primetime. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=332.8s)]
*  You know, I don't really know, maybe, but I I'm disappointed because I think look, look at if you saw Bernie Sanders speech, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=336.1s)]
*  the biggest, but he didn't he didn't just say and the horrifying war in Gaza. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=347.0s)]
*  It was the biggest applause speech. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, the Democratic base, Jewish, Arab American, you know, African American, all of our amazing rainbow. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=353.5s)]
*  Like, you know, we're talking about the tent. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=361.79999999999995s)]
*  Really, there's a strong feeling across all the different parts of our party that we, you know, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=365.0s)]
*  we need a real ceasefire to end this horrifying violence. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=372.59999999999997s)]
*  And let me just say it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=378.4s)]
*  Before we came, I was able to see the hostage parents. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=380.7s)]
*  You know, they're from Chicago. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=384.2s)]
*  I didn't know anything about it before I saw them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=385.5s)]
*  So moved everybody in that halls crying. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  I was super moved by it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=390.0s)]
*  You know, I think the Democratic Party has to talk about the fact that we had a way better chance of getting more hostages out alive [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=392.0s)]
*  by not having this terrible war. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=402.5s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Forces have said that some of these hostages seem to have likely been killed when the IDF, you know, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=406.0s)]
*  blew up tunnels. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=413.29999999999995s)]
*  Just five of the six bodies that were brought back apparently allegedly killed by the idea. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=414.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=418.0s)]
*  So, you know, it wasn't even a good strategy for that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=418.29999999999995s)]
*  Why can't we talk about these things? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=422.2s)]
*  But look, I also am a little bit, you know, I have two really different perspectives on this. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  One is just as a person, a Jew of faith who takes my faith seriously, you know, the Torah says, our Bible says, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=431.7s)]
*  36 times some version of a mitzvah requirement, what we need to do that, you know, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  treat, love the stranger as yourself, the other. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=448.9s)]
*  There's different formulations, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=451.2s)]
*  Thirty six is a significant number for us. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=453.3s)]
*  Eighteen, you know, it's a double high. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=455.4s)]
*  You know, there's a lot to it. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=457.3s)]
*  Who is the most important at the end of the day, Mehdi, who is our most important other? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=460.0s)]
*  It's our Palestinian cousins. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=465.9s)]
*  This thing has been going on for decades, for generations. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=468.0s)]
*  And I believe Kamala Harris can change course and face it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=472.1s)]
*  But and so we I'm sure we'll talk about policy too. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=476.6s)]
*  But I do think it was if this is the decision, I think it's a mistake not look at I just I just met Rua like this amazing state [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=480.0s)]
*  legislator from Georgia and and and I guess the letter speak uncommitted movement, I guess gave a lot of options, you know, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=488.90000000000003s)]
*  that Dr. Tanya that was the same doctor on our panel on Monday. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=497.6s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=501.0s)]
*  She was on Christian. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=502.7s)]
*  I'm on CNN show. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=503.5s)]
*  She's good enough to show him, but not the DNC is so compelling and just talk. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=504.8s)]
*  She's totally nonpolitical. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=509.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=510.6s)]
*  You know, so anyway, it's it's disappointing to me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=511.0s)]
*  So let me ask you, you actually met with Kamala Harris briefly in a kind of rope line before the rally in Michigan about was in a 10 day there. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=513.6s)]
*  I can't keep track of days anymore. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=522.8000000000001s)]
*  Do you ask you as a Palestinian on this panel with Rua? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=525.2s)]
*  There's a whole debate about Palestinian invisibility and Tanya Hessey Coates, one of the great writers of our time, has just written a piece for Vanity Fair saying yesterday [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=529.7s)]
*  and he's and he's saying very he's saying very openly that there's no Palestinian on stage because they don't want to hear from them. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=537.1s)]
*  They don't want to see them. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=542.1s)]
*  They're very uncomfortable that they being the party leader. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=542.9s)]
*  How do you feel as a Palestinian within this movement? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=545.5s)]
*  Someone who got up close personal with the vice president who someone who clearly has empathy for people in you know, in trouble is a woman of color. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=548.3s)]
*  How did you feel? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=557.0999999999999s)]
*  I wonder when you met with her when I met with her, I felt that her empathy and her compassion towards me was very authentic and genuine. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=557.8s)]
*  And it was in a very emotional moment for me to sit there and face Vice President Kamala Harris and tell her that Michigan voters want to be able to vote for her. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=567.9s)]
*  But we can't do that with a policy that doesn't save the lives of people we love the lives of Palestinians who are the very reflection of our own community here in the United States. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=579.5999999999999s)]
*  These are people that share the same names of my own children. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=594.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=597.6s)]
*  And although she was very compassionate, very genuine, she listened to what I had to say. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  I told her about the tens of thousands tens to hundreds of family members that my community members are losing each day in the rest of because of our our tax dollars. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=604.5s)]
*  She said it's horrific. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=616.7s)]
*  And I asked her will you meet with us to discuss an arms embargo? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=618.1s)]
*  She said she would meet with us. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=621.4000000000001s)]
*  She didn't say she would agree to an arms embargo and her advisors very quickly came up the next day and she doesn't support arms embargo. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=623.0s)]
*  And we know that that's why we said we want to discuss with you an arms embargo because we know that is not the current policy. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=628.8s)]
*  But the current policy right now does not actually get us a ceasefire. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=635.5s)]
*  So you are in the uncommitted movement. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=641.9s)]
*  You are here at the DNC pressuring from within. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=643.8s)]
*  It's inside outside of strategy as the phrase goes. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=646.7s)]
*  Roy, you are a member of the House of Representatives. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=649.8s)]
*  You're a Democratic lawmaker. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=652.3s)]
*  What do you both say? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=654.4s)]
*  What do you say as a representative elected representative? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=655.5999999999999s)]
*  So I'm sure many Palestinian Americans who come up to you and say what are you doing in that party? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=658.5s)]
*  We we're not we're invisible to that party. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=663.5999999999999s)]
*  We're not represented. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=666.0s)]
*  I don't care about us. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=666.6999999999999s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=667.4s)]
*  I'm going to be honest with you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=668.6999999999999s)]
*  I really thought I could take something back after this week and now I don't know what I'm going to say to them. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=669.4s)]
*  I really don't because you know, none of us expect to change 80 years worth of policy, you know, in the course of a single election cycle. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=675.0s)]
*  That is absolutely not the you know, current aspect is not what is what is being demanded. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  What is being demanded at the most basic fundamental level is that for those of us who have given so much for this party because again, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=690.4s)]
*  I've been an organizer for 10 years, eight years longer than I've been elected official. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=697.9s)]
*  I have knocked doors. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=701.1s)]
*  I personally knocked doors for President Biden in Forsyth County in the cold on my own because I firmly believe that we could not have Trump again. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=702.8s)]
*  I am somebody who's turned out at this point tens of thousands of voters for the party. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=712.0999999999999s)]
*  I'm in a swing state. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=716.4s)]
*  I've done it consistently. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=717.4s)]
*  And when somebody tells me what are you doing in that party? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=719.1999999999999s)]
*  I used to be able to say this is the only party the only one that at least strives to do the right thing. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=721.8s)]
*  No, but there is no singular perfect party. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=728.4s)]
*  But our tent is big enough that I can see myself in it and that it matches my values of striving to be the best that we can be. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=730.9s)]
*  You won't see yourself on stage. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=738.4s)]
*  And to be clear again, it's not about me. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=740.1999999999999s)]
*  Just a similar Palestinian somebody who shares. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=741.8s)]
*  I just want to broaden it past just because you mentioned your state Georgia and I was going to get into later, but you mentioned it now this idea of being a swing state. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=745.4s)]
*  When we talk about swing states and I want to come back to Michigan and you mentioned earlier, obviously we talk about Arab Americans in Michigan. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=751.5s)]
*  But this is way beyond Arab Americans. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=757.0s)]
*  You're in Georgia where we know 11,000 votes. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=758.6s)]
*  Seven hundred and eighty. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=763.0s)]
*  We know because Donald Trump called up and said find me those votes. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=764.0s)]
*  And yet I believe six thousand uncommitted. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=766.8s)]
*  I think it's called what was it called in Georgia was a different name. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=769.6s)]
*  Leave it blank. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=771.8s)]
*  Leave it blank. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=772.3s)]
*  Six thousand people left it blank in the primaries. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=773.5s)]
*  That number may be bigger today given what's happened over the last few months. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=776.6s)]
*  And the New York Times reported that black pastors in Georgia were leading the movement against this genocide and calling for a ceasefire. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=779.6s)]
*  This is not just about Arab Americans in the tent. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=786.2s)]
*  This is as Andy mentioned earlier young people black people Jewish people. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=788.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean to be very clear our multi-faith multi-racial multi-generational coalition that has grown on this in Georgia is the reason I'm still alive today. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  I could not bear the weight of everything that has happened without them. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=801.6s)]
*  What we saw in Georgia truly was the future of this country. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=805.2s)]
*  And to see that be ignored particularly when the stakes are so high and I want to be clear. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=808.9000000000001s)]
*  Me as an elected official I care about my constituents. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=814.6s)]
*  I want to keep them safe as much as humanly possible. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=816.9s)]
*  And I'm Palestinian and now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place of what do I do ahead of November? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=819.7s)]
*  How can I turn out my community who by the way there's seventy six thousand registered Muslims in the state of Georgia. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=825.0s)]
*  There are fifty five thousand Arabs and we're not really sure how many of those are registered to vote. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=831.4s)]
*  But those are still way larger than the margin of victory for President Biden. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=835.0s)]
*  And I'm concerned and the only reason I'm here the only reason any of us are trying this hard is because we want to be able to deliver those votes come November. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=840.2s)]
*  And the I spoke to someone in the DNC a few months ago. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=847.9s)]
*  I said what about Michigan. Aren't you worried when Biden was still a candidate. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=851.3000000000001s)]
*  Aren't you worried about Michigan. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=854.6s)]
*  They said no we think we can win Michigan with suburban women on abortion and auto workers and labor. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=856.3000000000001s)]
*  We don't need Arab Americans or young people. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=862.9s)]
*  What's your reaction to that. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=866.2s)]
*  You know I for one thing. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=867.2s)]
*  There's so many Arab Americans are auto workers. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=872.4000000000001s)]
*  I just have to say you know thousands and thousands. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=877.0s)]
*  We have three hundred thousand Middle East North African people were beyond our Arab American population. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=880.6s)]
*  We're a big Muslim state of you know other black Muslims South Asian Muslims right. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=888.7s)]
*  You mentioned the black pastors bishops of the AME Church right called out this issue thousands of black pastors around the country. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=894.5s)]
*  So it's an issue that cuts across the progressive base the base of the Democratic Party in Michigan. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=902.6s)]
*  And I particularly want to call out one thing about Michigan that we're super proud of. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=909.0s)]
*  We have done and we're recognized by the about for this the Roosevelt Institute just put out a little report Michigan's done the best of any state on what you might call [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=913.5s)]
*  Democratic with a small the Democratic hygiene. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=922.5s)]
*  You know same day registration motor voter no reason absentee college students being able to vote where they are studying. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=925.1999999999999s)]
*  You can register and vote right up to the polls close on and on from 2018 to 2022 Michigan increased its youth vote more than any other state. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=933.8s)]
*  And in 2022 we had the highest vote rate of youth voting. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=943.3s)]
*  And then what are we going to squander all this because young people are so deeply into this issue and you have to just I don't think the people understand in the in the campaign or in the DNC [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=948.2s)]
*  on a college campus in Michigan since we're by far the most densely Arab American state like if we're a bunch of sophomores in our dorm or for a bunch of students in a frat or a sorority or in a dining hall. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=962.4s)]
*  There are Palestinian Americans in our friend groups and let's say we're all students here. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=974.8000000000001s)]
*  Let's say none of us are political right. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=979.2s)]
*  And a Palestinian American friend runs in crying. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=982.4000000000001s)]
*  What's the matter. 12 of my cousins were just wiped out. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=986.0s)]
*  Their apartment block was imploded by a 2000 pound bomb. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=989.3000000000001s)]
*  We're all going to start crying. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=993.3000000000001s)]
*  We're all going to start hugging. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=994.7s)]
*  We're never going to forget this moment for the rest of our lives. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=995.9000000000001s)]
*  And this all of a sudden our parents going to be like what happened to you. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=999.9000000000001s)]
*  You're all political because we're all part of that friend's cause because we can't stand for it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1002.8s)]
*  So I am look I don't want Donald Trump anywhere near the White House ever again. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1008.8s)]
*  I've said from the beginning of my support for these amazing young organizers like Layla who created this you know listen to Michigan movement that became the uncommitted national movement. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1015.0s)]
*  I'm I was going to vote for Biden. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1025.1s)]
*  I'm definitely voting for Harris but I want to help her in Michigan. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1026.5s)]
*  You can't win the White House without winning Michigan on because of the stupid Electoral College right. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1031.0s)]
*  You need those Michigan's Electoral College 15 Electoral College votes. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1036.8000000000002s)]
*  And I don't maybe you could win Michigan without but any sensible organizer would want to be complacent with our stupid college and Donald Trump. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1040.4s)]
*  It's worse neck and neck in the polls. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1051.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1053.0s)]
*  Layla let me ask you this and I do want to come back to Michigan and you're from Deaborn I know but just on the policy front let's say they had we started this [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1053.5s)]
*  conversation talking about this kind of quote unquote breaking news this evening here on a Wednesday evening in Chicago that there isn't going to be a Palestinian voice on the DNC stage before it's over tomorrow night. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1060.7s)]
*  But let's say they had put a Palestinian voice on stage. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1070.2s)]
*  Let's say they had put Ruwan Sayed and we heard a great speech and we heard Palestinian humanity expressed from the podium. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1072.8s)]
*  But then the policy still didn't change. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1079.5s)]
*  You still leave Chicago with Palestinians being killed with American bombs and the policy that you are now calling for is some form of arms embargo conditioning of aid. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1081.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris is former National Security Advisor said on a panel a few days ago. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1091.3s)]
*  There will be no conditioning of aid in her view. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1094.3999999999999s)]
*  Phil Gordon who's the current National Security Advisor to the vice president put out a tweet the day after you met with Harris saying she doesn't support an arms embargo. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1097.8999999999999s)]
*  So it's not looking good on the policy front. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1106.1999999999998s)]
*  Or is there some do you think there's some there's some place for some movement at some point. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1109.6999999999998s)]
*  I do think you know in having a speaker on the stage of the Democratic National Convention was a demand that we had a movement demand that we had of the DNC. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1114.3999999999999s)]
*  It is not the demand of our movement overall is just to have a speaker. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1126.8s)]
*  Yes it was one. But the party platform was revealed on Monday and that part had a party platform stated that the Democratic Party values Palestinian and Israeli lives equally. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1131.2s)]
*  Yeah. How did they signal that this week during the Democratic National Convention not have not having one Palestinian American speaker. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1143.7s)]
*  And even though you guys turn up with 700,000 votes under your belt they've had 700,000 more than some of the pro Harris Republic exactly not only they had Republicans speak on that stage. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1155.3s)]
*  They even had a border patrol officer speak on that stage but they couldn't find one Palestinian. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1165.7s)]
*  But they could find they just don't want to give anyone. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1171.7s)]
*  And it's almost like our tears our pain our suffering. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1174.0s)]
*  Is doesn't matter. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1181.2s)]
*  You know my sister she often says that a Palestinian child's cries is no different than an Israeli child's cries. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1184.1s)]
*  But what just happened this week and the fact that our request was denied signal to all of us that is not true that they do not value our lives the same. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1191.8999999999999s)]
*  And when it comes to policy the least that we could do this administration and vice president Harris could do is follow our own justice system because right now we are violating right. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1201.8999999999999s)]
*  We're in right now. We are in violation of our own laws. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1213.2s)]
*  In international law which says you can't use weapons. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1217.3000000000002s)]
*  You can't provide weapons to wear human rights violations are being documented. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1219.9s)]
*  Let me ask you this and the quick question on Layla mentioned her sister Rashida Congresswoman Rashida to live of Michigan who isn't at the DNC this year. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1223.6000000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this question and the only Palestinian American in Congress. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1232.8000000000002s)]
*  Was censured by Congress in the midst of all this not the Republicans who said turn Gaza into a parking lot who made genocidal statements about Palestinians. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1238.5s)]
*  But the woman who said I want everyone to be free but she said between the river and the sea and I love to say that I got asked a question you went up against a pack in your own race. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1249.6s)]
*  You lost in 2022. Are we seeing any movement in terms of the Democrats in Congress changing their positions on Israel Palestine standing up to a pro-Israel lobby. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1259.3999999999999s)]
*  I saw a speaker on stage. I can't remember who on a Monday or Tuesday night say we took on the gun lobby and we beat them. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1271.5s)]
*  And I think I tweeted will we ever hear a Democrat say on a DNC stage we took on the pro-Israel lobby and beat them. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1277.1s)]
*  Will that day ever come. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1282.6999999999998s)]
*  Well you know I think a pack is you know becoming it's completely lost its soul. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1284.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean it's in the Democratic Party faces an existential issue over this not just because of this one issue but because of what it means to let a Republican billionaires come in [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1293.6s)]
*  and determine the outcomes of Democratic primaries right. But I I really what Congress does on this matters a lot. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1310.8s)]
*  But I think you know and I was a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and I think the Article 1 body Congress which holds all the purse strings including all the foreign you know spending we do on all military humanitarian everything. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1319.6000000000001s)]
*  I think Congress needs to re take its its proper role on foreign policy in a stronger way like we have these authorizations for use of military force from forever ago that we don't get rid of all those should have a have a you know time limit and all that. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1336.9s)]
*  But listen I just I think in our tradition even if we did that the president the role the president in foreign affairs is really strong and so I want to keep the focus on Vice President Harris and I'm not giving up. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1353.3s)]
*  What about Joe Biden what's going on there. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1368.7s)]
*  Guys not even running for reelection anymore. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1371.3s)]
*  Well no. So this is this this is an excellent point and he just signed off on I think 20 billion dollars. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1373.1000000000001s)]
*  But I think that Vice President Harris is in a difficult position here right. She's the vice president. He's the president. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1377.6999999999998s)]
*  But she's who I'm focused on. I don't expect change from President Biden on this. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1383.5s)]
*  Harris should distance herself from well because you know your senator in Michigan Gary Peters said recently at Politico that he thinks she holds different views. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1389.1999999999998s)]
*  And when he was asked by the Politico reporter should she make them clear he said yes yes. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1396.6s)]
*  And I that Gary Peters is a really smart politician who's very careful and what he says is very considerate and he's in charge of the Senate. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1400.6999999999998s)]
*  You know elect you know reelection effort that to try to to you know hold the majority which is going to be super tough. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1410.8s)]
*  So I think there's a significance there. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1417.3s)]
*  What I really want to emphasize is as disappointing as not having a speaker as a Palestinian speaker on stage in prime time which is very disappointing. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1419.3s)]
*  To be honest I'm much more focused on the policy. And we the policy is most important and I am not giving up at all. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1429.9s)]
*  It's look she just became the nominee. This is crazy. She's filling out her team right. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1437.7s)]
*  I'm going to we I want to keep you know our eyes on the prize of getting her to say things as as as Senator Peters says that you know if you have your own views express them. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1444.2s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of space for her to do this in a way that would make people in the community feel like OK you know I want to give her a chance. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1458.1s)]
*  Very few people look Muslims have fundamentalist just like Christians and Jews. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1467.8s)]
*  So there's these people in Dearborn and every other part who are like you know banned books and you know no abortion ever. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1472.1s)]
*  I mean there are Muslims like that too. So they might vote you know Arab American and otherwise. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1478.6s)]
*  And I and by the way in my reelection when I was strongly supported by the Muslim community this is something to pay attention to because some of them would say oh you know we're supporting you and stuff. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1483.1s)]
*  But you have to do something to protect our children. I'm like what. And then they would say like well they can't be you know I want to get off track. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1491.6s)]
*  But listen she can do she could say yes as as as Leila said let's work it and when I'm president yes we're going to follow you as one international law. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1498.3s)]
*  Is what Hubert Humphrey did in 68 distance himself from LBJ on Vietnam narrowed the gap in the polls he did in September 68. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1508.5s)]
*  Finally disowned LBJ but it was too late too late and he lost by point seven percent. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1515.4s)]
*  Yes yes so we don't want to see that happen with Donald Trump benefiting. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1519.9s)]
*  Well I want to come back to you on the convention before I do just stay on that point about some people you know will never vote for of the uncommitted movement. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1523.8s)]
*  What proportion would say what proportion would say you know what we're not just trying to you know there's a whole punish Biden phrase. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1531.7s)]
*  We don't we're not about punishing. We do want change. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1537.4s)]
*  And if there is some kind of indication of change we'll give her the benefit of the doubt. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1539.7s)]
*  There was just a poll that came out. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1543.4s)]
*  I think it was an IME you pull you go. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1547.8s)]
*  Yes that said that if Vice President Kamala Harris came out with a policy that saved lives right now. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1550.0s)]
*  A form of arms embargo. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1559.7s)]
*  Yes that she would win those key swing states. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1561.2s)]
*  I think more than a third of voters are more likely to vote. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1564.5s)]
*  Yes more likely to vote for her. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1566.8s)]
*  And so these are folks who do not. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1569.2s)]
*  These are Democratic voters who don't want to see Trump elected but want their their children and their family members and their communities here and abroad to be protected because let's not ignore what has happened here in the last few months. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1571.7s)]
*  It hasn't been just the rise of anti-Semitism but there's been a rise in anti-Arab hate Islamophobia anti-Palestinian hate. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1588.9s)]
*  What do you have for you me from Illinois. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1596.2s)]
*  Was stabbed to death for being Palestinian. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1599.2s)]
*  The three men from Vermont one who's going to be paralyzed for the rest of his life and the and the mother from Texas who literally had to save her children from being drowned by a racist. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1601.8000000000002s)]
*  Very good point. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1612.5s)]
*  And it all has to be part of this. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1613.4s)]
*  And this all of this has to be a part of this. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1614.7s)]
*  So on that note we actually saw an act of violence against a Muslim woman in a headscarf here at the DNC this week. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1616.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the video. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1624.0s)]
*  There was a guy with I love Joe Biden flagpole on tape on Monday night. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1625.2s)]
*  I think it was lent forward and hit a protest who was peacefully quietly just unfurling a delegate a delegate a Harris delegate hit her on the head. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1631.8s)]
*  I'm amazed that that person hasn't been found hasn't been banned hasn't been suspended hasn't been asked to leave. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1641.8s)]
*  I mean we've just normalized Islamophobia and anti-Arab haters later pointed out how is that. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1646.8999999999999s)]
*  I can't imagine any other community any other minority religious or racial that happening on camera in primetime in an arena. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1651.7s)]
*  And there's no outcry no condemnation from the DNC leadership no punishment. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1659.2s)]
*  I mean to be clear I don't know who the delegate was that had the sign. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1664.2s)]
*  I don't think they may even know but I do want to share this because I think this is the part that keeps getting missed in viral videos and polarization increased polarization. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1666.9s)]
*  Because today this point the reason uncommitted is so powerful is it showed not just told about what people were feeling when it came to the presidential cycle in a way that could not be spun away and key swing. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1677.7s)]
*  That's what makes this so powerful and the reason we are worried and to your point about the convention is that again the biggest applause lines were when we heard about a ceasefire. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1689.5s)]
*  If you walk through the halls of the convention so many I would say the majority of people are wearing kufi as are wearing uncommitted paraphernalia they've got pins they've got flags. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1698.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean I have never ever I'm 31 years old I have never seen this kind of care for Palestinians in my entire life. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1708.0s)]
*  And so the part that I don't understand is that we're allowing that image to take hold about the DNC when we literally have exactly literally. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1717.2s)]
*  I was just on my way here from the United Center and someone stopped me to please keep speaking for Palestine delegate so then there's a disconnect right this is why American democracy is in trouble where it's not just Palestine there's multiple issues where the public are in one place and the elected representatives are another partly because of lobby groups partly because of other interests. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1727.6999999999998s)]
*  But you're optimistic and I get a sense from you that you're still optimistic. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1747.3999999999999s)]
*  Well I think I think the different things tell you what I tell you what I think Rua and Layla are here right. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1751.3s)]
*  And I'm here I went I was in the hall the last two nights it's electric people are so excited. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1758.6s)]
*  I'm so grateful to Joe Biden that he stepped aside after that disastrous debate he would I think he did you know that I have many problems with especially about certain foreign policy things. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1766.8999999999999s)]
*  But I was so proud to serve with them in the 117th Congress and all the stuff the legislation we passed on climate change which is getting way too little attention here climate change and you know investing in America and blah blah blah. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1777.1999999999998s)]
*  But to be to be a Palestinian American here and all that electricity excitement and this first Indian American black woman president ever you know worse and you're not part of it. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1789.0s)]
*  You're somehow why why are not be part of it. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1803.0s)]
*  I think that's very upsetting to people and I think a lot of delegates the very people crying such real tears over like imagine the pain of a parent you know with a 23 year old son who's been you know in captivity. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1805.4s)]
*  That's a war crime you know for 300 however many days and then you your pain isn't part of it too. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1822.5s)]
*  And I don't understand how that helps the party. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1829.8s)]
*  I don't think it helps the party. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1832.5s)]
*  I think it's it's not a good idea before we run out of time later. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1834.0s)]
*  Where does uncommitted go from here from Chicago. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1836.5s)]
*  You know we were really hoping to leave Chicago and be able to mobilize voters especially in key swing states like Michigan. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1839.9s)]
*  So we have that fighting chance in November. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1848.2s)]
*  In all honesty we will continue talking about the dangers of a Trump presidency because we know what that's going to mean not just for us here that are organizing and advocating for human rights for Palestine. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1851.1000000000001s)]
*  But we know how much worse it's going to be for Palestinians. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1865.1000000000001s)]
*  We already know that Donald Trump uses Palestinian like it's an ethnic slur. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1867.9s)]
*  We know that he has promised his mega donors to annex the West Bank where my family is currently currently lives to be part of Israel. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1872.4s)]
*  Jared's got his eyes on property in Gaza. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1884.0s)]
*  He literally when he was president his administration he moved the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem a direct attack on Palestinians self right to self-determination. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1886.2s)]
*  And we know that he's already said in project 2025 that the type of work that I'm doing that the uncommitted movement is doing is going to be movements that are going to be criminalized. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1898.5s)]
*  So we know how much worse it's going to be not just for us but the communities we love and care about a lot of liberals in that convention sent a lot of blue no matter who partisans will say but you're to blame if he wins. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1909.1999999999998s)]
*  No that's what they'll say asking our elected and our candidates for presidency to listen to the core base of their voters which 86 percent of Democratic voters wants a permanent immediate ceasefire. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1921.6s)]
*  And I think it's 53 percent wants conditioning on funding to Israel. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1936.0s)]
*  People do not want to see our tax dollars being used to kill men women and children. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1941.3s)]
*  But at the end of the day come November Kamala Harris does not shift on this. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1946.3s)]
*  That is something that she has to answer to when you vote for her in November she doesn't shift right now. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1949.8999999999999s)]
*  There is I need to see a policy change how she's going to protect people that I love and care about. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1955.1s)]
*  And I cannot recommend a vote for her in this moment. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1961.8999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1967.1s)]
*  You're an activist an organizer. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1967.5s)]
*  Yeah but I know how dangerous Trump was elected Democrat. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1969.0s)]
*  Now still at the beginning of school again as we wrap up somebody comes to you and says how are you voting. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1972.3999999999999s)]
*  I'll follow your lead. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1977.1s)]
*  Yeah I mean the problem is that I wish people followed my lead when it comes to voting. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1978.1s)]
*  That's why we're here. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1982.5s)]
*  That's why we are raising the alarms. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1983.4s)]
*  I mean we you know we might be in two different places but again I'm an elected official I am around a very different group of people. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1984.9s)]
*  And so where my mind is is very different. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1991.0s)]
*  But I do know for a fact if I texted the WhatsApp groups that I'm in right now and I said I need you to vote for Kamala Harris after what just happened this week. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=1993.7s)]
*  They're literally going to tell me I have no shame. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2002.0s)]
*  And the thing is the point of this week was to try to reduce that anger. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2004.6s)]
*  It was to because I was very different WhatsApp conversation tomorrow night. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2007.8s)]
*  You were coming off a stage having spoken about your grandfather. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2011.1s)]
*  But I want to make this note because we I feel like nobody is talking about this in 2016 a very sophisticated miss and disinformation campaign effectively suppress the vote. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2014.1s)]
*  There is the same kind of suppressive campaign happening right now online using this very issue because it is very real and it is very visceral and it is dividing our communities. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2023.7s)]
*  And my worry isn't just for the election. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2033.1999999999998s)]
*  It's what's going to happen after when our party is dependent on a broad and beautiful coalition. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2035.6s)]
*  The broad and beautiful coalition is still fighting to survive. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2041.3999999999999s)]
*  I think we'll leave it on that note Andy Levin Ruralman Layla El Abed. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkxLYHPQUzk&t=2044.1999999999998s)]
