Video Description: Palestinian Pastor Munther Isaac of Bethlehem’s Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church accuses Christian evangelicals in the U.S. of abandoning their fellow Christians in the Occupied Territories.

“They [US Christian evangelicals] have created a worldview in which support to Israel is integral to this American identity, American exceptionalism, American national Christian identity,” says Munther, a worldview that he thinks would change if they were to visit occupied Bethlehem, for Christians the birthplace of Christ, and see the situation on the ground for themselves.

Munther is no stranger to the apartheid rule of Israel, where government policy and a 708-kilometer separation wall disrupt the worship of thousands of Palestinian Christians.

Recalling conversations with fellow evangelicals from South Africa, Munther says they described the situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories as being “much worse than apartheid,” adding that “you would assume that people would respect what South African theologians, church leaders are saying.”

# This Pastor in Bethlehem denounces US evangelicals for abandoning Palestinian Christians
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [June 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U)
*  The Israeli government wants the West to believe that it is the last line of defense for Western civilization against the Islamist hordes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=0.0s)]
*  Netanyahu and co. claim to be fighting against the Sharia-loving Muslim extremists of Hamas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=7.0s)]
*  The thing is, if that's the case, why then do they keep attacking and killing Palestinian Christians? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=12.0s)]
*  Yes, Palestinian Christians. The folks you don't really hear about much here in the Christian majority West. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=18.0s)]
*  At least 50,000 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem are believed to be Christians. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=25.0s)]
*  Pre-October the 7th, at least 1,000 Christians lived in Gaza, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=30.0s)]
*  dating back to the 1st century and to Philip the Evangelist from the New Testament. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=36.0s)]
*  And yet, just in the first month of Israel's brutal assault on Gaza, the Israeli military bombed the compound of the Strip's oldest church, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=40.0s)]
*  killing 16 Palestinian Christians sheltering there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=48.0s)]
*  The church, more than 800 years old, suffered damage to its facade and an adjacent building collapsed as a result of the strike. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=51.0s)]
*  Then in December, an Israeli military sniper shot and killed two women inside the Holy Family Parish in Gaza, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=58.0s)]
*  an action described by the most senior Catholic cleric in England as a cold-blooded killing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=64.0s)]
*  Just days later, over in the occupied West Bank this past December, holiday celebrations at the world's capital of Christmas, Bethlehem, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=70.0s)]
*  were cancelled by Palestinian Christians in solidarity with their brothers and sisters in Gaza. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=77.0s)]
*  But look, even before October the 7th, Israeli government policy was restricting the rights of Palestine's Christians. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=82.0s)]
*  And that's not me saying that, it's the US government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=88.0s)]
*  Yes, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom wrote in a report on Israel's apartheid wall, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=91.0s)]
*  which is, in fact, the most difficult for Palestinian Christians who live on the Jerusalem side of the barrier. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=107.0s)]
*  So where is the outrage from Christians here in America? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=113.0s)]
*  From evangelicals in the South, for example, who love to speak up in outrage over the persecution of Christians in places like China or North Korea, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=117.0s)]
*  but not in Palestine. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=125.0s)]
*  Why have Palestine's Christians been abandoned and ignored in this way? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=128.0s)]
*  Who better to ask than Reverend Dr. Muntah Isaac, Academic Dean of the Bethlehem Bible College in Palestine, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=133.0s)]
*  Director of Christ at the Checkpoint Conference. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=138.0s)]
*  He pastors at the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church in Bethlehem and is here this week on a visit to Washington, D.C. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=141.0s)]
*  Pastor, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=147.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=149.0s)]
*  For starters, I know that members of your congregation in Bethlehem, in the West Bank, have family in Gaza. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=150.0s)]
*  How are they doing? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=156.0s)]
*  No one's doing well in Gaza. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=158.0s)]
*  Everybody is impacted by this war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=160.0s)]
*  I mean, they're fortunate if you survive, actually, right now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=163.0s)]
*  They thought they would be safe in the church. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=167.0s)]
*  They took refuge in the two churches, the Orthodox and Catholics, but tragically, people were killed in both churches as a result of Israeli attacks. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=170.0s)]
*  And right now, the biggest problem they're facing is the lack of medicine and food. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=179.0s)]
*  Many from the Christian community were killed because there is no hospitals, there's no medicine. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=186.0s)]
*  Chances are, right now, if you get sick in Gaza, that you won't survive. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=192.0s)]
*  It's been traumatizing for us to witness because they're very close by, but we can do nothing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=197.0s)]
*  And all we can do is, if lucky, get hold of them on the phone to encourage and say anything, you know, just to comfort them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=205.0s)]
*  On the other hand, we're trying our best to mobilize church leaders around the world to speak out for the Christians in Gaza, but also for everyone involved in Gaza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=214.0s)]
*  It's a tragic humanitarian situation right now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=223.0s)]
*  What is your understanding of the situation on the ground in Gaza, specifically for Palestinian Christians who are trying to worship? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=226.0s)]
*  Because in Jabalia refugee camp, we recently saw Friday prayers held for Muslims for the first time since the start of this conflict. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=233.0s)]
*  Do Christians in Gaza have any safe places left to worship in? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=240.0s)]
*  They're taking refuge literally inside the two churches, so they're praying almost every day. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=244.0s)]
*  This is the only thing they can do right now because nowhere is safe, and they think at least within the church compound it's safe. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=250.0s)]
*  But many of the regular prayers were impacted. Christmas was not the same. Easter was not the same. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=260.0s)]
*  One of the oldest traditions in Palestine is the Holy Saturday tradition in which the light comes out of the church of the Holy Sepulchre and then literally goes all over the world. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=267.0s)]
*  And this was the first year that it did not get into Gaza. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=276.0s)]
*  Everybody is impacted right now by this war. And as I said, they're fortunate if they can only survive. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=281.0s)]
*  It's a war of a genocide that has literally left no one safe and nowhere is safe. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=288.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the West Bank. There has been, while we've all been focused on Gaza, the world, there's been an increase in violence in the West Bank, a rampage by settlers against Palestinians. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=296.0s)]
*  Has there been an increase in specifically anti-Christian violence in the occupied West Bank since October the 7th, in your view? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=308.0s)]
*  And do you believe Palestinian Christians are being targeted by the Israeli far right, by messianic Jewish settlers, for example? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=315.0s)]
*  This is not a matter of opinion. The statistics and reports about incitements and attacks against Christians testify to that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=322.0s)]
*  And in fact, even Israeli human rights organizations are raising concern about the fact that these incitements that are targeting Christians specifically in East Jerusalem, but within also the West Bank, are on the rise. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=330.0s)]
*  And it did not start on October 7th. It actually, it has been going for a while, but since this current Israeli government took over, we've seen a big rise in these incidents of spitting at clergy, attacking cemeteries, attacking churches, arsons at churches. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=345.0s)]
*  And many times when I hear about how these reports, these incidents are reported, the focus is on fringe messianic Jewish groups. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=365.0s)]
*  The problem is not only that. The problem is the structure that protects them, because right now they feel they have immunity. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=377.0s)]
*  Right now they feel they are protected. And certainly after October 7th, with all the focus, and rightly so, on Gaza, they have been unleashed, attacking everybody, including Christians. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=384.0s)]
*  And in the West Bank, while the world is watching Gaza and the focus there, settler activities is on the rise, settler violence and land confiscation and building of settlements on land confiscated from Palestinians, including Palestinian Christians, is also on the rise. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=397.0s)]
*  You've mentioned in the past that one of the biggest problems you're facing in the West Bank as a Christian community is the exodus of young Christian Palestinians due to life under occupation. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=413.0s)]
*  The Israelis and their supporters in the West often blame Hamas and the rise of Islamic extremism for the exodus of Palestinian Christians from both Gaza and the West Bank. What is your response to that line of argument? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=422.0s)]
*  My response is come and talk to these people who are leaving and ask them why are they leaving. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=433.0s)]
*  We're tired as Palestinian Christians from people speaking about us and framing the narrative in a way that fits their own political agenda, rather than listening to our concerns. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=438.0s)]
*  It's impossible to flourish as any community right now in the West Bank. It takes us sometimes two to three hours to get from Bethlehem to Ramallah, because we can't access, of course, to Jerusalem and the checkpoints are becoming more and more difficult. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=448.0s)]
*  Life under an Israeli occupation system that's so brutal that controls every element of our lives is so difficult. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=462.0s)]
*  But we must ask the question, why is it being phrased this way? Why is it always as if, you know, Muslims are to blame for the exodus of Christians? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=470.0s)]
*  Again, because it fits a certain narrative. It serves a certain agenda and people in the West would go crazy if a church is attacked by Muslims in the West Bank. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=480.0s)]
*  But we've seen all these incidents and it's not just the incidents, it's the limitation of our freedom. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=493.0s)]
*  It's probably the biggest, the two biggest problems we're facing right now as a Christian community in the West Bank. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=499.0s)]
*  One is the confiscation of our land. We cannot expand. We cannot live. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=505.0s)]
*  And when I say our land, I'm not making a political statement that this is Palestinian land. I'm talking about land we've farmed and inherited for generations. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=510.0s)]
*  This is the difference when we say this is our land. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=518.0s)]
*  So we're not able to flourish as a community in the Bethlehem area in particular, because Israel confiscated most of the land that was supposed to be part of the three municipalities in the Bethlehem area where most Christians live. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=522.0s)]
*  The second is the family registration system. The majority of Palestinian Christians live outside and are denied to come back to their homeland. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=534.0s)]
*  In some instances, Palestinian Christians, like all Palestinians, are forced to leave Palestine because they can't be with their spouses. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=542.0s)]
*  So if I as a Palestinian marry a foreign spouse, Israel would not grant that spouse a visa to come and live in Palestine. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=551.0s)]
*  So what do you do? You just end up leaving. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=558.0s)]
*  If a Palestinian from the West Bank marries a Palestinian from East Jerusalem, it's also complicated. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=561.0s)]
*  All of these policies that have been rightly described as apartheid are causing Palestinians to leave, including Palestinian Christians as well. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=566.0s)]
*  You're here in the U.S. You're in Washington, D.C. right now on a visit. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=576.0s)]
*  Have you spoken to Christian evangelicals here in the U.S. and asked them why they so strongly, some would say so blindly, support Israel over their own Christian brethren like yourself living under military occupation? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=580.0s)]
*  Do you feel betrayed by them? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=595.0s)]
*  We certainly feel betrayed. The reason is this theology called Christian Zionism, which is so prevalent among evangelical circles. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=597.0s)]
*  And it's deeper than simply how we read the Bible. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=607.0s)]
*  To them, they have created a worldview in which support to Israel is integral to this American identity, American exceptionalism, American national Christian identity. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=611.0s)]
*  Part of it is support to Israel. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=625.0s)]
*  And they read the Bible, and they only think that the right way to read it is to support Israel. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=629.0s)]
*  And when you couple that with really very limited awareness of what's happening on the ground, ignorance to be honest, because I meet with these pastors all the time. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=635.0s)]
*  And the thing that usually changes them is when they come to Bethlehem, they're shocked. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=647.0s)]
*  And they always say, we didn't know. We wish we knew. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=653.0s)]
*  So it's ignorance on that? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=656.0s)]
*  It's ignorance. And then the mere fact that Palestinian Christians exist, and then they come and see the wall. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=657.0s)]
*  They see how we live in, within basically concentrate, you know, very compacted areas, whereas the settlements are flourishing around us makes them, you know, ask questions. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=663.0s)]
*  And that allows us to open the Bible and say, do you really support the concept of a tribal God, of a racist God? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=675.0s)]
*  So we're trying to have these conversations. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=682.0s)]
*  By and large, we have a problem. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=685.0s)]
*  But for the first time, we feel some are beginning to listen. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=687.0s)]
*  For the first time, we feel maybe we have an opportunity to engage. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=691.0s)]
*  And I think Gaza has made many question their assumptions. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=696.0s)]
*  And of course, we should point out black and Latino evangelicals do not take the same position as their white evangelical brethren. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=703.0s)]
*  We talk about evangelicals. We're talking very much about white Christian evangelicals. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=709.0s)]
*  Black pastors have come out very strongly in support of Gaza. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=713.0s)]
*  But what's interesting is you're saying you're seeing some change because of Gaza from where I'm sitting. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=716.0s)]
*  I'm seeing a lot more religious crazies coming out of the woodwork because of Gaza. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=720.0s)]
*  We've seen several Israeli officials, top U.S. Christian evangelicals and messianic Jewish rabbis try to spin this war into a religious one, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=724.0s)]
*  with some hoping that it marks the return of the Messiah, others predicting the end of times, Armageddon. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=733.0s)]
*  This talk of some settlers wanting to sacrifice a red heifer to bring about the third temple and the end of the world. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=740.0s)]
*  How do you react to those both in the Holy Land and here in the U.S. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=748.0s)]
*  who are trying to turn the genocide in Gaza, the violence in Gaza, the fighting into a religious conflict, into a holy war? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=752.0s)]
*  I'm sad. I'm troubled. I'm traumatized. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=760.0s)]
*  Because for us, we're talking about real people, friends, relatives who could be killed every day this war goes on. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=763.0s)]
*  Yet we have pastors here who are excited about the end times and even calling for more war. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=771.0s)]
*  It's hard for us to understand this obsession with war and violence among many Christians in this country. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=778.0s)]
*  And honestly, anybody who understands what some of these fundamentalist groups, Christian Zionists, are saying should be shocked that, you know, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=785.0s)]
*  they are friends with Israel to begin with or with Israeli Jews. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=794.0s)]
*  You talk about the end times because in many of these scenarios that they hold, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=797.0s)]
*  Jews will come to Palestine only for two-thirds of them to be massacred and the other third then will be rescued by Jesus when he returns and they will believe in Jesus, you know, convert to Christianity. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=802.0s)]
*  And somehow that's an Israel-friendly theology. It's hard for me to understand how, you know, those are considered friends of Israel. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=813.0s)]
*  But when we speak against occupation, we are called all sorts of things including anti-Semites. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=823.0s)]
*  It's very sad because the conversation should shift, should focus on the sanctity of human lives. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=829.0s)]
*  This is what people of faith should focus on. Human life should be above every consideration. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=839.0s)]
*  Yet rather than caring, how do we stop this war? They justify it and they connect it to end time scenarios. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=845.0s)]
*  They get excited. Whereas to us, it's about real life issues. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=851.0s)]
*  It's about our existence as Palestinians and certainly as Palestinian Christians. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=856.0s)]
*  So these are some of the conversations we're trying to have. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=862.0s)]
*  And as I said, some are beginning to listen and we're asking them for help. Please help us reach out to those. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=864.0s)]
*  I wish they understand the consequences of what they're saying and doing because they give money to Israel. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=870.0s)]
*  Many of these evangelical churches give millions of dollars to Israel. I wish they understand the impact on our daily lives. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=877.0s)]
*  You mentioned apartheid earlier. The A word that gets a lot of people very upset here in the US. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=885.0s)]
*  There's also the G word, genocide. What would you say to someone who says, I don't think it's apartheid, I don't think it's genocide? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=890.0s)]
*  When someone tells me, you know, do you think it's apartheid, I say it's not a matter of opinion. It's not what I think. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=896.0s)]
*  Apartheid has a definition. Does it fit? Do Israeli policies fit? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=903.0s)]
*  And then the second thing I ask, I mean, do we really care about the international law or not? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=910.0s)]
*  Because if we truly care, then what do we do about the reports from Amnesty International to Human Rights Watch to Israel's own B'Tselem? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=915.0s)]
*  I mean, Palestinian lawyers have demonstrated that it is apartheid long before Al-Haq and others. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=924.0s)]
*  I have many South African friends, even evangelical South Africans who come to Palestine and all of them tell us the same thing. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=932.0s)]
*  What you have is worse than apartheid. They say we can smell apartheid for distance. What you have is much worse than apartheid. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=939.0s)]
*  And ironically it's the same people who supported apartheid are now the ones who support Israeli policies. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=946.0s)]
*  And so you ask yourself, did we really learn from history? And the fact that the ICJ case was so quickly dismissed by church leaders and by American government [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=954.0s)]
*  shows you that actually these attitudes of supremacy actually didn't go away. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=965.0s)]
*  You would assume that people would respect what South African theologians, church leaders are saying, at least people in the church. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=972.0s)]
*  But they continue to dismiss, they celebrate someone like Desmond Tutu, the late Archbishop, except when he speaks about Palestine. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=982.0s)]
*  The same way they celebrated Nelson Mandela with the exception of when he spoke about Palestine. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=990.0s)]
*  There's always a Palestine exception. Last question, you have accused Joe Biden of complicity in genocide. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=995.0s)]
*  You've called out the American president saying he's worse, he's a worse Christian Zionist than even American televangelist John Hagee, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1000.0s)]
*  whose extremist and racist rhetoric we've discussed on Zateo in the past. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1007.0s)]
*  You're here in Washington, D.C. right now. We're around the corner from the White House. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1011.0s)]
*  What is the message that you are trying to get across to the president of the United States? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1015.0s)]
*  That, you know, that his policies have directly contributed to a genocide. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1020.0s)]
*  The fact that he says one thing yet continues to provide Israel with the weapons needed to conduct this genocide, make him directly complicit. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1028.0s)]
*  And I think my message is also to many church leaders who continue to focus on the evangelical right while ignoring that we also have a problem in some of the progressive liberal churches. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1038.0s)]
*  Because, as I said, Joe Biden is a self-confessing Zionist, self-confessing Catholic Christian, yet he supported and he continues to defend this genocide. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1051.0s)]
*  Now, sadly, it's too late to reverse the action. What has been done has been done in Gaza. Thousands have been killed. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1063.0s)]
*  But at least we can stop it from going to the West Bank. And at least we make sure those lives were not killed for nothing, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1070.0s)]
*  that something good, I hope, you know, for Palestinians, for the whole region comes out of this. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1077.0s)]
*  So I think as faith leaders, we need to hold politicians accountable. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1083.0s)]
*  And I think it's imperative that we speak with our convictions, our conscience, and speak truth to power. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1088.0s)]
*  And he must hear it from us that we think he has been, his policies, this administration's policy has directly contributed to the killing of thousands of Palestinians, including 15,000 children. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1095.0s)]
*  Sadly, it has. Reverend Munder Isaac, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate you coming in. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1109.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1114.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMuOdDAB4U&t=1115.0s)]
