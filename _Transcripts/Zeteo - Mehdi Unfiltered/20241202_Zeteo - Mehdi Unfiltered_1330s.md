Video Description: What does an end to the war in Ukraine look like? Who will bear the greatest burden when the dust settles? And has the risk of nuclear war increased since the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to strike inside Russia with U.S. missiles?

This episode of "Mehdi Unfiltered" explores these questions as Mehdi Hasan hosts Anatol Lieven, the Eurasia Program Director at the Quincy Institute and author on Russia and Ukraine, and Evelyn Farkas, the Executive Director of the McCain Institute and a former Pentagon official under President Barack Obama.

During the episode, Mehdi asks both guests whether the United States has any credibility in insisting on sanctions against Russia over its occupation of Ukraine, given its ongoing and unconditional support for Israel in Gaza.

The experts also discuss whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is bluffing with his threats to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.

# 'Time Is Not on Ukraine’s Side': Experts Discuss How the War in Ukraine Could End
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [December 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A)
*  Donald Trump made 41 distinct promises for his first day in office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, something light to kick off his term, from cutting funding to schools that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=4.4s)]
*  teach what he thinks is critical race theory, to starting the largest deportation operation [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=8.24s)]
*  in American history, to perhaps his most ambitious promise of all, to end Russia's war on Ukraine [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=12.88s)]
*  in 24 hours. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=19.26s)]
*  Highly unlikely, not only because it's a ludicrous claim, but also because that horrific 33-month [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=21.44s)]
*  war is escalating as we speak. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=26.64s)]
*  Last week, the outgoing Biden administration gave Ukraine permission to use American long-range [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=29.68s)]
*  missiles for attacks inside of Russia for the first time since the Russians invaded [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=33.88s)]
*  in February 2022. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=38.24s)]
*  Vladimir Putin responded by firing a brand new hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=40.08s)]
*  missile into Ukraine. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=44.96s)]
*  He's also believed to have brought in around 10,000 North Korean soldiers who are reportedly [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=47.0s)]
*  stationed on the Russia-Ukraine border, ready to fight on Putin's behalf any day now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=51.68s)]
*  So what chance and end to this war any time soon? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=56.84s)]
*  Earlier this month, for the first time, a narrow majority of Ukrainians said they wanted [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=60.24s)]
*  to see a quick, negotiated end to the conflict. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=64.56s)]
*  So let's debate this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  Is it time to end this war? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  And if so, on whose terms? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=71.12s)]
*  Or should the West be helping the Zelensky government in Ukraine with more military support [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=73.04s)]
*  against an illegal Russian invasion? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=77.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm joined by The Quincy Institute's Eurasia Programme director, Anatole Levin, who has [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=79.12s)]
*  written multiple books on Russia, Ukraine and the Baltics, and the McCain Institute's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=83.6s)]
*  executive director, Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense under [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=87.88s)]
*  President Obama. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=92.56s)]
*  Thank you both for joining me on the show. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=94.08s)]
*  Evelyn, let me start with you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  You've said that you don't believe Joe Biden's latest move with the missiles is escalatory, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  and you even said it should have come a lot sooner. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=103.08s)]
*  But by definition, hasn't it been escalatory? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  Because we've now had Putin fire his own brand new ICBM into Ukraine in response. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=108.82s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, maybe thank you for having me on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  Second, I would say that Putin's the one that's been escalating all along. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=118.66s)]
*  Even that last example that you gave, it's Putin escalating. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=123.13999999999999s)]
*  The reality is we've been providing, as you know, weapons to Ukraine since 2014. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=126.88s)]
*  And yes, we put some rules on the use of those weapons. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=132.74s)]
*  But the reality, it doesn't change the reality that we've been supporting Ukraine indirectly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=135.86s)]
*  in this war with Russia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=141.46s)]
*  So the Biden administration justified the decision to allow the Ukrainians to use long-range [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=143.10000000000002s)]
*  artillery against, frankly, fixed ammunition depots and the like inside of Russia because [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  of the introduction by Vladimir Putin, the escalatory move introducing another country [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  into the war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=161.44000000000003s)]
*  And that is to say North Korea because North Korean troops now are in Russia getting ready [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=162.96s)]
*  or are already attacking Ukrainians. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=167.06s)]
*  And at all, Putin is the one escalating, not Biden. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=170.16s)]
*  Is that an analysis you share? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, they're both escalating. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=173.56s)]
*  That's what a cycle of escalation is. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=175.84s)]
*  One side does one thing and the other does something in response. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=178.12s)]
*  I mean, obviously, the biggest escalation was Putin's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=182.44s)]
*  Now, the Russians did that in response to what they saw as us pushing forward against [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=188.16s)]
*  their vital interests. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=193.48s)]
*  But no, no question, that was the biggest step. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=194.48s)]
*  But Putin did warn that firing missiles into Russia guided, remember, by US intelligence [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=198.4s)]
*  would lead to Russian escalation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=206.28s)]
*  And so it has. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=207.76s)]
*  Although limited Russian escalation, you know, there are many more things they could do. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  He's lowered formally the threshold for Russia's use of nuclear weapons. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=215.84s)]
*  He's now saying he can use nukes in response to a conventional non-nuclear attack on Russia [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=219.16s)]
*  by a country that's supported by nuclear power, which is basically Ukraine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=223.72s)]
*  Evelyn, does that give you pause for thought? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=227.32s)]
*  Does that keep you up at night as a former Pentagon official? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=229.52s)]
*  Well, it always keeps me up at night to hear Vladimir Putin throw around nuclear threats. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=232.44s)]
*  It keeps President Xi of China awake at night. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=237.56s)]
*  And in fact, we know that earlier this year in April, he actually publicly told Putin [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=240.76s)]
*  that he because he said no country should use nuclear threats. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=247.04s)]
*  So he clearly signaled to the Russians, if publicly, if not privately, that that is a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=250.76s)]
*  dangerous road to go down. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  And the reality is there are a lot of reasons why Vladimir Putin is bluffing that he wouldn't [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  use a nuclear weapon out of anger for the first time since World War II. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=261.88s)]
*  It won't change anything for him militarily. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=267.2s)]
*  It will cause incredible political risk and literal fallout for his troops and for his [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=269.76s)]
*  people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=275.2s)]
*  So the idea that he would actually use a nuclear weapon is appalling, but also doesn't seem [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=276.2s)]
*  very practical. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=281.4s)]
*  And we know with Vladimir Putin, each time he's made such a bluff that he would either [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=283.0s)]
*  use nuclear weapons or escalate in some fashion that would be unacceptable to Ukraine or to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=287.3s)]
*  Ukraine's partners, he's actually backed off. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=292.52s)]
*  So we know that he's a bully. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=295.34s)]
*  Can I jump in and say Bob Woodward has a new book out, which I'm sure you've seen, in which [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=297.4s)]
*  he says that back in 2022, Joe Biden's own top intelligence officials were saying privately [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=301.06s)]
*  they believe there was a 50 percent chance that he would use nukes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=306.76s)]
*  Fifty percent is a pretty high probability for the use of a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  Well, I can't comment on what they used to base that intelligence analysis on. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=314.44s)]
*  Perhaps they saw him moving some weaponry. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=320.56s)]
*  But again, I believe that it's less than 50 percent, just based on my study of Vladimir [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=323.64s)]
*  Putin and the intelligence that I've read while I was an official. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  And also the reality that it won't change anything to help him on the battlefield, maybe [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=334.88s)]
*  temporarily. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=341.0s)]
*  But again, the consequences for him would be grave. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  Anatole, do you agree with that, the analysis on the nuke risk? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=346.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, the CIA had that analysis in the autumn of 22, because at that time it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=349.44s)]
*  looked as if Russia was actually losing very badly and might lose key positions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=357.24s)]
*  You remember that was when the Ukrainians drove Russia out of Kharkov province, forced [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=363.0s)]
*  the Russians to withdraw from Kherson. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=367.76s)]
*  And I think it's always been very clear that Putin is not going to use nuclear weapons [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=370.46s)]
*  in order to win. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=376.84s)]
*  He's going to use them if it ever looks as if he's going to lose. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=379.0s)]
*  Now the only way now that he's going to lose is if NATO intervenes directly, you know, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=383.92s)]
*  sends aircraft or an army to Ukraine. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=388.96s)]
*  Very unlikely. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=391.96s)]
*  Especially under a Trump presidency, which is around the corner. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=392.96s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=396.4s)]
*  Though, you know, the French and the Poles have sometimes suggested that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=397.4s)]
*  But that's what this bluster is intended to deter. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=400.68s)]
*  And that's why the CIA had the analysis that it did in the autumn of 22. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=407.04s)]
*  How much does the ATTACAMs, these missiles that the Americans have given the Ukrainians [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=411.8s)]
*  or allowed them to use to strike inside of Russia, how much does that increase the nuclear [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  risk in your view at all? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=419.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, obviously, if you have US intelligence guiding American-made missiles to their targets [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=421.48s)]
*  inside Russia, I mean, I'm old enough to remember the Cold War. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=429.0s)]
*  This would have been seen as a nightmarish threat. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=433.02000000000004s)]
*  But they don't critically change the military balance on the ground. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=437.92s)]
*  I mean, what worries the Russians is that if they let this red line be passed, you know, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=443.3s)]
*  NATO might go further and further until the point where there really might be a direct [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=448.22s)]
*  war. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=452.70000000000005s)]
*  Evelyn, Anatole says the NATO intervention angle is what would really raise the stakes [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=453.70000000000005s)]
*  here, which he says is unlikely. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=459.26s)]
*  Interestingly, you wrote in an op-ed that Joe Biden should actually push to expedite [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine's invitation into NATO. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=465.78s)]
*  And you write, without the prospect of a NATO security umbrella, Ukraine will be another [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=467.98s)]
*  kind of duck, a sitting duck in Vladimir Putin's sights. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=472.9s)]
*  I wonder, Evelyn, number one, Trump's never going to agree to that. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=476.38s)]
*  Number two, a lot of European countries aren't going to side onto that. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=479.5s)]
*  But number three, wouldn't that vindicate Russia's original quote unquote justification [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=482.06s)]
*  for invading Ukraine, which is NATO's out to get us? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=487.14s)]
*  OK, so there are a couple of questions there. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=490.3s)]
*  First of all, with regard to the NATO allies, as recently as a couple of months ago, they [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=493.78s)]
*  were all aligned actually in favor. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=500.53999999999996s)]
*  And it was our government that still wasn't prepared to allow Ukraine into NATO. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=503.17999999999995s)]
*  Of course, under any scenario, they probably were going to wait until after the elections. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=508.46s)]
*  Now you're right with President Trump coming into office. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=513.62s)]
*  It's not likely that he would agree to a security guarantee in the form of a NATO membership [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=517.22s)]
*  guarantee. However, I can't rule it out entirely because if President Trump really wants a [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=522.86s)]
*  peace deal, the only peace deal that's going to hold while Vladimir Putin is in the Kremlin [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  in the eyes of the Ukrainians and in the eyes of most of the Russia-Ukraine analysts and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=532.46s)]
*  experts that I know is one that includes a security guarantee for Ukraine that Vladimir [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=537.1400000000001s)]
*  Putin, again, assuming he's still in office, that he won't view any peace deal as a ceasefire [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=542.58s)]
*  and attack later. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=547.94s)]
*  So something needs to be given to Ukraine that is a real guarantee that requires Senate [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  ratification, which ironically, President Biden can't get that probably, but President [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=555.5400000000001s)]
*  Trump could. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=560.46s)]
*  So I don't rule it out entirely, maybe if he ends up realizing, he being President Trump, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=561.46s)]
*  that the only way to peace is to convince Vladimir Putin that Ukraine must have the [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=567.4200000000001s)]
*  security guarantee, he might be willing to give it to Ukraine. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=574.7s)]
*  But Putin would have to be much weakened and willing to make peace. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=578.26s)]
*  Anatoly, you've previously written that members of the Russian establishment have suggested [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=582.26s)]
*  to you and others the possibility that in return for a treaty of neutrality, excluding [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=585.46s)]
*  NATO membership, Russia would give up its further territorial ambitions and this war [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=589.7s)]
*  as whole. But doesn't Evelyn make a good point that there's no end to a war that doesn't [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=593.7s)]
*  come with some sort of security guarantee to the Ukrainians who've been through hell [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=598.34s)]
*  for the past couple of years? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=601.58s)]
*  Yes, but I mean, NATO is not a viable or convincing security guarantee. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=603.26s)]
*  All our governments, including Biden's, have said repeatedly, we will not go to war to [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  defend Ukraine. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=615.26s)]
*  Now, at that point, what is this NATO guarantee? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=616.26s)]
*  It's empty. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=620.18s)]
*  But also, there's been this narrative in the West that, you know, if Putin quote unquote [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  Ukraine, the next thing he will do is, if not directly attack NATO, test NATO, you know, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=628.58s)]
*  through some form of aggression against the Baltic States. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  Look, if Putin wants to test NATO, he will do so in Ukraine. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=637.0200000000001s)]
*  If NATO does take Ukraine in, that's where he will do it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=642.7800000000001s)]
*  And what I don't understand is that, quite rightly, Article 5 is regarded as critical [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=647.38s)]
*  to the security of Europe. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=655.54s)]
*  It's an absolute, you know... [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=656.9399999999999s)]
*  This is a mutual security pact? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=658.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=659.9s)]
*  But by extending it to a country that we've already said that we won't defend, we are [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=660.9s)]
*  not strengthening the effect of Article 5. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=665.26s)]
*  We are disastrously weakening it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=668.62s)]
*  Evelyn, fair point there from our side. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=670.9799999999999s)]
*  I mean, your former boss, President Obama, was one of the first who said at the time, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=672.38s)]
*  look, we're never going to fight for Ukraine in the way that Putin's going to fight against [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=675.42s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=678.9799999999999s)]
*  It's a bigger interest for him than for us. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=679.98s)]
*  Things have changed. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=682.5s)]
*  As I mentioned, very recently, the Europeans were lined up and it was our government behind [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=683.5s)]
*  the scenes that was not yet ready to, you know, give the green light to Ukraine becoming [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=689.5s)]
*  a member. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=695.34s)]
*  The Europeans have become increasingly alarmed at what Russia is doing in terms of sabotage [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=696.34s)]
*  operations on European territory to test NATO's resolve. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=701.86s)]
*  And Article 5 is deadly serious. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=706.74s)]
*  The Europeans do not want to go to war with Russia. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=708.98s)]
*  They much prefer to have Ukraine essentially brought to a peaceful... [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=711.94s)]
*  But, Evelyn, forget Europeans for a moment. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=716.1800000000001s)]
*  Americans don't even want to send weapons to Ukraine right now, according to the latest [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=718.22s)]
*  polling. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=721.62s)]
*  They surely don't want to go to war for Ukraine. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=722.62s)]
*  And by the way, the Europeans are not lined up. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=725.1400000000001s)]
*  The Hungarians are against. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=727.22s)]
*  Opposition parties throughout Europe are against. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=729.58s)]
*  The Turks are against. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=732.5s)]
*  All right, well, let's part the Europeans for a moment and just deal with the Americans [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=733.5s)]
*  here because we've got Trump coming in. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=736.7800000000001s)]
*  With or without Trump, the American public doesn't want to go to war for Ukraine. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=738.2600000000001s)]
*  Rightly or wrongly, Evelyn? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=742.78s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=743.78s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=744.78s)]
*  The problem is that, again, I do believe we have to take Vladimir Putin at his word. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=745.78s)]
*  Everything he said he would do, he has done. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=751.1800000000001s)]
*  So he has said that he would like to recreate the Soviet Union. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=753.34s)]
*  The Baltic states, which are members of NATO, were part of the Soviet Union. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=757.26s)]
*  We know that Putin wants to recreate the neo-imperial Soviet Russian empire. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=761.46s)]
*  And we need to deter him. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=767.38s)]
*  The best way to deter him is to be strong, to stand up to him. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=769.7s)]
*  Otherwise, we're in a much dangerous scenario. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=773.62s)]
*  Isn't there a bit of a contradiction there, Evelyn? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=775.5s)]
*  You're saying we need to take him at his word when it comes to his expansionist aims. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=777.58s)]
*  But when he says he might use nuclear weapons, you say we shouldn't take him at his word. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=780.7800000000001s)]
*  He's just bluffing. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=784.0600000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=785.0600000000001s)]
*  There's a contradiction there. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=786.0600000000001s)]
*  But he's a bully and he needs to be deterred from taking further military action against [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=787.46s)]
*  NATO. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=793.82s)]
*  And frankly, the best way to do that is to show him that we mean what we say, that we'll [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=794.82s)]
*  back Ukraine up, that his aggressive foreign policy cannot prevail. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=798.98s)]
*  He's broken international law and order, frankly. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=803.4200000000001s)]
*  And we need to re-establish the system that we put in place after World War II, which [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=807.5s)]
*  has kept us all out of a world war. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=812.7s)]
*  But by introducing, by invading Ukraine in 2014 and seizing Crimea, the first annexation [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=815.32s)]
*  since Hitler did it in Austria, and then now introducing the North Koreans and working [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=821.46s)]
*  with Iran and China, the Russians have set up a really dangerous scenario for us. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=826.5s)]
*  Anatole, the North Koreans. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=832.58s)]
*  Come on. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=834.02s)]
*  Putin is bringing North Korean troops to use against a European country. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=835.02s)]
*  He's made genocidal threats in the past. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=838.5s)]
*  No, he hasn't. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=840.34s)]
*  He's denied the existence of Ukraine. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=841.34s)]
*  Come on. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=842.34s)]
*  If you say Ukraine doesn't exist in the country, is that not different? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=843.34s)]
*  No, maybe. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=846.46s)]
*  Look, he said that the Ukrainians and the Russians are, you know, closely linked peoples. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=847.46s)]
*  If you deny the existence of a neighbouring country, is that not a little bit genocide? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=851.98s)]
*  Look, what Israel is doing is genocide. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=857.3399999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=858.8199999999999s)]
*  You don't have to get me on that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=859.8199999999999s)]
*  And Israelis also say Palestinians don't exist. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=860.8199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=862.78s)]
*  But they're doing something about it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=863.78s)]
*  All right. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=865.14s)]
*  Well, let's park the debate about how genocidal Putin is. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=866.14s)]
*  North Korean troops. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=867.9799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, that is certainly... [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=868.9799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's... [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=869.9799999999999s)]
*  What is the West supposed to do? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=871.2199999999999s)]
*  Turn a blind eye to that? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=872.2199999999999s)]
*  I wonder, are there some on the anti-war side, you know, the pro-negotiation, who are a little [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=873.2199999999999s)]
*  bit naive about Putin's intent? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=877.38s)]
*  Well, look, first, we have to actually... [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=879.3399999999999s)]
*  Remember, none of these North Koreans have actually been produced for us yet. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=882.82s)]
*  Now, if they are, I'll believe it, but we haven't seen them in action yet. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=886.78s)]
*  I mean, there's also talk now of Yemeni mercenaries being brought in as well. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=891.18s)]
*  Lots of reporting. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=894.62s)]
*  Mm-hm, perhaps. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=895.62s)]
*  But it's...of course, this is an escalation, no question. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=896.62s)]
*  But if it's true, what it also demonstrates is that the Russians themselves are short [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=901.46s)]
*  of troops. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=908.66s)]
*  And one key reason for that is that Putin, as Russian hardliners, by the way, repeatedly [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=910.42s)]
*  attack him for, is that Putin has only mobilised a fraction of Russia's reserves. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=915.66s)]
*  That's because he knows that, you know, he has gained the support of the population and [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=922.5799999999999s)]
*  the recruits themselves by paying them enormous amounts of money. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=927.74s)]
*  Now, you can do that with 500,000 troops. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=930.42s)]
*  You can't do it with 5 million. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=932.9s)]
*  So, the Russians...so, actually, this is not still a country fully mobilised for war. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=935.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, that doesn't... [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=942.0600000000001s)]
*  And you believe that gives people an opportunity to do a deal? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, the point is that Putin is not prepared to go the, you know, the full distance [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=948.22s)]
*  that he would need to go if he was actually aiming to win a complete victory. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=955.5s)]
*  Now, it may be that the terms set by Russia will be completely unacceptable. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=961.54s)]
*  It could be that the terms set by us are completely unacceptable. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=968.5s)]
*  But we won't know that until we have started negotiations. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=971.62s)]
*  So, Donald Trump says he wants to start negotiations. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=975.42s)]
*  Republicans, Evelyn, have said for a while, you know, we need to do a deal, we need to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=978.54s)]
*  end this war. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=982.9s)]
*  A lot of, kind of, MAGA Republicans have said, you know, Ukraine should just accept that [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=983.9s)]
*  they're not going to get a bunch of territory back. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=989.18s)]
*  And what Democrats have said for a long time and other liberals who support Ukraine have [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=991.2199999999999s)]
*  said you cannot throw the Ukrainian people under the bus. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=995.42s)]
*  The Ukrainians want to fight, the Ukrainians don't want to give up their land, we should [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=998.2199999999999s)]
*  support them, which is a valid position. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1001.6999999999999s)]
*  But what do you do when you have a Gallup poll, as you do this month, which for the [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1004.2199999999999s)]
*  first time shows that even a majority of Ukrainians say they want a quick negotiated end to the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1007.38s)]
*  conflict, and 52% of Ukrainians say they are resigned to the fact that they're going to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1012.26s)]
*  have to give up territory as part of that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1016.5799999999999s)]
*  That's where the Ukrainians are now. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1018.4599999999999s)]
*  So are you kind of, you know, are the Democrats almost ahead of where the Ukrainian people [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1019.9s)]
*  are now? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1023.8199999999999s)]
*  No, I was just in Ukraine almost two weeks ago now, I came back right before our elections. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1024.82s)]
*  And you're right, the Ukrainians are tired, they would like a deal. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1032.34s)]
*  They don't want a deal, though, that is unjust. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1037.54s)]
*  But I think they would be willing to swap some of their territory in exchange for a [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1040.34s)]
*  real security guarantee, the knowledge that no other future Russian government and certainly [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1045.1799999999998s)]
*  not a government where Vladimir Putin is still in the Kremlin would ever attack them and [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1050.3799999999999s)]
*  try to erase them, erase their sovereignty, erase their ethnic background, their history. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1054.86s)]
*  So I think there is the kernel of a deal there. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1059.82s)]
*  But Vladimir Putin and the elites around him would have to be convinced that that time [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1064.1399999999999s)]
*  is not on their side. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1069.02s)]
*  And that's where I think Donald Trump could actually play a constructive role. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1070.1s)]
*  I bet you never thought you'd be saying that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1074.9399999999998s)]
*  I know. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1076.6999999999998s)]
*  One last question to both of you, one last topic relatedly. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1077.6999999999998s)]
*  Evelyn, you believe that one of the ways the US should, quote, punish Russia is by slapping [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1081.26s)]
*  secondary sanctions on countries providing electronics, machine tools and other precursors [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1085.74s)]
*  that are being used to manufacture drones and other weapons in Russia, you say. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1090.2199999999998s)]
*  Isn't it difficult for the United States today to take a moral position on Russia, to talk [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1093.9799999999998s)]
*  about punishing Russia for undeniable war crimes in Ukraine, given the US is also simultaneously [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1100.3s)]
*  funding and arming what Israel is doing in Gaza, war crimes, crimes against humanity [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1106.94s)]
*  in the eyes of many a genocide? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1111.42s)]
*  Many would argue that what Israel is doing in Gaza is worse than what Russia has done [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1113.26s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1117.26s)]
*  So the US is left in a very strange position where it condemns one but not the other. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1118.26s)]
*  Well it's not an excuse not to support US policy views of Ukraine. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1123.26s)]
*  But I'm talking about credibility, not whether you support it or not. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1128.62s)]
*  I understand what you're saying, Mitty. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1132.4599999999998s)]
*  It does hurt our credibility to be supporting Israel without putting some conditions or [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1133.82s)]
*  influence on the way that they are fighting. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1143.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're fighting Hamas, but they, as we know, are killing civilians needlessly [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1146.5s)]
*  and they're not prioritizing getting back their own hostages. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1152.9799999999998s)]
*  So yes, it does throw some, it does cause credibility issues, but I think if you are [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1156.22s)]
*  addressing each policy separately, you just say to yourself, what is the right thing to [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1165.22s)]
*  do in each scenario? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1169.9s)]
*  And you can't give a pass to, you can't say, oh well, because the United States policy [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1171.58s)]
*  in Gaza or vis-a-vis the Palestinian people is, I don't believe in it or it's immoral, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1177.02s)]
*  therefore I don't support what people are proposing in Ukraine. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1184.14s)]
*  You need to look at each on its merits and see whether it aligns with US interests and values. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1187.74s)]
*  Anatole, has Gaza affected America's ability to get support for its position on Ukraine? [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1193.5800000000002s)]
*  This is technically called hypocrisy, you know, and that is how it is seen in the rest [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1200.0200000000002s)]
*  of the world. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1204.5400000000002s)]
*  And America cannot ask countries to go against their own interests in the name of appealing [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1206.5400000000002s)]
*  to morality while doing what it is doing with Israel. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1211.66s)]
*  There is simply no moral or legal basis for this. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1215.5800000000002s)]
*  And of course the thing is, you know, the West is concentrating on Chinese supplies [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1218.8200000000002s)]
*  to Russia, which is really what Evelyn has been talking about. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1223.74s)]
*  But actually a great many of these imports go into Russia via US partners in the Gulf, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1228.5400000000002s)]
*  via the UAE, via the Caucasus, via India. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1236.0600000000002s)]
*  You start trying to bring secondary sanctions to bear on India, you're going to have a problem. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1240.9s)]
*  The Indians do not like being bullied in this way and also we're not going to do it, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1245.3000000000002s)]
*  which once again leads to the whole hypocrisy business. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1249.14s)]
*  No, I mean, let us explore the possibility of peace, which by the way the huge majority [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1253.3400000000001s)]
*  of the international community wants. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1262.14s)]
*  They want a peace deal in Ukraine and see if it's possible. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1266.18s)]
*  But I think a point to be made about that is that the Ukrainians are absolutely opposed [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1271.22s)]
*  to giving up any more land as part of a peace deal. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1277.74s)]
*  But increasingly they are recognizing that as the war goes on it's impossible to recover [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1282.66s)]
*  the land that they've lost. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1287.9s)]
*  And the longer that the war goes on, of course, the more land they are actually losing. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1289.22s)]
*  So the other point to be made is time is not on Ukraine's side. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1294.1599999999999s)]
*  The deal we get today may be a lot better when Trump comes to power than a deal we would [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1299.6399999999999s)]
*  get in a year's time. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1305.2399999999998s)]
*  Or a year ago, we will never know. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1306.2399999999998s)]
*  Thank you both, Evelyn Farkas, Anatole Levin. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1308.58s)]
*  Appreciate you both for your time and for your analysis. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1310.4399999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1312.6s)]
*  Your support matters. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLvTRJyz9A&t=1324.12s)]
