Video Description: “We are governed by morons, and we are in an episode of ‘Idiocracy.’”

Mehdi Hasan was joined in New York for a fascinating, fun, and wide-ranging conversation by Molly Jong-Fast, acclaimed author, host of the ‘Fast Politics’ podcast, and a special correspondent for Vanity Fair.

Mehdi and Molly unleash on the idiocy of the Trump tariffs - and the Donald Trump administration in general.

“I feel that the thing that got us the most furious was the stupid, right?” responds Molly. “I mean, I'm offended by the racism, I'm offended by the xenophobia, but the thing that keeps me up at night is the moronics. Like, none of this works, right? The math on this does not work.”

# Mehdi and Molly UNLEASH on Trump, Tariffs, and Terrible People
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc)
*  So the Trump administration gets crazier and crazier by the day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=0.0s)]
*  Who better talk to about all the craziness than my good friend, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=3.2s)]
*  Molly Jung, fast, who is the host of the Fast Politics podcast. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=6.12s)]
*  It's a special correspondent of Vanity Fair. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=9.32s)]
*  Well, you and I have talked many times, but never in person. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=11.08s)]
*  I think the first time we're talking in person. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=14.32s)]
*  Well, we've met before. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=15.92s)]
*  None of it. We know that interview. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=17.28s)]
*  I think when I was at MSNBC, you were remote when I've been on your podcast. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=18.52s)]
*  We've been on. Yes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=22.28s)]
*  It's great to see you in person here in New York. Yes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=23.28s)]
*  You and I first came across you almost a decade ago. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=26.28s)]
*  I moved to the US exactly a decade ago. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=29.2s)]
*  And a couple of years later, you were singing my praises on social media. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=31.68s)]
*  And obviously, the modest man that I am, I love people who sing my praises. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=36.32s)]
*  And you were telling people he should be hired by MSNBC. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=39.64s)]
*  And this is when I was at Al Jazeera. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=42.04s)]
*  I'd only been there a couple of years and we got to talk. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=43.56s)]
*  I think we met in D.C. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=45.44s)]
*  And I was like, well, Molly Jung fast, that name sounds familiar. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=47.16s)]
*  And I heard of your mother. Yeah. Famous novelist. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=49.92s)]
*  And I was like, but why is she so into politics? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  Had you just got into politics then? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  Were you always very political? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=56.92s)]
*  You're now one of like people know you as this great political commentator. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=58.04s)]
*  I started writing about politics [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=61.12s)]
*  about 12ish years ago. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=64.68s)]
*  And I started I mean, I kind of remade my career because I had all these children [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=67.4s)]
*  and it really derailed me. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=72.16s)]
*  I love them. Don't get me wrong. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=74.0s)]
*  But I love them. But they derailed me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=75.64s)]
*  In case you're wondering, if once you when you have three children, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=77.72s)]
*  you kind of derail your career, which is fine. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I you know, I had a working mother who was always like, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=84.12s)]
*  you can have it all. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=87.24s)]
*  And I was like, I haven't seen you in like 10 years. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=88.32s)]
*  So if we I did not have it all. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=90.8s)]
*  And but then I sort of came back and I started writing these columns for the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=93.8s)]
*  for this newspaper that I had written for when I was 13. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=97.76s)]
*  And and and I started writing for them the forward. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=101.36s)]
*  And then from there, I started writing columns for better and better places. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=105.72s)]
*  Kept calling me and I sort of, you know, and and and now I'm at Fanny Faire, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=109.32s)]
*  which is a delightful place to call home. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=113.76s)]
*  And I feel like you and I also bonded because we were both [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=115.88s)]
*  outraged by the rise of Trump and not just the rise of Trump, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=120.0s)]
*  but by the normalization of Trump. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we've both been media critics for quite a long time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=125.24s)]
*  Well, I also think, you know, you come from this Oxford style, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=127.64s)]
*  which is very intellectual. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=131.8s)]
*  And it's a lot about, you know, you interview people. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=134.32s)]
*  The reason why you're I think of like Isaac Chotner at the New Yorkers, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=136.96s)]
*  another person who does that where great interview. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=140.96s)]
*  You never want to be interviewed by him, though. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=143.2s)]
*  Totally. He calls you put the phone down. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=145.28s)]
*  Right. You just change your name. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=147.16s)]
*  Change your number. Yeah. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=149.6s)]
*  Like, right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=151.08s)]
*  And but the same is you can you are capable of that style of interview. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=152.08s)]
*  I am not. And I'm in awe of it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=156.32s)]
*  Like, I've seen you interview people from the first Trump administration [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=159.16s)]
*  before they just decided they weren't going to ever engage with the media [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=163.6s)]
*  in any way that wasn't totally North Korea. Yes. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=167.2s)]
*  And and it would and you just were able to sort of you would have the research. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=170.08s)]
*  You had the research. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  So you were like, well, you know, on October 3rd, you said, you know, that we [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  and and and that works so well with this administration because these people have [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  all I mean, the great example is like Marco Rubio. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  There's a video today of him saying like terrorists are the dumbest thing ever [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=188.76s)]
*  known to man. At least the phony. Right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=192.6s)]
*  I mean, yeah. So it's very easy. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=194.84s)]
*  It's not as easy, but it's also just very brave [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  to be able to remind them of things they've said. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  How do you think the media is doing in the Trump second term [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=202.84s)]
*  compared to the first time you were seeing the Washington post with Bezos? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=206.12s)]
*  Bezos is rolling over. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  You're seeing ABC News settle ridiculous lawsuits. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  CBS News may be about to settle another ridiculous lawsuit with Trump. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=213.36s)]
*  What do you make of media coverage? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=217.24s)]
*  I mean, I think the big problem with the media coverage [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  is that the industry is in such turmoil [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=221.52s)]
*  that it's almost like the coverage is secondary. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=225.36s)]
*  So, for example, in 2016, the question was, should we platform Donald Trump? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=228.92s)]
*  Should we put him on cable news? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=234.32s)]
*  Now it's 2024. It doesn't matter. Right. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=236.04s)]
*  Like they don't. Donald Trump doesn't need cable news because he can just go on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=239.2s)]
*  Joe Rogan for seven hours. He can just go on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=243.44s)]
*  You know, he can just hold up his own phone [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=245.96s)]
*  and do a little like live video and that's it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=249.28s)]
*  So so it's it shows the sort of diminished state of the media. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=252.6s)]
*  But yes, the media has not. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=255.92s)]
*  Look, there's no playbook for covering authoritarian, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=257.68s)]
*  the rise of authoritarianism in a free and fair democracy. Right. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=260.44s)]
*  There's no playbook for that. Right. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=263.88s)]
*  But they haven't even tried to create one. That's the problem. Right. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=265.92s)]
*  It's not that there's no play. Right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=268.04s)]
*  It's that you have to first accept that we are in an authoritarian country. Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  I think a lot of journalists don't want to do that. Right. Right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=273.56s)]
*  There's still a reluctance from, quote unquote, mainstream. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=275.8s)]
*  What do you want to call it? Centrist establishment, whatever word you want to use [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=279.32s)]
*  who just don't want to accept that we are living in a different world. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  This is not just a temporary blip. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=285.44s)]
*  This is America. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=286.88s)]
*  Well, I would say this. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=287.76s)]
*  He's got a serious authoritarian leanings. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=289.48s)]
*  Even his staunchest supporters would say that. Right. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=292.88s)]
*  They would just love it. Right. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=295.92s)]
*  It's the brand now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=298.08s)]
*  But I but I think we still have a lot of the we're in that squishy, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=299.84s)]
*  scary period where we still have room to to rescue the country [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=304.68s)]
*  from this authoritarian push. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=310.52s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of people in this country, as we've seen [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=313.36s)]
*  through the polls, as we've seen in that Wisconsin [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=316.88s)]
*  judicial election, there are many, many people in this country [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=321.24s)]
*  do not want to live in Hungary. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=324.76s)]
*  And that's the good news. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=326.92s)]
*  Who are the Democrats in your view who are going to rescue the country? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=328.76s)]
*  Independent journalism. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=347.32s)]
*  So, again, this is a really you're so mean. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=348.56s)]
*  You're like, who are the Democrats? Name them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=352.64s)]
*  And it name rank them. OK. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=354.56s)]
*  Yeah. So the good framing comes from Pritzker's office. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=356.4s)]
*  OK. Governor Pritzker. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=362.12s)]
*  Yeah. Governor of Illinois. Really good framing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=364.0s)]
*  His chief of staff is like one of the most talented speechwriters. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=366.92s)]
*  She says it's not left versus center left versus, you know, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=371.0s)]
*  whatever center center fight versus cave. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=375.92s)]
*  Some of us have been saying for a long time. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=378.56s)]
*  Right. 100 percent agree. Fight versus cave. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=380.0s)]
*  So the question is, who are the people who are holding town halls [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=382.04s)]
*  in Republican districts and who are not? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=386.12s)]
*  And I interviewed Maxwell Frost today, young member of Congress, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=388.68s)]
*  a little more lefty, but from Florida. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=392.44s)]
*  And, you know, wrong with being a little bit left. Right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=395.12s)]
*  No, no. Listen, but I'm just. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=396.96000000000004s)]
*  But the point was he did a town hall with Chris Murphy, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=399.28000000000003s)]
*  a little more century, but together, you know, Murphy's been [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=404.08000000000004s)]
*  beating the drum like you can't fucking believe. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=407.8s)]
*  And and so has and so has Maxwell. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=410.6s)]
*  They did a town hall together in a Republican district [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=413.72s)]
*  where the Republican wouldn't do a town hall. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=416.16s)]
*  I think what he told me today that [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=418.32s)]
*  that Republicans came to him and were like, that's actually really brave. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=422.84000000000003s)]
*  We haven't seen Democrats do that. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=426.36s)]
*  Interesting. I'm glad that progressives are stepping up on this and leading the way. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=428.36s)]
*  You've got Bernie and AOC. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. Huge rallies. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=433.56s)]
*  Greg Casar, who's the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus from Austin, Texas. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=435.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. He went to Chip Roy's district, one of the most odious Republican [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=438.8s)]
*  members of Congress, and he took a cardboard cut out of Chip Roy, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  which he put behind him, which I thought was funny. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=445.36s)]
*  Yeah. The guy can't too scared to do his own town halls. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=446.76s)]
*  Ro Khanna has been to Kevin McCarthy's backyard. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=450.0s)]
*  And you're right. It's not about left versus right. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=453.48s)]
*  I always give this example. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  Eric Swalwell is not someone whose politics I 100 percent share. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=456.68s)]
*  No, I'm way to the left of Eric Swalwell. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=460.12s)]
*  What I've always liked about Swalwell is he's always up for a fight. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=462.20000000000005s)]
*  He's always willing to call out the Republicans, do a powerful ad, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  have a funny, snarky one-liner on Twitter. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=468.16s)]
*  We need a bit of that. Right. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=470.24s)]
*  Just to keep people going, even if there's no overarching, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=472.16s)]
*  great grand plan or strategy. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  And that is and we see it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=476.68s)]
*  Look, we see it with Jasmine Crockett. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=478.48s)]
*  We see it with, you know, there are a lot of members who are [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=480.8s)]
*  who are ambitious and young. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=484.48s)]
*  They're not leaders. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=486.76s)]
*  They're not. It's not Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=487.68s)]
*  Well, so this again, I was. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=489.92s)]
*  They know this because I said this to them, but I was really deeply [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=494.4s)]
*  disappointed with the elevation of [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=500.36s)]
*  the with the refusal to put AOC as ranking member of oversight. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=504.96s)]
*  Instead of they went with Jerry Connolly, Jerry Connolly, 76 years old, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  has throat cancer is and you know, the and he and somebody said [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=513.96s)]
*  he's fighting Irish. No, no, honey. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=519.4s)]
*  Like the problem, the fundamental problem with Democrats, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=521.9599999999999s)]
*  and this is not all of them, but with the older generation [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=525.48s)]
*  is they can't get online. They can't do a sub stack. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=529.24s)]
*  They can't, you know, they can't do a little sub stack video. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=531.84s)]
*  And that I actually I think is definitely an older issue. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=535.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's not just an older issue. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=537.84s)]
*  I think it's also a mindset issue. Right. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=539.16s)]
*  For example, Hakeem Jeffries is a younger Democrat. Right. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=541.6s)]
*  But when he's asked, you know, what would you say about Donald Trump? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=543.88s)]
*  He says, I think he's captain chaos. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=545.88s)]
*  Really, really? OK. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=548.04s)]
*  Ten years in. So this is what you've got on Trump. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Captain chaos as someone who texted his office and was like, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=552.0s)]
*  Captain Chaos. Really? Sounds like a serial. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=556.36s)]
*  Well, I did. I texted them and I was like, really? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=558.68s)]
*  You can't do better than Captain Chaos. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=561.96s)]
*  Like we're 10 years into Trump. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=564.36s)]
*  Well, I said he's not Captain Chaos. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=565.92s)]
*  Like he's captain, like ruin the economy and push authoritarianism. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=567.96s)]
*  Don't call him captain. Right. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=572.04s)]
*  Like it's a title of respect and reverence. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=573.72s)]
*  It's Captain America. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=576.08s)]
*  So, yes, he's getting again. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm not there's mistakes are happening along the way, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=580.48s)]
*  but we're seeing more out of that office and we're seeing better [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  and little videos and they're trying. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=589.0s)]
*  And Chris Murphy has been leading the way. Right. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=591.0s)]
*  Actually, Murphy had a very good line, which, again, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=592.72s)]
*  I think is important for us to remember. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=594.72s)]
*  Everyone talk about tariffs, the economy, the tariffs, the economy. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=596.12s)]
*  He came out and made a very good point, very powerful thread, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=598.9200000000001s)]
*  which more people need to share, which is this is not just about the economy. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  This is yet again, an abuse of power by Trump. Right. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=604.4s)]
*  And it's a it's a form of leverage over his opponent. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  And he's going to use it to enrich himself and to allow his donors. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=609.76s)]
*  You know, it's going to be a test of loyalty. Right. Right. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=613.48s)]
*  If you follow me, you can have a cut out. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=615.28s)]
*  You can have a cut out. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=617.32s)]
*  You can have already oil and gas have got their car back. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=617.96s)]
*  They did the deal before the election. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=620.16s)]
*  I mean, the the message in this administration, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=622.0s)]
*  which is so clear, is like, get the right lobbyists. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=625.48s)]
*  Like, remember the TikTok ban? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=628.4s)]
*  They were going to ban TikTok. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=630.16s)]
*  TikTok went and got lobbyists now. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=631.48s)]
*  And then praise Trump. Don't forget a little praise. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=633.48s)]
*  Thank you, President Trump. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=635.12s)]
*  I mean, this is the administration of lobbyists. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=636.28s)]
*  Suzy Wiles, the chief of staff was a lobbyist. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=637.76s)]
*  Duffy at Transport was a lobbyist. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=639.88s)]
*  No, no. Bondi was a lobbyist. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=641.88s)]
*  Lobby is a drain the swamp. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=643.6800000000001s)]
*  See, only way these people can make money. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=646.04s)]
*  Yeah, because they have no other talent. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=648.76s)]
*  Well, that that takes me to something else I wanted to talk to you about. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=650.0s)]
*  A lot of people talk about 4D chess, 3D chess, whatever the freaking phrase is. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=654.84s)]
*  Is it easier to analyze what the Trump administration does [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=659.48s)]
*  by simply starting from the premise that we are governed by morons [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  and we are an episode of idiocracy? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=664.92s)]
*  So I feel that the thing that got us the most furious was the stupid. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=666.52s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Like, I don't. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=670.56s)]
*  Right. I mean, I'm offended by the racism. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm offended by the xenophobia. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=675.04s)]
*  But the thing that keeps me up at night is the moronics. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. Like, it's just like you just none of this works. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=681.04s)]
*  Right. The math on this does not work. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=684.52s)]
*  You're going to, you know, you're going to tariff an island full of penguins. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=686.64s)]
*  Right. And then and the tax. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=689.48s)]
*  And then we won't need to have income tax anymore. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=691.64s)]
*  I mean, did you see Lutner saying on CNN, the Commerce Secretary, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=693.96s)]
*  our beef is strong and beautiful. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=697.4s)]
*  Theirs is weak. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=699.6s)]
*  Was that even me? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=701.0s)]
*  The world in which Lutnik is in there. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=702.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that guy, by the way, he is like the Scaramucci of this. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=704.28s)]
*  You know, he's on television all the time. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=708.16s)]
*  Eventually, he's very North Korean sycophant. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=710.24s)]
*  Yes. And eventually he's going to get fired and write the book that is, you know, that [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=712.48s)]
*  and then he's going to be like Michael Cohen, like a never Trump. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=717.24s)]
*  For sure. 100 percent. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=719.8s)]
*  I already plotted out. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=721.56s)]
*  I saw this coming from a mile away. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=722.64s)]
*  You heard it here from Barley Juggfars. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=725.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I could be it could be wrong. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=726.5999999999999s)]
*  It could not be Lutnik. But does he go before Musk? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=728.5999999999999s)]
*  I think I think Trump will hold on to Musk because he has so much money. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=732.3599999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, he has that platform of Twitter. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=736.12s)]
*  Yeah. And he has to intimidate the party. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=738.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. If he turned that against them. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=739.92s)]
*  Right. I mean, I think it's a question of how much pain [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=741.68s)]
*  Musk will take with his stock prices. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=745.12s)]
*  Right. Because and the steel. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=747.68s)]
*  He's getting hurt by tariffs, too. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=749.44s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he'll have a tariff thing is so insane [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=750.48s)]
*  that when you try and understand what they're doing, you know, is it economic nationalism? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=753.2800000000001s)]
*  Is it just Trump being a petty tyrant? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=757.4000000000001s)]
*  Is it idiocy and ignorance about basic economics, which definitely is part of it? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=759.84s)]
*  He doesn't even understand the difference between trade deficit and what a tariff is. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=764.48s)]
*  In fact, people forget this. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=767.84s)]
*  But in his first time, he confused the trade deficit with a budget deficit. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=769.2800000000001s)]
*  Two different things. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=771.8800000000001s)]
*  Well, he's held up by his sycophants as he's a great businessman. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=772.6800000000001s)]
*  Negotiation doesn't understand basic macroeconomics. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=776.24s)]
*  No, my favorite thing is that he was confused asylums with the so asylums. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=778.52s)]
*  And they're emptying their mental. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=784.28s)]
*  Right. He's stuck on it. Right. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=785.92s)]
*  And everyone's like, that's right. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=787.24s)]
*  And I was like, no, no, it's political asylum, political asylum. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  The best part of Trump is that even when he's corrected, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=792.52s)]
*  he will double down, triple down, carry on. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=796.16s)]
*  So even after everyone's made fun of him, he's still saying asylums. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=798.36s)]
*  They're sending people from their asylums. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=801.24s)]
*  There is no evidence any South American country emptied an asylum. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=803.24s)]
*  No, no, it's a political asylum, which is different than a mental asylum. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=806.12s)]
*  I feel like we're living in. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=810.96s)]
*  I feel like you and I are the children from the emperor's new clothes. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=812.44s)]
*  Right. Right. Everyone knows that he's a moron. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=816.16s)]
*  Yeah. But it's just not. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=819.48s)]
*  I want to say polite. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=821.28s)]
*  It's just not the done thing in American media to say that. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=822.2s)]
*  Right. He's the president. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=825.16s)]
*  Therefore, he gets automatic respect. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=826.44s)]
*  Republicans have 75 million votes. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=827.88s)]
*  You can't call them dumb. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=829.76s)]
*  But a lot of what we're experiencing is dumb. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=831.12s)]
*  Well, we had a period where we could have said [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  it was like a brief period when he was when he was being prosecuted [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=836.6s)]
*  for all the fraud stuff, where it was like, oh, maybe, you know, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=840.8s)]
*  what do you take in home all these documents with him where it was like, oh, wow. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=844.4399999999999s)]
*  But yeah, you're really not supposed to say he's dumb, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=848.88s)]
*  even though it seems pretty clear to me with the way we're at. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=851.52s)]
*  Say Biden has Alzheimer's dementia is out of his wits. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=854.28s)]
*  And, you know, clearly we know from a lot more reporting. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=857.68s)]
*  Yeah, it was in a very bad state. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=860.24s)]
*  Yes. But like Trump just did a speech the other day where he's like groceries. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=861.68s)]
*  It's a very old fashioned word. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=865.76s)]
*  Nobody uses his word anymore. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=867.8399999999999s)]
*  Are you fucking kidding me? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=869.12s)]
*  Nobody uses the word grocery anymore. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=870.5999999999999s)]
*  I feel like people do use the word grocery. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  I feel like I've used it this week. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=874.5999999999999s)]
*  I used it multiple times. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=876.16s)]
*  I feel like I get many texts from my wife saying, have you got the groceries? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=877.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, that was a very strange. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  I mean, when he is riffing, oh, he is riffing. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=882.8399999999999s)]
*  What's the way to use the weave the weave bacon. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=886.8399999999999s)]
*  The thing that is so infuriating, though, and we're going to get back to Democrats [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=890.2800000000001s)]
*  and why Democrats need to completely rethink their messaging strategy, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=894.12s)]
*  is that you should not be able to say bacon and have everyone know what you're talking about. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=899.44s)]
*  And if you are, that means you're an effective communicator in a way. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=906.1600000000001s)]
*  So when Trump said bacon and everyone went, oh, he means inflation, the price of eggs. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=910.0s)]
*  That is Democrats should be able to. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=915.8000000000001s)]
*  He's the master of repetition. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=918.08s)]
*  So he does these stump speeches, lots of rallies. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=919.76s)]
*  He says the same thing. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=921.56s)]
*  He has a very limited vocabulary, limited talking points. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=922.4399999999999s)]
*  But he's charismatic. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=925.04s)]
*  Peter Mandelson, who was the main architect of Tony Blair's election, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=926.72s)]
*  which actually I don't even think he's the British ambassador to the US right now. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=930.4399999999999s)]
*  He's been reborn in a new role. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=933.04s)]
*  He's the current British ambassador to D.C. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=934.92s)]
*  Very famous political strategist in the UK. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=937.04s)]
*  His line, and I mention it in my book, is unless you get as a politician, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=938.72s)]
*  unless you are bored of what you are saying, it has not got through to the public. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=943.68s)]
*  You must keep repeating it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=947.4399999999999s)]
*  Repetition is key. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=948.68s)]
*  And that, I think, is the Democrats biggest problem. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=949.76s)]
*  You know, clarity. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=951.64s)]
*  If they have a single message, stick to it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=952.68s)]
*  Say ad nauseam and go to and go everywhere. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=955.28s)]
*  Go on, Joe Rogan, go on the milk boys. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  Go on and hold back. Right. Right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=960.52s)]
*  So, I mean, me and Kyle Kulinski have both been saying this recently, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  which is the next Democrat presidential candidate should just go out and say shit [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=966.4s)]
*  and just throw shit against the wall and see what works. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=969.92s)]
*  Don't be like, go out and say, I'm going to make. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=972.3599999999999s)]
*  I would love to see the next Democrat president can say, vote for me. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=974.24s)]
*  The minimum wage is going to be thirty dollars an hour. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=977.12s)]
*  Why the fuck not? How are you going to do? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=979.0s)]
*  Oh, trust me. We'll figure it out. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=980.48s)]
*  We'll figure it out. Day one. Vibes. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=981.96s)]
*  I'll do it on day one. Yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=983.64s)]
*  In 24 hours. I'll put the minimum wage at thirty dollars. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=985.08s)]
*  Why the fuck not? This is the America we live in. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=987.84s)]
*  The case is just don't hire anyone else from precision strategies. OK. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=990.6s)]
*  I I'm glad. And anyone who worked on the Biden campaign and covered up his. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=995.84s)]
*  I mean, it's not even they just you can't. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1000.36s)]
*  These guys were and it's funny because I actually had a conversation with Carvel [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1004.16s)]
*  where Carvel was saying, like, you know, the people who work for these companies [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1008.52s)]
*  are probably not the people who should be helping Democrats win. Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1014.0s)]
*  I agree. I mean, I mean, that's a pretty lefty view from a very centrist guy. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1018.6s)]
*  Yeah. And a guy who has no filters. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1023.6s)]
*  We need some people more. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1025.44s)]
*  I don't agree with the politics, but I'm happy with no filters. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1026.68s)]
*  Tim Walsh has come out and said quite openly that he wanted to go out [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1029.24s)]
*  and do town halls and call out Republicans and Harris. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1032.64s)]
*  The campaign, the precision strategy, said no, because they were scared. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1036.24s)]
*  When when weird hit and did well, they shot him down. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1040.76s)]
*  And it was why he was picked. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1045.2s)]
*  I wrote a piece of the guy to pick Tim Walsh, not just because he's calling it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1047.2800000000002s)]
*  Republicans hate him. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1050.5600000000002s)]
*  And they and they were like, shut it down because they're scared of their own [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  shadow. And the reality is we need if a Democrat is going to win and and look, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1055.0400000000002s)]
*  can't be a cautious Democrat. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1060.0s)]
*  It's got to be someone who's going to go out and do every interview and every podcast. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1061.44s)]
*  And that doesn't mean just to clarify, right. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1065.92s)]
*  That doesn't mean you host Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk on your podcast. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1068.2s)]
*  What does this give them a soft ride? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  I'll ask certain presidential contenders. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1073.28s)]
*  Well, this is the problem here. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1075.1200000000001s)]
*  Gavin Newsom should go on Charlie Kirk's podcast and challenge him. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1077.44s)]
*  Go right. He should go on the war room. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1081.68s)]
*  He shouldn't have the war room come on his podcast and then give [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1084.04s)]
*  and then give them a complete free run. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1087.48s)]
*  I think he doesn't understand, like, you need to go where those people are, not [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1089.08s)]
*  bring those people to your people because they already have enough platforms. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1093.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. They are. They are doing great. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1096.6799999999998s)]
*  Oh, but I think it's like a fundamental misunderstanding. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1098.6s)]
*  Like, go where his people are. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1101.52s)]
*  Go on Fox News. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1103.8s)]
*  Are you listening, Governor Newsom to Molly Jones? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1105.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1106.84s)]

*  I can't believe you knew the name of it. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1br63qdfsc&t=1169.48s)]
