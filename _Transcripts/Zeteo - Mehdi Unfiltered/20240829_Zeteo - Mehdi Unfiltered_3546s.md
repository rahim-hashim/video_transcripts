# “Sowing the Seeds for More Hatred”: UN’s Top Gaza Official Speaks to Mehdi Hasan
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw)
*  How does Gaza compare to all the other humanitarian nightmares you've covered, you've had to tackle? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=0.0s)]
*  People are nowhere to flee. They're just waiting for their town to be killed. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=6.8s)]
*  Is the media doing better or worse in covering Trump? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=12.88s)]
*  This is the same man, Donald Trump, who accused all of us in this ecosystem as being the enemy of the people. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=16.48s)]
*  That's Stalin's words, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=21.92s)]
*  The simple logic of eight years ago, put Trump on TV and more people will watch. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=23.52s)]
*  We've moved past that. He's become boring. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=27.52s)]
*  Who do you blame for the way in which the United States left Afghanistan? Trump or Biden? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=30.0s)]
*  The US administrations before 2001 ignored Afghanistan for a decade. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=35.440000000000005s)]
*  And we saw nine of them. Once again, they're ignoring Afghanistan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=40.88s)]
*  This time it's going to be much worse. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=43.92s)]
*  Welcome to Mehdi Unfiltered here in Washington, DC. I'm Mehdi Hassan. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=50.8s)]
*  On today's show, we bring Afghanistan back into the spotlight as I speak to one of the key figures [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=54.56s)]
*  in the anti-Taliban resistance movement. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=59.76s)]
*  We'll also debate why the US media is so ill-equipped to cover the Donald Trump phenomenon again. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  But first, in an exclusive interview, I'll speak with UNRWA chief Philip Lazzarini [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=68.48s)]
*  about Israel's attacks on the Palestinians and on his own UN organization. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  So, what are we waiting for? Let's go. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=77.68s)]
*  Israel does not discriminate in its bombing of Gaza. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  Men, women, children. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=84.96s)]
*  Hospitals, mosques, churches. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=87.36s)]
*  But their attacks in the last few months do seem to be showing a preference. Schools. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=89.92s)]
*  Last week, at least four people were killed and 18 were injured as a result of an Israeli [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=94.88s)]
*  strike on the Salahideen school in Gaza City. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=99.12s)]
*  But that wasn't the first school attack this month. It was the ninth, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=102.08s)]
*  with one of those attacks killing more than 100 people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=105.28s)]
*  And this is uncommon for the most moral army in the world that has bombed more than 500 schools [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=108.4s)]
*  since the war began, many of them run by the same organization, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=114.08s)]
*  the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  Since the start of the war, 70% of UNRWA schools in Gaza have been hit, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=121.12s)]
*  539 people sheltering in them have been killed, and more than 289 aid workers, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=125.44s)]
*  207 of whom worked for UNRWA, have also lost their lives to Israeli bombardment. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=131.68s)]
*  Now, Israel's attacks on UNRWA aren't limited to its staff or its infrastructure [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=137.52s)]
*  or the people they shelter. Israel also attacks UNRWA's credibility again and again. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=142.16s)]
*  In January, the Israeli government alleged that 12 out of UNRWA's 13,000 staff members in Gaza [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=148.16s)]
*  participated in the October 7th attack. And despite providing little to no proof, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  the allegations prompted 16 UN member states to cut their funding to the main relief agency [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=158.96s)]
*  for two million people living in the Gaza Strip during an ongoing genocide. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=164.8s)]
*  Seven months later, Israel is still adding names to that list. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=170.48s)]
*  Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent UNRWA's chief Philip Lazzarini the names of 108 UNRWA [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=174.0s)]
*  employees it alleges to be working as quote unquote terrorist operatives, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=179.6s)]
*  and demanded that those employees be terminated immediately. The Israeli government even adds [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=184.4s)]
*  that plenty more names from UNRWA will be shared in the future. Joining me to discuss [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=188.8s)]
*  Israel's accusations and the humanitarian crisis they are causing in Gaza is UNRWA's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=193.84s)]
*  Commissioner General Philip Lazzarini. Philip Lazzarini, thank you for joining me on Mehdi [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=199.12s)]
*  Unfiltered. Before we get into all of this, I want to ask you about the current humanitarian [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  situation in Gaza. You commented on last week's attacks on one of UNRWA's schools by tweeting, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=210.16s)]
*  Gaza is no place for children anymore. How bad have things gotten as we approach the one year mark [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=215.68s)]
*  for this ugly war? Well I believe Gaza is just becoming un-livable. I mean you heard since last [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=223.6s)]
*  week that there have been again a new number of evacuation order. Basically people are just [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  pinballs. They are moved from one place to the other one depending on the advancement of the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=240.16s)]
*  military operation. And basically in Gaza people are just daily facing either death or disease [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=245.36s)]
*  or hunger. I don't know how much worse it can become. I have to say we are losing and we are [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=255.36s)]
*  lacking words to describe the situation. In the past I many times said that Gaza is a war of all [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=264.24s)]
*  the superlatives. When you look at the level of destruction, the number of people having been [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=273.12s)]
*  killed, the number of people being moved, the artificial hunger which has also been created [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  there. And now when you look at the disease spreading in the Gaza Strip. And the UN Secretary [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  General released a statement last week on the polio outbreak in Gaza that threatens the lives, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=291.12s)]
*  the health of more than 640,000 children under the age of 10 there. He said that without a ceasefire, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=296.16s)]
*  at least a pause in the fighting, a successful vaccination campaign is impossible. How do you [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=302.24s)]
*  vaccinate 600,000 children while Israeli bombs are falling? Well as the Secretary General said, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=308.56s)]
*  we need a humanitarian pause. We need a vaccination, a polio pause to make sure that we can cover [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=316.88s)]
*  all the children under the age of 10. Otherwise, as I said, it will be extraordinary challenging [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=324.24s)]
*  to reach them out. And that would also mean to take the risk to fail our campaign. And that would [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=332.08s)]
*  be a disaster not only for the people in Gaza but as you know, this is a communicable disease [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=337.76s)]
*  which doesn't know any border and could also spread in the entire region including in Israel. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=342.96s)]
*  You haven't been allowed into Gaza for several months now by the Israelis. Why do you think that is? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=350.47999999999996s)]
*  I have been allowed to go to Gaza since January and I do not have a visa to go to my headquarter [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=355.44s)]
*  in Jerusalem since the end of June. I believe that one of the reasons behind this is to put the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=365.2s)]
*  pressure on the agency. You know that there are a lot of calls from the Israeli authorities [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=373.6s)]
*  to dismantle UNRWA and this is certainly one way to put also pressure on the organization. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=380.16s)]
*  Philip Lazzarini, last month Israel accused 108 of your staff members at UNRWA of being quote [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=387.68s)]
*  terrorist operatives. What does that mean exactly and what evidence, if any, did they present to you? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  Well maybe as you know already in January we had 12 staff who have been accused to participate to [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=400.24s)]
*  the October 7 massacre since we had an internal investigation conducted by an independent body [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=405.76s)]
*  of the United Nations which concluded its work at the end of July for which basically half of the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=415.12s)]
*  people have been proven without evidence and other people basically it was said that if we would be [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=422.96s)]
*  in a situation to corroborate and identify the information we might be in a situation where they [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=432.32s)]
*  might have participated to the October 7. Regarding the list of the 100 this is one allegation among [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=438.88s)]
*  others. We take them all very seriously and basically we are asking the Israeli authorities [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=446.88s)]
*  to share information with the organization in order to assess if yes or not we can undertake [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=453.52s)]
*  an investigation. Were you aware that Israel was gathering this new list that they were [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=460.24s)]
*  planning to share it the same week as your pledging conference for funds in New York? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=464.32s)]
*  Do you think the timing was intentional perhaps to try and undermine your organization? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=469.12s)]
*  Well I do believe that you know there are a lot of coordinated action most of the time when the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=474.8s)]
*  agency has a donor conference we have a new allegation being made public but the one you [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=480.88s)]
*  are referring to basically came out already in February if I remember well at the Munich [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=488.72s)]
*  security conference there was a full dossier being distributed by the member states talking about [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=496.8s)]
*  basically list of staff allegedly being a member of the Hamas or the Jihad or list of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=503.36s)]
*  staff having sympathy but since then nothing more has been shared. Last week the Wall Street [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=511.44s)]
*  Journal published a letter from UNRWA responding to Israel's allegations from earlier this year [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=519.6s)]
*  the ones you mentioned accusing first 12 UNRWA employees then seven more a total of 19 of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=524.72s)]
*  participating in the October 7th Hamas attack. The UNRWA letter from your organization said quote [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=530.96s)]
*  the commissioner general of UNRWA terminated the contracts of employees despite the lack of evidence [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=537.28s)]
*  he did it to protect the agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance in Gaza and [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  elsewhere. Looking back Philip Lazzarini do you still stand by your decision to terminate the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=546.48s)]
*  contracts of 10 aid workers on the UNRWA payroll in Gaza when you didn't have any evidence given [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=552.96s)]
*  to you by the Israelis at the time? Your critics would say that just made UNRWA look more guilty [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=558.48s)]
*  than innocent. I would disagree and we have been under heavy critics because of the lack of due [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=563.92s)]
*  diligence and my response at the time was that we will undertake due diligence but a reverse [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=572.64s)]
*  due diligence. It was in the interest of the agency at the time to terminate the contract of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=579.36s)]
*  the staff allegedly having participated to the October 7th attack. The allegations were so [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=586.16s)]
*  horrible and if that would have been the case would constitute such a betrayal to the Palestinian [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=592.64s)]
*  in general but also to the agency that I had no other choice than to take such a bold decision [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=598.72s)]
*  but in parallel the secretary general has initiated an investigation on this allegation and in parallel [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=606.24s)]
*  we have also commissioned a total review of the risk management system of the agency which is a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=614.16s)]
*  famous report which has been delivered by the former minister for an affair Catherine Colonna. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=621.2s)]
*  I believe that independent review that you mentioned found that 10 of the 19 staff as accused by Israel [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=626.48s)]
*  between January and April were cleared due to the absence or the lack of evidence against them. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=632.5600000000001s)]
*  Have any of them been re-employed by UNRWA since? Well they have been cleared on this allegation but [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=638.24s)]
*  we still have the allegation that they might be member of the armed group and before taking a final [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=645.92s)]
*  determination we need also to look into this because as you know UN, United Nations policies [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=653.76s)]
*  are very clear you cannot be a member of UNRWA and at the same time being a member of an armed group. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=660.24s)]
*  The review you mentioned from April also found that Israel didn't express any concerns around any UNRWA staff [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=668.96s)]
*  going back to 2011 these are all very belated concerns that the Israelis are raising but the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  review did outline several recommendations to address the topic of neutrality within your [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=683.2s)]
*  organization. One of the issues they raised and which a lot of people a lot of reports as you know [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=688.08s)]
*  have raised in the past is the issue of the textbooks in UNRWA schools in Gaza which are [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=692.24s)]
*  not just considered to be biased but have been accused of inciting violence of glorifying martyrdom. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=698.24s)]
*  Do you accept that's an issue and if so what steps are you taking to address that? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=704.4s)]
*  Well first of all I'm very proud of our education system here in the region as you know we have [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=710.88s)]
*  more than half a million girls and boys attending our school across the region. We are the only [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=717.84s)]
*  one in the region having a proper human rights curriculum. We are teaching tolerance in our school [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=724.16s)]
*  and we have also reached gender parity before anyone else here in the region. Now as you know [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=732.56s)]
*  also we are living in a region deeply divided where emotions are very high and basically we [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=739.28s)]
*  have an Israeli narrative and a Palestinian narrative and obviously as UN and UNRWA we cannot [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=749.12s)]
*  overcome this two narrative in the absence of a political solution. So meanwhile it is true that [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=756.88s)]
*  there are issues in the textbook which by the way are curriculum from the Palestinian authorities [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=764.64s)]
*  and the Palestinian authorities for which stories are told through the Palestinian narrative [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=770.24s)]
*  contested by the Israeli but fortunately as a United Nations organisation we have the narrative [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=777.6800000000001s)]
*  of the international community and the United Nations and this is what is being taught in our schools. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=784.64s)]
*  And on the subject of those schools Israel has bombed a lot of those schools including last week [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=792.0s)]
*  killing a lot of families sheltering within the kids there. How shocked have you been to see how [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=798.72s)]
*  casually Israel and the United States which is backing Israel has disregarded [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=808.08s)]
*  international humanitarian law when it comes to protected sites like schools? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=813.0400000000001s)]
*  I express myself many times it's absolutely shocking this routine blatant disregard of [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=817.2s)]
*  the United Nations of the international humanitarian law. If you look at Gaza the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=824.48s)]
*  number of UN staff being killed, the number of premises having been destroyed, the number of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  people killed while in these premises, the number of convoys being targeted, there is a routine [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=836.0799999999999s)]
*  blatant disregard of the humanitarian organisation and of IHL but beyond that we have also the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=844.16s)]
*  political attack against the agency, the call for the dismantlement of the agency, the legislative [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=852.88s)]
*  effort at the Knesset to label the organisation as a terrorist organisation and this would be [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=860.16s)]
*  absolutely unbelievable. A UN member state labeling a UN organisation as a terrorist organisation, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=867.6s)]
*  an organisation having a mandate from all the other member states member of the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=876.96s)]
*  General Assembly this would be absolutely unprecedented but let's do no mistake it's [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=884.4s)]
*  not just an attack on UNRWA it's an attack on the broader UN system it's an attack on the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=890.96s)]
*  multilateral system it's an attack on all those who are promoting a different narrative all those [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=897.04s)]
*  supporting in fact the past the political past of a two-state solution here in the region. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=905.76s)]
*  You mentioned the attempt to label UNRWA a terrorist organisation at least three bills [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=913.76s)]
*  are in the Knesset in the Israeli parliament aiming to shut down your organisation in Israel [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=919.84s)]
*  as a terrorist group. To your knowledge does Israel have an alternative for UNRWA if those [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=923.68s)]
*  bills were to pass if they succeeded in shutting you down? If UNRWA didn't exist what would be [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=928.8s)]
*  happening to the Palestinians in Gaza right now what is the alternative? Well the real question is [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=934.64s)]
*  who would take over for example the education of the girls and boys deeply traumatised living in [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=940.56s)]
*  the rubble in Gaza today we talk about 600 000 girls and boys from the primary and secondary [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=949.1999999999999s)]
*  school age there is no one else beside UNRWA except a functioning government functioning [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=958.72s)]
*  administration which can provide education at scale to such a number of children. Now the more [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=965.6s)]
*  we wait the more we will be sowing the seeds for more hatred revenge and violence in the future [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=973.12s)]
*  so now I do not see who else can step in and take over the activities of the agency. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=982.4s)]
*  Philip Lazzarini I think it was 16 countries that cut funding to your organisation when Israel made [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=991.1999999999999s)]
*  those accusations against your staffers back in January all of them have resumed their funding I [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=995.68s)]
*  believe except the United States. What is your message to President Biden and to Vice President [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1001.12s)]
*  Kamala Harris who is currently running to succeed him? Well the United States has been a long-standing [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1006.5600000000001s)]
*  partner of the agency has been until now the first financial provider to the agency and I really hope [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1012.8000000000001s)]
*  that in the absence of a political solution support to UNRWA will continue because otherwise [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1022.96s)]
*  it will be perceived by the Palestinian as a disinterest or an international community [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1029.28s)]
*  turning its back to a proper lasting political solution. Do you agree with the chief prosecutor [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1036.48s)]
*  of the International Criminal Court who like many humanitarian aid agencies has accused Israel of [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1043.44s)]
*  blocking aid going into Gaza he's also said Israel is using starvation as a method of war? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1049.04s)]
*  Well clearly the assistance is not commensurate to the need we are daily struggling to bring [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1054.48s)]
*  assistance into the Gaza Strip and I have been on record more than once we have been in a situation [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1063.28s)]
*  where hunger has been created artificially in the Gaza Strip this is a region which [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1070.64s)]
*  before this war never really encountered hunger except in a war situation or in situation [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1077.76s)]
*  where a siege was imposed on the Strip. You say hunger has been artificially created at the start [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1085.04s)]
*  of this interview you said Israel has made Gaza unlivable is what we are seeing in Gaza then in [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1091.2s)]
*  your view a genocide? Well this will leave the ICC and the ICG to determine the qualification [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1097.84s)]
*  of what happened but what I can say is that there have been unprecedented suffering inflicted to the [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1108.0s)]
*  population as I said this has been the war of all the superlatives look at the number of people killed [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1116.72s)]
*  the number of children killed the level of displacement constant displacement. What about [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1124.64s)]
*  war crimes Philip Lazzarini if it's not genocide do you agree that attacking UNRWA schools is a [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1130.48s)]
*  war crime? I do believe we need an investigation and indeed it would constitute as a war crime. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1135.2800000000002s)]
*  I am not the legal or the judge who will label it as war crime but I do believe that this blatant [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  violation of IHL might constitute a war crime. Philip Lazzarini prior to heading up UNRWA in [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1150.96s)]
*  2020 you worked I believe at the Red Cross at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1160.48s)]
*  Affairs at the UN Development Program you've spent decades in this field in conflict zones around the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1165.8400000000001s)]
*  world how does Gaza compare to all the other humanitarian nightmares you've covered you've had [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1172.4s)]
*  to tackle? Well first of all it's a war taking place in an area where people are nowhere to flee [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1179.04s)]
*  and this is quite exceptional there is a no border to cross and people are constantly on the move [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1189.6s)]
*  traditionally when you are in a conflict situation you might be pushed once moved once or twice you [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1197.36s)]
*  cross a border but you are settled until the end of the war this has not been the case in [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1202.72s)]
*  Gaza if you listen to the people there people have been displaced 15 up to 20 times they have [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1208.24s)]
*  absolutely nowhere to go but the other element which strikes me is the absence of international [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1214.8s)]
*  media how is it possible after 10 months to be in such a highly mediatized context that international [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1222.88s)]
*  media are not allowed to see by themselves what is really going on and that means in this world [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1232.64s)]
*  there is also a very strong element of propaganda. It's a good point you make about propaganda and [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1241.68s)]
*  about the the lack of international media and even though there are many brave Palestinian [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1249.1200000000001s)]
*  journalists reporting on the ground getting killed doing so obviously one of the big claims [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1252.88s)]
*  aside from the fact that some of your staffers may have taken part in October the 7th even though [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1257.92s)]
*  the evidence hasn't really been provided the other claim the Israelis make is that Hamas are hiding [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  under your schools that they've built tunnels under your schools under your refugee camps under [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1268.08s)]
*  your office buildings they also claim that you knew about it what is your response to that claim? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1273.04s)]
*  First of all whenever we had a suspicion in the past that there might be a tunnel nearby a premise [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1278.16s)]
*  of the agencies we systematically constantly informed both the de facto authority in Gaza [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1288.64s)]
*  being the Hamas but also the Kogat being the Israeli authorities so we have been always [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1296.5600000000002s)]
*  extremely transparent in whatever we were able to observe or to witness. Secondly I mean as a [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1303.6s)]
*  human development organization or humanitarian organization I do not have the military expertise [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1312.32s)]
*  to look at what's underneath the entire Gaza Strip and we have obviously discovered or heard [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1317.6s)]
*  about tens if not hundreds of kilometers of a tunnel in Gaza very few [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1325.12s)]
*  underneath if none our school they were always nearby at least the allegation I have heard [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1332.3999999999999s)]
*  until now so my point here is to say all this allegation needs to be investigated first we need [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1341.76s)]
*  to investigate the killing of the UN staff we need to investigate all the damages which have [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1351.44s)]
*  been caused and people who have been killed in our premises but we need also to investigate [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1357.44s)]
*  all this allegation and this is the reason why I'm calling also for the setting up of a board of [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1362.96s)]
*  inquiry. Last question Philip Lazzarini you haven't been able to enter Gaza this year as you said [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1369.2s)]
*  when you speak to your staff on the ground in Gaza the ones who haven't been killed both [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1376.4s)]
*  Palestinian and non-Palestinian what do they tell you about what life is like right now for them in [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1382.0s)]
*  Gaza at UNRWA locations that are supposedly protected? Already the last time I went which [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1386.4s)]
*  was in January I was struck on how people were just living in a pilot automatic mode and also [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1393.2800000000002s)]
*  the absence of light in their eyes it seems the situation has gone even much worse though it was [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1402.16s)]
*  difficult to comprehend that it could get worse and today when I talk to my staff they are saying [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1410.0800000000002s)]
*  that in reality people today are so resignated that they are just waiting for their turn to be [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1417.2s)]
*  killed in the Gaza Strip and this is absolutely heartbreaking because people have lost face of a [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1424.72s)]
*  possible a better future. Yes they have it's a tragedy Philip Lazzarini Commissioner General of [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1433.1200000000001s)]
*  UNRWA thank you for taking time out from Heady Unfiltered today appreciate it. Thank you Lady [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1440.4s)]
*  it was my pleasure. I've said it before and I'll say it again our both sides media in this country [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1445.76s)]
*  is just not ready and able to cover Donald Trump's third campaign for President of the United States [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1452.4s)]
*  it's just not up to the task it's not fit for purpose it's broken and I'm not just talking about [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1457.76s)]
*  the softball questions that he and his acolytes get from reporters and TV anchors or the ridiculous [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1462.5600000000002s)]
*  op-ed that the New York Times published this week headlined Trump can win on character and no that's [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1467.6000000000001s)]
*  not a headline from the onion it's real but I'm also referring to the way in which fact checkers [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1472.48s)]
*  from our major media outlets are basically acting like apologists and excuse makers for Trump and [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1477.6s)]
*  the Trump campaign because they so desperately want to look fair and balanced even though one [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1482.48s)]
*  side are serial liars and the other side are not when Joe Biden at the DNC said Trump as president [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1487.12s)]
*  had quote created the largest debt any president had in four years the New York Times called it [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1493.44s)]
*  misleading because Barack Obama created more debt in eight years so Joe Biden was right because he [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1497.92s)]
*  said four years the Washington Post had to correct its own fact check after it tried to [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1504.0s)]
*  suggest Kamala Harris was wrong to say Trump exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un I mean [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1508.08s)]
*  we all heard him say it the media as I say is broken so how bad is the coverage could it affect [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1513.52s)]
*  the election result and how do we fix it joining me now are two of the media's most eloquent critics [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1519.44s)]

*  curve you have to say they're doing worse because eight years ago was the first time you know Donald [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1550.56s)]
*  Trump had been around forever in the media but he'd never run for president before now we are seeing [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1555.04s)]
*  just the same things and just the same way in any if anything with more of an air of defensiveness [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1560.56s)]

*  this moment in particular is a moment where those of us however flawed we may be try our best to [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1606.96s)]
*  promote democracy you should be biased in favor of democracy in a democracy where you have the [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  freedom of the press to ask the tough questions what we're up against is a right-wing authoritarian [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1620.3999999999999s)]
*  movement that has openly said that we don't care about the rule of law this is same man Donald [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1624.8s)]
*  Trump who accused all of us in this ecosystem as being the enemy of the people that's Stalin's [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1629.12s)]
*  words right he accuses of being fake news and so you would think the people that he's attacking [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1634.24s)]
*  would say you know what if this guy wins maybe life won't be good for us but instead they go up [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1639.36s)]
*  to him they cozy up to him they create this both sides false equivalence where you have 32,000 lies [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1644.4799999999998s)]
*  and misleading statements of Donald Trump and they're like but we have to create balance yeah [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1649.52s)]
*  it's a deliberate creation of balance yeah what they're doing at the dns complete asymmetry [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1654.6399999999999s)]
*  and that's why you have like you said this hilarious fact checks where we had a one hour [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1658.56s)]
*  press conference with Trump and Mar-a-Lago where he repeats lies after lies where Democrats are [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1663.6799999999998s)]

*  yesterday um Jim back in 2016 the then ceo of cbs watch out mentioned corporate media [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1682.56s)]
*  ceo of cbs les moonvers famously said about the trump campaign it may not be good for America [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1688.64s)]
*  but it's damn good for cbs is that still the attitude do you think from corporate media [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1693.76s)]
*  bosses today to trump and a third presidential campaign more views more clicks more ratings [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1698.48s)]
*  or is that too simplistic um i think it is still a factor but i think there are [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1703.28s)]
*  in a way worse aspects than that now because the simple logic of eight years ago put trump on tv [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1708.24s)]
*  and more people will watch we've moved past that he's become boring and many people in his team [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1713.52s)]
*  think it may actually backfire on him to show these things at full length so it's other sort [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1718.4s)]
*  of cultural things i think the the structural issue about the major media now that is really [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1722.56s)]
*  problematic is their entire defensiveness and non-transparency remember back when the new york [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1728.8s)]
*  times had a public editor at least that person could ask people who are writing these headlines [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1734.0s)]
*  writing these social cells that usually have more influence than the story itself and say [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1739.04s)]
*  why did you do this i mean why back in the the 16 campaign did you devote the entire front page [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1744.32s)]
*  a week before the election to james comey and hillary clinton's emails why are you portraying [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1750.24s)]
*  what trump says in an insane literally insane press conference with a platform from camila harrison [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1755.2s)]
*  saying both sides present clear economic visions there's a bias towards normalizing things that are [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1761.68s)]
*  objectively crazy and being afraid to say this is crazy this is outside the normal bounds and also [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1767.92s)]
*  the fact that you're talking about the emails all of them publish the emails yes they decide not to [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1773.44s)]
*  i was about to say you know that's the big question right now you have for a new york times public [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1778.4s)]
*  editor what's the reason you're not publishing any of these emails i mean you have to mass dump [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1781.76s)]
*  them yeah but you must have found something interesting in there that's not related to [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1785.8400000000001s)]
*  hacking that's of public interest that you could have shared by now about the you know the great [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1788.88s)]
*  man that is jd van i just give a a point there that that back it is true that when the earlier [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1793.28s)]
*  emails came out they were released publicly by wikipedia and so people could find that [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1798.64s)]
*  wikipedia sorry sorry sorry yes wiki wiki leaks uh so thank you for real time fact check yeah there [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1803.1999999999998s)]
*  you go in the spirit of uh dale who's the you know daniel dale who is a good fact checker we [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1807.84s)]
*  all defend daniel dale amongst the other the cnn fact checker so what made the the wiki leaks email [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1813.1999999999998s)]
*  so powerful was that all the newspapers adopted them as major story so they're curious to take [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1818.6399999999999s)]
*  out over the next couple of weeks that has not happened at all in the other extreme with i would [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1823.28s)]
*  argue most americans probably don't know these emails even exist yes that there are these jd [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1827.6s)]
*  gordon jd gordon jd vance they're all getting names released uh to politico new york times and [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1831.52s)]
*  i believe washington post are three who who are sitting on them um what jim mentioned earlier [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1837.92s)]
*  the idea that it's worse now because they know better right they know and he's talked about [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1843.12s)]
*  non-transparency you have been a contributor to the new york times to cnn you've sat in those [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1847.04s)]
*  studios in those green rooms you've had conversations with print editors at quote unquote liberal media [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1852.08s)]
*  outlets do they just have no self awareness that they're effectively giving up i'm just wondering [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1857.84s)]
*  is it is it a lack i want to be generous is it a lack of self-awareness they just don't realize [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1866.48s)]
*  they're being played or is it a deliberate fake contrarianism i would say both but i would say [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1870.56s)]
*  regardless i'm not be both sorry to be well let me put it this way let me put this way i'm not god [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1876.1599999999999s)]
*  so i don't know what's in their hearts but it's been nine years maybe it's almost a decade you [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1880.24s)]
*  have to learn you have to be agile you have to adapt you have to meet the moment and what we have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1884.56s)]
*  seen by their deliberate actions is they refuse to meet the moment they refuse to be agile they [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1888.56s)]
*  seem they seem the reason why i say both is number one i feel like that a moment in 2020 where they [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1892.8s)]
*  were and now we've regressed to 2016 well because well i'll tell you what i said both is because [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1897.44s)]
*  they they i think are incapable of breaking this mold of both sides where sometimes you literally [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1902.1599999999999s)]
*  are sitting there and like this person is lying they're like but we like it's like a robot like [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1908.32s)]
*  terminator like arnold schurzinger just breaking down we must do both sides and i always say you [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1911.76s)]
*  don't have to do both sides if one side is lying profusely you have to just be committed towards [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1916.32s)]
*  the truth be biased towards the truth the second thing i would say and i'm so glad you mentioned [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1921.44s)]
*  that les moonves quote because that shows you the north star of corporate media which i know might [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1925.2s)]
*  be too cynical so there's really good journalists maybe really good people we've worked there before [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1930.16s)]
*  but the north star is not truth the north star is ratings power access to power and money and that [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1934.64s)]
*  trumps at the end of the day and what they're betting on is this man trump might actually win [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1941.12s)]
*  and if he wins we have to be on his good side because we need to book those guests yeah and [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1947.1999999999998s)]
*  i got asked this question about the new york times which gets a lot of you know hate on social media [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1954.2399999999998s)]
*  from liberals uh but you know it's a paper of record and does seem to be running some really [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1958.9599999999998s)]
*  odd stuff i mentioned the intro the trump can win on character which is not an onion headline [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1963.76s)]
*  a lot of headlines both side zing and as you say normalizing the abnormal how come the new york [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1968.96s)]
*  times in your future sorry to ask you to be godlike why don't get into their heads how come it was so [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1974.72s)]
*  obsessed with joe biden's age and mental fitness and yet we have not seen even 10 of the same [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1979.76s)]
*  coverage and intensity given to donald trump's manifest mental unfitness process and i think [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1986.88s)]
*  this is centers in the times but it's true of all the major media that we had over the last [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1991.76s)]
*  year or two stories about biden whether we're in his cognitive fitness to govern and of course [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=1996.8s)]
*  after the disastrous debate that went went way up to my knowledge we have seen either zero or close [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2003.6000000000001s)]
*  to zero of those serious stories about trump where the framing is not how is this affecting his [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2010.56s)]
*  staying on message you know is this getting in the way of his appeal and good that's this or that [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2016.08s)]
*  bloke but a block but what would this mean for fitness to govern which was the frame for everything [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2020.24s)]
*  about biden the i'm going to give one other comparison about the times itself recall that [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2025.76s)]
*  think back to the days of the iraq war and you recall what the new york times is doing in the [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2031.84s)]
*  bill of the iraq war after that to his credit bill keller who was then the executive editor ran a [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2035.92s)]
*  kind of truth squad of what happened here how did we get that so wrong after the but about her emails [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2042.0s)]
*  what about her emails fiasco eight years ago dean bakke of the new york times would not entertain [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2047.76s)]
*  any questions whatsoever they were just following the news and that seems to have been the instinct [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2053.28s)]
*  that has prevailed that just we're covering the news where we don't want to get involved in this [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2057.84s)]
*  active politicking and that is so destructive and jim just a follow-up on the times someone like [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2062.8s)]
*  michael cohen not trump's lawyer the msnbc columnist former state department speech i often [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2067.92s)]
*  noticed he often berates his fellow liberals online say why are you all obsessing over the times [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2072.1600000000003s)]
*  it doesn't matter it's not like trump voters read the times none of this matters what would you say [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2076.5600000000004s)]
*  i would say au contraire in uh in two two layers one is i still think that 95 percent of what's in [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2080.8s)]
*  the times is the best journalism there is so their coverage of science or technology or the [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2087.12s)]
*  rest of the world if they covered u.s politics the way they cover everything else we'd be a lot better [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2091.6s)]
*  situation number two there is still an enormous legitimizing and normalizing and framing power [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2097.36s)]
*  that new york times had it mattered in the 2016 election that you know 10 days before the election [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2103.92s)]
*  the new york times devoted its entire front page with some little exception at the bottom [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2109.52s)]
*  to hillary clinton's emails and what james comey has said they still even steve bannon checks them [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2114.88s)]
*  out even you know everybody checks them out it's a sort of it is an indicator of which way things [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2120.4s)]
*  are going so very few people read it but a lot of people are influenced by it wonder if bannon gets [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2125.36s)]
*  a physical copy in his prison cell um what you and i are brown people yes joked for a while we turn [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2130.24s)]

*  how the media fest jim one last question to you you've written about this stuff you've thought [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2218.56s)]
*  about this stuff for a long time how do we fix our quote unquote liberal media is there an obvious [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2222.48s)]
*  way to right the wrongs that we've been discussing uh short answer no uh longer answer is is it's the [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2227.68s)]
*  same thing they say about uh saving local news nothing might work but everything might work and [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2234.72s)]
*  so i think the matter of people continuing to speak up and just to return to your previous [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2240.16s)]
*  point for a second speaking as the old white guy here i think there is a failure of imagination [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2244.88s)]
*  which will equate to how i felt the years i was living in china that most foreigners most [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2249.68s)]
*  americans most white americans felt that however dark things got there it wasn't going to affect [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2255.04s)]
*  us the worst that would happen is they'd kick us out i think that same failure of american [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2259.8399999999997s)]
*  a failure of imagination applies for many liberal white journalists now that it's hard to sort of [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2264.3199999999997s)]

*  control very grim basically what we see today in afghanistan is gender apartheid [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2515.68s)]
*  women have been erased from public life their basic rights have been taken away from them [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2523.3599999999997s)]
*  you mentioned the set of laws that came out last week that's just one example but in the past three [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2530.96s)]
*  years we've seen them every few months coming out with new decrees new laws restricting women from [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2536.3199999999997s)]
*  partaking in anything even their basic rights look afghanistan for example just to give you [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2544.24s)]
*  an example most of afghanistan's houses lack uh uh modern plumbing they don't have a bathroom [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2552.7999999999997s)]

*  baths to visiting public baths so they can't fulfill their religious obligations of a group [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2570.4s)]
*  that calls themselves so-called an islamic group an islamic emirate they're [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2575.6s)]
*  prohibiting women from fulfilling their religious obligations so this is how bad and bleak their [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2583.2000000000003s)]
*  situation is in inside afghanistan today and the world it has turned a blind eye and is tolerating [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2589.28s)]
*  the taliban are unfortunately engaging with them on a daily basis not just a blind eye some people [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2595.12s)]
*  have criticized the american government making things worse in the aftermath of the taliban's [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2599.92s)]
*  takeover the biden administration famously froze seven billion dollars in funds for afghanistan out [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2604.2400000000002s)]
*  of fear that the money would end up in the hands of terrorist groups since then president biden [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2609.28s)]
*  has allowed for half of that money to be sought out by 9 11 victims families and the other half [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2613.44s)]
*  to the swiss-based afghan fund which is yet to be distributed inside of afghanistan how urgent is it [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2618.7200000000003s)]
*  for that money to get to the people of afghanistan is there a way to get it to the people of afghanistan [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2623.92s)]
*  without it going through the taliban and what do you make of this claim by 9 11 families for [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2628.64s)]
*  that money which is afghan money well unfortunately the situation is much more complex since august [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2632.8799999999997s)]

*  groups have been exploiting this u.s aid the reason is countries like the united states and [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2668.24s)]
*  others in the international community they're not paying attention that afghanistan doesn't have a [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2673.3599999999997s)]
*  legitimate government it's in a state of anarchy a terrorist group made up of different factions [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2676.8799999999997s)]

*  to form a legitimate government based on the will of the people that can represent afghanistan [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2687.84s)]
*  and that can alleviate the humanitarian crisis that the people of afghanistan are facing this [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2693.84s)]
*  is one thing that we've been pushing that afghanistan needs a government that represents [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2699.04s)]
*  its diversity that represents every single citizen whether it's men or women and a government [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2703.92s)]

*  elections free and fair elections we cannot depend on the taliban to receive seven billion [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2717.28s)]
*  which belongs to afghanistan's people and to distribute it we know where that money is going [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2722.2400000000002s)]

*  catastrophic because afghanistan's government parties like us time after time we warned the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2803.12s)]
*  implications of a hasty withdrawal from afghanistan we weren't against the withdrawal that's a decision [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2810.0s)]
*  that the united states should have made and we respected that however it should be should have [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2816.96s)]
*  been a dignified withdrawal it should have been been a withdrawal that could have protected [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2822.48s)]
*  afghanistan's government from collapsing yet they took decisions that directly caused the collapse [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2828.56s)]
*  of afghanistan's own forces caused the collapse of the government and created the conditions that we [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2835.6s)]
*  see today the counter argument to that is that the government was going to collapse no matter how you [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2839.76s)]
*  did the withdrawal and the fact that it collapsed so quickly when even u.s intelligence u.s military [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2844.16s)]
*  chiefs were saying it'll take several months for the taliban to conquer the country they did it in [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2848.64s)]
*  a matter of days that tells you the critics would say that the government was just never had any [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2852.16s)]
*  support any popular base any competent military so whether you go slowly whether you go quickly [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2858.0s)]
*  the end result is the taliban takes over the country there's a few reasons to counter this [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2863.12s)]
*  one is afghanistan's armed forces bravely fought for years we lost 80 000 forces from 2014 to 2021 [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2869.7599999999998s)]
*  fight in august 2021 they collapsed that's a fact in the reason they collapsed in august 2021 is [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2876.7999999999997s)]
*  because the united states withdrew all the support that could have sustained the armed forces [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2882.88s)]
*  look the armed forces that were the model that the united states [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2888.4s)]
*  uh intentionally adopted for afghanistan's armed forces two decades ago created dependency [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  between afghanistan's armed forces and u.s presence in afghanistan so the united states didn't put [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2900.48s)]
*  guarantees after its withdrawal for the armed forces to survive when the armed forces were [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2905.6000000000004s)]
*  dependent on contractors on the united states to maintain its equipment on u.s uh advisors when all [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2912.6400000000003s)]
*  of these from the country it was it was uh inevitable for the collapse so i wonder doesn't [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2921.44s)]
*  that make it difficult for you now as a member of the national resistance from the nrf to say [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2929.04s)]
*  we want foreign support because we've seen this film before and you yourself are saying it didn't [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2932.96s)]
*  work out the first time so what would what would foreign military support for the nrf look like [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2937.44s)]
*  right now tangible what is it you're looking for from the american government for example to make [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  something clear on august 2021 august 15 2021 thousands of afghanistan's armed forces came to [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2946.88s)]
*  the pine chair valley in the north and declared the resistance under the banner of the nrf [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2952.8s)]
*  so not everyone abandoned the fight and for the past three years without any external support [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2957.92s)]
*  without the scent going to us we've continued our resistance fighting the taliban but my question [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2963.28s)]
*  is you're here in dc my question is do you want external support for the nrf of course for us [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2968.56s)]
*  to defeat regional and international terrorism we need the international community to wake up [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2973.84s)]
*  and realize there's a threat inside Afghanistan i'm asking specifics what does that look like you [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2979.92s)]
*  want fighter jets you want troops on the ground you want special what do you what do you want [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2983.6800000000003s)]
*  when the taliban and 21 other terrorist groups have seven billion dollars worth of u.s arms munitions [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2987.52s)]
*  and equipment of course we need support whether it's the united states or any other country to [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2993.6000000000004s)]
*  allow us to defeat them militarily with non-lethal and lethal here's my question given what you just [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=2998.8s)]
*  described wouldn't we aren't we just repeating the same cycle let's say you defeat them you defeat [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3004.32s)]
*  the taliban you take back control taliban doesn't disappear they become the resistance you're back [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3008.48s)]
*  and back to square one same american government support same dependency at it we're this cycle [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3013.76s)]
*  never ends well if you remember in 2001 2002 of course many mistakes were made in the beginning [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3018.6400000000003s)]
*  the taliban were willing to surrender when they were defeated but the administration back then [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3026.0s)]
*  didn't accept their surrender and we saw the insurgency for 20 years but what's the truth [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3031.36s)]
*  mehdi is today it's not an internal conflict within afghanistan al-qaeda is experiencing [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3038.64s)]
*  resurgence iskp regional terrorist groups look the the threat that pakistan faces to pakistan was [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3045.2s)]
*  the taliban's number one sponsor and supporter for 30 years but pakistanis are saying the greatest [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3052.32s)]
*  threat today what they're saying is the greatest threat to our security and stability is the taliban [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3058.32s)]
*  so as long as the taliban control a country the size of france not only are the people of afghanistan [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3064.32s)]
*  facing a threat against the taliban i think we all understand the case against taliban what i'm [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3071.28s)]
*  asking you though is you mentioned 2001 and there was a surrender offer cars i wanted to do a power [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3074.88s)]
*  sharing deal with the taliban that was what was turned down would you guys do a power sharing deal [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3080.08s)]
*  with the taliban if they were to if they were to kind of put down their weapon and say just do a [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3084.64s)]
*  deal is the nrf willing to go into coalition with the taliban what's different what we're asking is [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3088.56s)]
*  different than what happened after 9 11 we're not asking for boots on the ground yeah we have [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3094.08s)]
*  capable fighters who have shown their capabilities and their determination the last three years to [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3100.16s)]
*  what we need is resources minimal resources enable for us to expand our efforts to conventionally [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3105.6s)]
*  challenge the taliban as to start liberating the country it's much different than what happened [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3112.7200000000003s)]
*  after 9 11 what about the argument that says afghanistan is a war-torn country all you're [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3116.4s)]
*  offering is more war that in places like the panchayat valley they don't care about either of [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3120.32s)]
*  you innocent villagers are being killed in this fighting what do you say to that well it our [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3124.88s)]
*  vision matters which is different from the taliban we're fighting to establish a democratic [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3128.88s)]
*  decentralized pluralistic afghanistan where every single citizen enjoys equal rights because [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3134.32s)]
*  afghanistan is a diverse country we have to guarantee equal rights to all ethnic groups [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3139.1200000000003s)]
*  religious groups and others that's not what the taliban are doing what the taliban are doing [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3143.1200000000003s)]
*  is putting afghanistan on the trajectory of a vicious cycle of violence and of course [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3147.84s)]
*  unfortunately the trajectory that the taliban have put afghanistan is a trajectory where [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3155.04s)]
*  we face the dismemberment of the country in the future so so we are going to see chaos and crisis [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3158.8s)]
*  not only in inside afghanistan but regionally and internationally because of the existence of the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3164.32s)]
*  taliban so but by supporting democratic forces like us we will allow conditions to come and [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3168.4s)]
*  so on the ground to end this vicious cycle of violence by guaranteeing the rights of every [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3174.1600000000003s)]
*  citizen inside afghanistan and guaranteeing the security of the region and international community [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3179.6000000000004s)]
*  you say you are a democratic force the last afghan government often said it was a democratic [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3184.2400000000002s)]
*  government it was riddled with corruption i think no one can deny the last afghan government [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3189.84s)]
*  was a pretty corrupt as was predecessor governments the nrf your group has several [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3195.92s)]
*  members from that former corrupt government who have themselves been accused of corruption [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3201.76s)]
*  and one expert said that your leader masood has turned the nrf into a quote family business [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3206.7200000000003s)]
*  wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars on corruption and family feud how do you expect [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3212.56s)]

*  didn't believe that the constitution would have strengthened democracy so we were asking for [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3238.08s)]
*  constitutional reform for a more decentralized uh political system in order for democracy to [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04IaJEBIKxw&t=3244.24s)]
