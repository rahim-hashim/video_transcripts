Video Description: “No matter what political disagreements and political animus and anger we have at Hamas and the leadership in Gaza, those kids are innocent.”

Academy Award-winning artist John Legend joins Mehdi Hasan for an exclusive interview to discuss Gaza, Trump and criminal justice reform.

Legend performed at the DNC this summer, yet he is one of the few A-list celebrities who isn’t afraid to criticize Harris and the Democrats’ unconditional support for Israel’s assault on Gaza. He also talks about his latest initiatives on prison reform with his nonprofit freeamerica.

# John Legend Talks to Mehdi Hasan about Gaza, Trump, and Criminal Justice Reform | EXCLUSIVE
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8)
*  President Trump acts like he's the victim of this rig system and he's a beneficiary of the rig system. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=0.0s)]
*  I also want progressives to be careful about this whole [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=5.48s)]
*  prosecutor versus felon language. When they talk about Vice President Harris running against [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=9.26s)]
*  former President Trump, I work with people with felony convictions all the time and I fight for their right to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=15.18s)]
*  reintegrate back into society, their right to vote, and I don't want us to continue the idea of putting stigma on these folks. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=21.66s)]
*  How devastating has it been for you both as parents to see how many kids have been killed in Gaza? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  16,000 probably more. It's stunning to see it. It also makes me [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=35.800000000000004s)]
*  very frustrated [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=41.64s)]
*  how [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  easily [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=45.44s)]
*  we dehumanize certain people [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=46.72s)]
*  based on where they live, the color of their skin, their religion, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=50.32s)]
*  whether or not they're allies with our country. We all agree, as you just very eloquently put it, what happened on October 7th was horrific. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=55.08s)]
*  Innocent people killed. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=61.56s)]
*  But when it comes, we can all say that, right? Happily. When it comes to Gaza, we're not all willing to say that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=63.16s)]
*  Why do you think so many people just don't want to touch this issue with a barge bar? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=68.24s)]
*  Republicans are once again resorting to their classic fear-mongering [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=78.44s)]
*  tactics as they try to drum up crime in this election through racist tropes and blame it all on the Democrats. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=81.52s)]
*  Not only is this despite the party's presidential candidate being a convicted felon, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=87.68s)]
*  but it's also despite the fact that violent crime has actually fallen since 2020 when Donald Trump was last in office. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  One person who is not afraid to talk about both those realities is multi award-winning musician John Legend. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  Yes, the acclaimed artist is also a longtime advocate for criminal justice reform. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=104.64s)]
*  You may remember back in 2015 when he devoted his Oscar speech to the topic, telling the audience there, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=109.52s)]
*  quote, that there are more black men under correctional control today than there were under slavery in 1850. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=115.2s)]
*  And his organization, Free America, not only is working to end mass incarceration, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  but also to change the false crime and incarceration narratives that Republicans like Trump love to tout. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  Of course, John Legend's activism doesn't stop at prison reform. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=132.08s)]
*  He also has a long history with the Democratic Party and fighting against Trump. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=136.04s)]
*  He endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, President Joe Biden in 2020, and now Vice President Kamala Harris, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  with John Legend actually performing at the DNC in Chicago this past August. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  Recently, I sat down for an interview with John to discuss his latest projects with Free America and the upcoming election, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  and Gaza too. Have a watch. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=158.76s)]
*  John Legend, thanks for coming on Zatea. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=162.12s)]
*  It's great to be here. Congratulations on your new home and all the success you've been having with it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=166.12s)]
*  And I'm excited to be here to talk with you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=173.08s)]
*  We're very excited to be in your home. Thank you for taking time out of your schedule. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=175.88s)]
*  Of course. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=178.36s)]
*  A lot to talk about. We're going to start. No messing around. We get straight into it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=178.76s)]
*  Let's get into it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=182.28s)]
*  Criminal justice reform is something you have become identified with, known for, passionate about. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=183.16s)]
*  You and I have had multiple conversations about it over the years. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=187.72s)]
*  For people who aren't initiated with the work you do, I think most people remember the Oscar speech in 2015. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=190.52s)]
*  You don't go up and give the usual thank you speech and wait to get musicked out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=197.0s)]
*  You go up and you say there are more black men under correction control today than there were under slavery in 1850. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=200.6s)]
*  A shockingly true statement, but not something everyone was saying at that time. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=206.92s)]
*  Just briefly for our viewers, how do you get to that point? How does John Legend in 2015, why is he talking about it? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=211.96s)]
*  Well, I started reading about it and I was being informed by experts in the field. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=218.04s)]
*  People like Michelle Alexander, who wrote the New Jim Crow. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=223.16s)]
*  People like Bryan Stevenson, who's done so much work around justice and helping us face these issues and think about them, both in thinking about the data and the policy, but also the human lives who were involved. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=226.04s)]
*  And, you know, one of the things I said on the stage was that we're the most incarcerated country in the world. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=240.76s)]
*  And I think that's a really important fact to always keep in mind. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  We incarcerate more people than anybody in the world. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  And some of our states around the country, I was just in Louisiana, it's the most incarcerated state, or it's usually one or two in the country. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=253.08s)]
*  And if you compare their incarceration rates to other countries around the world, it's it's drastic the difference. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  And so I think we should all realize that and and then think on a holistic level, is being the most incarcerated country in the world making us the safest country in the world? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=269.88s)]
*  And it's not. It's not making us the safest country in the world. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=283.0s)]
*  So let's think about how we can actually make our communities safer, but also keep families together, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  spend our communities resources on something other than locking people up, focus those resources on investing in the community, making it stronger, more edified, more healthy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  And so when I talk about having more freedom in this country, not incarcerating so many people, I'm also at the same time talking about, well, let's think about what we could do with those resources instead of locking people up. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=308.67999999999995s)]
*  So we go to communities and talk with them about what they would do with that money if they if they weren't spending so much on locking people up, things like investing in more affordable housing, investing in mental health care, investing in health care in general. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  All these things that would make our communities better investing in education, pre K education, all these things that are proven to give kids a better opportunity to have a better life, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=340.23999999999995s)]
*  make make it less likely that they end up getting in trouble as they get older. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=351.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, all of these things that are proven to work, we've got to invest in them and divest from the system of punishment and incarceration that we've built up. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  So for you, it's something you read about, you realize you're campaigning on. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=366.91999999999996s)]
*  And and at the same time, I should clarify, my family's had a lot of experience with the criminal justice system as well. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=370.96s)]
*  I've had relatives who've gone to jail, gone to prison. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=378.08000000000004s)]
*  And one of the things that got me involved in this conversation was thinking about what it's like for people when they get out of prison, because I had close family members and close friends who had to come back home after spending some time in prison. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=382.68s)]
*  And your mother was my mother went to jail for a time. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=396.36s)]
*  But I've had relatives who spent multiple years in prison and how difficult it was for them to reintegrate into society because society put all these barriers in front of them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=400.08s)]
*  There's a stigma, right? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=411.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's a stigma, but it's also legal barriers. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  So it's harder to apply for a job. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  It's harder to get housing, harder to get all kinds of things that you need to be a part of society, harder to vote. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=418.64s)]
*  We've done some work to mitigate that and change that over the years. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=425.4s)]
*  But when we started Free America, there were still a lot of places where you couldn't vote, you couldn't get housing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=429.52s)]
*  There were all sorts of barriers in their way. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=436.71999999999997s)]
*  And we, along with all the other folks we collaborate with, activists, including a lot of people who were formerly incarcerated, who are activists in this area. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=438.52s)]
*  We've helped reduce some of those barriers. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=448.32s)]
*  Did you ever, when you were stepping out to do this, because you are an award winning singer, songwriter, you're a musician. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=450.6s)]
*  Now you're putting your foot into a controversial public policy area. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=456.88s)]
*  And there's this stigma. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=461.64s)]
*  You're mentioning family members, you're mentioning your mother, you're mentioning other people. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=463.2s)]
*  Are you worried about how that's going to affect you, your family, your friends? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=466.68s)]
*  Well, I believe I'm fighting for my family. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=472.76s)]
*  I'm fighting for my community. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=475.36s)]
*  Thinking about ways that we can make their lives better, but also so many other families' lives better. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=477.52s)]
*  And I'm happy to do it because I feel like it's important for me to use this platform to do something that's actually going to make a difference in people's lives. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=484.24s)]
*  And I really feel like we're doing that. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  So let's talk about some of the stuff you're doing. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=495.36s)]
*  You mentioned the freedom that people come when they get out of being incarcerated. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=496.92s)]
*  But there's also pre-trial freedom, the debate over putting people away as they sit in jail for months and months before their trials, poorer people. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=501.16s)]
*  And your organization, Free America, launched a new initiative this year called Gathering for Freedom, which is about changing the narrative, pointing to stories of real people. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=508.96s)]
*  Because, you know, the New York Post and some of the right-wing media love to talk about somebody out on the street. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=517.16s)]
*  Tell us some of those stories. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=522.08s)]
*  Well, we had our gathering actually right here in our house at our dining table, and we welcomed people who had been affected by reform. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=523.36s)]
*  So, you know, a lot of times you'll get the negative stories you'll hear, you know, in the New York Post or in any of these outlets who want to sensationalize crime. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=532.8399999999999s)]
*  They'll say, well, this person got out because of bail reform and then they went off and did this. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=542.8s)]
*  But what doesn't get covered is all the success stories of bail reform. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=547.8s)]
*  People who got to go back to work, people who got to spend time with their family, be a good mother or father to their family, and their lives weren't disrupted by wasting away in jail before they were ever convicted of a crime. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=552.0s)]
*  And to be clear, when we say that we need bail reform, what we're saying is people should not be locked up solely because they're poor. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=565.76s)]
*  And under the old system, basically, if you couldn't afford a certain amount of money, it could be $500, it could be $1,000, it could be $2,000. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=575.84s)]
*  You would languish in jail before you were ever convicted of any crime. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=586.24s)]
*  And sometimes people are waiting literally years for their trial to happen. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  And the only reason they're there is because they can't afford the amount that the judge asked them to pay. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  And a lot of times it's not a large amount for most middle to upper middle class people. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=603.68s)]
*  But if you're poor, it is a lot of money for you. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=609.56s)]
*  And you're languishing in jail because you're poor. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=613.28s)]
*  And so the folks who are fighting for reform, including myself and my organization, we're saying nobody should be locked up because they're poor. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=616.24s)]
*  Now, if there's a reason that they're dangerous, if they're a flight risk. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=624.64s)]
*  But not because they can't pay the amount. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=627.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=629.28s)]
*  So on that note, as you talk about bail reform, and you're right, it criminalizes poor people in many ways. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=630.3199999999999s)]
*  It's a two tier system. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=636.16s)]
*  I also can't help but think about this state we're in. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  We're in California right now, where Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has been ordering cities, especially L.A., to clear out homeless camps. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=639.4799999999999s)]
*  It's a controversial move. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=646.0s)]
*  People are arguing about it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=647.16s)]
*  Some people, his critics say he is effectively criminalizing poverty, homelessness. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=648.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm curious what you make of that policy, given the position you're coming from on this. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=652.8399999999999s)]
*  I believe using our jail system to solve our housing problem is not going to work. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=657.2800000000001s)]
*  So hopefully, Governor Newsom isn't planning to use our jails as a way of fixing the homelessness problem. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think a lot of times we talk about homelessness in terms of kind of the cosmetic issue that people have. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=670.6s)]
*  They don't like seeing it. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=680.2800000000001s)]
*  And it lays our, you know, our social problems bare to the whole community when they see these folks in encampments in certain areas around town. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  And, you know, I understand that. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=692.64s)]
*  But what it really is, is a housing issue. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=696.0s)]
*  And the only way to solve the housing issue is making sure we have enough supply of housing and supply of affordable housing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=699.0s)]
*  And that's what California needs to do. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=708.0s)]
*  And that's what any city or state that's dealing with this issue needs to do, is build more housing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=711.16s)]
*  That's why I'm glad Vice President Harris, as part of her economic plan for the country, has said we need to find a way to build three million more new units. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=716.92s)]
*  Yep. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=727.56s)]
*  Because in the communities where there's a large unhoused population, the biggest issue is making sure there's more affordable housing. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=729.0s)]
*  And we need to build it to make that happen. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=736.4399999999999s)]
*  It sounds so obvious. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=738.24s)]
*  And yeah, people argue. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=740.04s)]
*  John, your organization, Free America, is also focused on local elections, DA races, ballot initiatives. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=740.88s)]
*  Currently you have George Gasco and the LADA district attorney. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  He's a progressive, up for reelection. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=749.8s)]
*  You, of course, endorsed him back in 2020. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=752.12s)]
*  I've interviewed the man. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=755.8s)]
*  Very knowledgeable, clever, passionate man. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=757.16s)]
*  But he has a lot of critics. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=759.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=760.36s)]
*  A lot of people who say, not just on the right, in the center, who say his progressive approach doesn't tackle crime, violent crime. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=760.68s)]
*  Tell us your view. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=767.1999999999999s)]
*  Why is it so important for you for him to remain in office? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=768.12s)]
*  Well, I will be supporting George Gasco again for reelection. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=770.36s)]
*  And I believe he has a really well balanced policy. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  He understands that certain people need to be incarcerated, that violent criminals need to be taken off the street. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=779.12s)]
*  And his prosecution rate hasn't gone down from the previous prosecutor when it comes to those kinds of crimes. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=785.6s)]
*  But he also realizes that we can't use our jails as the solution to every problem in our community. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=791.8000000000001s)]
*  And we need more mental health facilities. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=797.72s)]
*  We need diversions from jail when it's when it makes sense and when the crime calls for it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=799.48s)]
*  So they think about each case individually and try to make the best decision for that case, but also for the community. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=808.24s)]
*  And so I believe that's a really balanced approach. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=815.24s)]
*  And there's a lot of myths about his approach. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=818.1600000000001s)]
*  One is that he's not prosecuting, you know, all these crimes that are happening in the community. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=821.5600000000001s)]
*  And like I said, his prosecution rate is the same as his predecessor when it comes to those crimes. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=828.2s)]
*  But he also realizes the jail can't be the solution to every problem. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=832.84s)]
*  Jails are really expensive to maintain and we can't overcrowd them because that causes all sorts of problems. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=837.0s)]
*  So we have to be smart about using jails for their purpose and not overusing them when other solutions could actually work. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  You work with you support a lot of progressive DAs across the country, obviously. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=851.8s)]
*  So I'm curious to know, what is your reaction when time and again, the right tries to attack these people, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=856.12s)]
*  these progressive prosecutors as evil, liberal, George Soros backed prosecutors? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=862.64s)]
*  I mean, it's an absurd argument, frankly, it's a little anti-Semitic. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=869.9200000000001s)]
*  What do you make of that when you hear this? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=873.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm sure you hear all the time because you're in that space Soros, Soros, Soros. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=874.72s)]
*  Well, I'm grateful that George Soros and his foundation have done so much to try to make this country more just and more free. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=877.32s)]
*  And I don't see that as an epithet to say that George Soros is behind something, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=886.0s)]
*  because when I look at the causes that he's aligned himself with and his his organization has aligned himself with, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=891.0400000000001s)]
*  I tend to agree with the priorities that they've set and I'm appreciative of all the investment they've made into making this country more free and more just. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=897.6s)]
*  If someone views it as an epithet, then they need to check their own anti-Semitism or whatever biases they're bringing to it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=908.48s)]
*  But I'm very appreciative of some of the investments that his organization has made. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=915.96s)]
*  And we've collaborated or at least communicated on a lot of these progressive prosecutors. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=920.4s)]
*  And I'm so proud to have been supportive of these prosecutors and will continue to do so. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=926.48s)]
*  And we have to be careful with our with journalists and with how these stories are told, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=932.76s)]
*  because crime went up all over the country during the pandemic. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=939.64s)]
*  Whether there was a progressive prosecutor, whether there was not a progressive prosecutor, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  it went up all over the country and now it's going back down. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=949.4s)]
*  So all these breathless reports by these news organizations about how it went up, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=952.2s)]
*  I would hope they would devote the same amount of energy to talking about how it's going down all over the country now. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=958.52s)]
*  And use your critical thinking to say, well, if it's gone up, whether there was a progressive DA or not, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=964.5600000000001s)]
*  and if it's gone up all over the country and now it's going down all over the country, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=972.88s)]
*  then we need to re-examine who we're blaming things on. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=977.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=981.28s)]
*  Sadly, I don't think many media organizations will do that, but we will. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  That's why we're doing this interview. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=985.2s)]
*  Let me ask you, coming up also is Proposition 36 in California, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=987.04s)]
*  which will reclassify certain theft and drug misdemeanors as felonies and impose harsher sentences. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=990.64s)]
*  Critics say it's a return to kind of Richard Nixon's war on drugs. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=995.5600000000001s)]
*  The supporters say, well, you know, it's the only way to solve the fentanyl crisis. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1000.04s)]
*  What do you make of those arguments? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1003.52s)]
*  Are you worried that the right is using the very genuine fentanyl crisis to basically bring back a war on drugs? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1004.96s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of this still has to do with the rising crime during the pandemic. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1011.24s)]
*  And so I just want us all to be careful that we're not making big policy change decisions [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1016.96s)]
*  based on that really unique period in American history, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1023.36s)]
*  a once in a century pandemic that caused a swelling crime, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1029.76s)]
*  it caused so much social displacement and all kinds of things. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1033.04s)]
*  I just don't want us to make big long term decisions that will take us back to an era of mass incarceration [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1037.72s)]
*  based on a once in a century pandemic. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1045.1200000000001s)]
*  There are some good initiatives on the ballot in California, I believe. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1048.16s)]
*  Proposition 6 would permanently ban forced prison labor, essentially slavery. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1050.92s)]
*  In other words, by amending the state constitution, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1056.8s)]
*  you, of course, made the comparison with slavery in your 2015 Oscar speech. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1059.04s)]
*  How major would it be if this passed in California? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  And why is this type of effectively slavery gone unnoticed for so long? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1065.6s)]
*  Well, you know, my friend Ava DuVernay made a great docu-series on Netflix called The 13th, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1070.08s)]
*  which really connected that amendment to legalized slavery in America. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1076.4s)]
*  And I think the bottom line, the principle that we should all be following is no one should be forced to work. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1083.36s)]
*  It should be voluntary. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1090.6s)]
*  And there are plenty of folks who are incarcerated who will voluntarily work, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1092.6s)]
*  but they should not be forced to do so. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1096.6799999999998s)]
*  And just covering a lot, you do a lot of stuff. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1099.36s)]
*  So I'm just going to get across some of the stuff you do. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1102.1599999999999s)]
*  In 2020, you advocated for the passage of Proposition 17, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1104.28s)]
*  which won and gave 50,000 Californians nearly their right to vote. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1107.52s)]
*  People who had finished their prison sentences have been got out of incarceration. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1111.72s)]
*  Now you all believe you're working with the California Secretary of State. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1115.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1118.12s)]
*  Help get those people make sure they're on the back, make sure they're registered. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1118.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, we want to educate people because a lot of people don't realize they're eligible to vote. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1120.88s)]
*  Some of them who are actually even in jails right now are able to vote. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1125.48s)]
*  And these are expansions of rights. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1129.16s)]
*  And so... [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1131.4s)]
*  But you're doing it in blue California. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1132.4s)]
*  Meanwhile, in places like red Florida, DeSantis going out of his way, governor there, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1134.0s)]
*  to stop people who have got their right back. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1137.44s)]
*  Oh, trust me, we're not giving up on Florida either. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1139.2800000000002s)]
*  We had a lot to do with helping get that amendment passed in Florida [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1141.68s)]
*  to secure voting rights for people with felony records. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1146.0800000000002s)]
*  And then Governor DeSantis and the state legislature did some, you know, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1149.52s)]
*  trickery to try to roll back those rights that the people of Florida overwhelmingly voted for. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1156.16s)]
*  So we have to do our best to educate the population in Florida to make sure they know their rights [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1162.0s)]
*  and then also help people pay their fines and fees, which we've raised money to do so. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1167.92s)]
*  And so... [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1173.3999999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they won't even tell the people how much money they owe. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1174.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1176.16s)]
*  The system is very opaque. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1177.16s)]
*  It's hard for people to know whether they're eligible or not. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1181.0s)]
*  And they like that because they... [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1183.4s)]
*  Governor DeSantis likes that and people who are against voting rights like that. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1186.0s)]
*  I'm going to blunt the question. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1189.0s)]
*  Why do you think Republicans are so hell bent on not letting formerly incarcerated people vote? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1190.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, they're afraid they're going to vote more for Democrats. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1195.68s)]
*  They're afraid, you know, demographically that they're more likely to vote for Democrats, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1198.3200000000002s)]
*  even though there are a lot of people who would vote for Republicans [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  who have a felony record. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1205.88s)]
*  The thing is, felonies cover quite a range. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1208.1200000000001s)]
*  A lot of felonies are nonviolent. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1212.3200000000002s)]
*  They're pretty minor offenses, but they've been, by statute, called felonies. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1213.96s)]
*  And so you have quite a range of people who have committed felonies. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1218.5200000000002s)]
*  And that's why I also want progressives to be careful about this whole prosecutor versus [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1221.8000000000002s)]
*  felon language when they talk about Vice President Harris running against former President Trump, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1228.16s)]
*  because I work with people with felony convictions all the time, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1234.76s)]
*  and I fight for their right to reintegrate back into society, their right to vote. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1238.92s)]
*  And I don't want us to continue the idea of putting stigma on these folks and labeling them. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1243.4s)]
*  She has leaned into that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1249.76s)]
*  You know, I was... [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1250.8s)]
*  She hasn't really talked about him as a felon very much. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1251.52s)]
*  She talks about being a prosecutor and convicted. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1254.92s)]
*  But I've seen that language a lot by other progressives. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1256.4s)]
*  You know, DNC speech kind of leaned into it. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1259.28s)]
*  Yeah, but I think we should all be careful about demonizing people with a felony record, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1260.76s)]
*  because a lot of them just want to go back to work. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1266.44s)]
*  They want to vote. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1270.0s)]
*  They want to be a part of society again. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1270.84s)]
*  And if we continue that stigma, it's not healthy. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1272.84s)]
*  We're in such a weird world, aren't we, John? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1275.92s)]
*  Because of the Trump convictions. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1277.48s)]
*  And by the way, Donald Trump can vote in Florida because he was convicted in New York. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1278.8s)]
*  So there's a little loophole there that... [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1282.48s)]
*  Well, DeSantis had to personally allow him to vote. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1283.96s)]
*  I find fascinating. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1286.8s)]
*  But the weirdness is because of Trump's conviction now, you have Democrats, as you say, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1287.52s)]
*  leaning into he's a felon, we have a prosecutor as our candidate. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1291.68s)]
*  And then you have Republicans go around and say, the justice system is broken. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1295.32s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1298.16s)]
*  We have a topsy turvy world we're in right now. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1299.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's odd. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1301.72s)]
*  And, you know, President Trump acts like he's the victim of this rig system. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1303.12s)]
*  And he's a beneficiary of the rig system because he appointed some of the judges over his cases. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1308.08s)]
*  He is able to afford, you know, millions of dollars in legal fees that most people wouldn't be able to have. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1314.48s)]
*  And that's resulted in all sorts of delays and appeals and all sorts of lawyering that most people wouldn't even be able to afford. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1320.68s)]
*  You know, we talked to folks who are languishing in jail. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1328.0800000000002s)]
*  They can't get any time with the public defender. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1332.72s)]
*  They can't access any significant amount of quality legal counsel. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1335.16s)]
*  And that's really where the system's rigged. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1341.24s)]
*  And it's rigged against people without money, rigged against people without power. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1344.56s)]
*  And Donald Trump is on the opposite end of that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1349.32s)]
*  He's a beneficiary of the rig system. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1352.68s)]
*  Just going back to the prosecutor, Kamala Harris, you were one of the first celebrities to come out and endorse her after Joe Biden dropped out. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1355.16s)]
*  We'll talk about that in a second. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1363.1200000000001s)]
*  But just a lot of progressives, not a lot, but some progressives over the years have had an issue with some parts of her criminal justice record, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1364.24s)]
*  specifically here in California when she was San Francisco DA, California AG. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1372.44s)]
*  She did do a lot of good things in terms of promoting diversion programs for a lot of young people. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1377.0s)]
*  She did a lot of criminal justice reform. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1380.96s)]
*  But then people pointed out in some cases, she made people serve longer sentence than they needed to. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1382.76s)]
*  She resisted a lot of innocence claims by her office. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1388.52s)]
*  She helped overturn a court ruling that could have outlawed the death penalty in California. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1391.8799999999999s)]
*  How do you personally, when you look at someone like that in the round, how do you square that record of hers, which is mixed, as I say, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1395.6799999999998s)]
*  she did some good things, but she did some bad things with your Free America work and your how do you square that? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1401.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I believe that at a time when it wasn't particularly popular, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1407.28s)]
*  she was already implementing some progressive reforms that we now associate with the progressive prosecutor movement. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1411.84s)]
*  She was doing some of that work before it was popular, before people were talking about it. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1418.92s)]
*  And so I've seen her in a lot of ways as a pioneer when it came to being a progressive prosecutor. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1423.8400000000001s)]
*  Of course, I think as we've moved on and the movement has gained strength, we've had more and more progressive DAs. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1430.3200000000002s)]
*  They've been sharing practices, best practices with each other. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1437.76s)]
*  And the whole movement has moved forward. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1441.8000000000002s)]
*  But I think she was an early pioneer when it came to being smart on crime, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1444.12s)]
*  thinking more creatively about how to think about accountability and things like that, having more diversion programs. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1448.8s)]
*  I think she was ahead of her time compared to a lot of prosecutors during the time when she was serving as DA in Los Angeles. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1456.04s)]
*  And then once she was AG, it's a very different kind of job. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1464.04s)]
*  You're not dealing with the everyday crimes in the county and in the community. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1467.32s)]
*  You're doing big, big, more state level things like deciding to fight for California homeowners when they were duped by the banks, fighting for... [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1473.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not disputing she did a lot of good things. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1484.72s)]
*  I'm just saying there are things in her record that people on your side and your movement... [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1486.64s)]
*  But like I say, when I think about it holistically, I see her as ahead of the game when it came to being more progressive at the time when she was serving as a county DA. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1490.3200000000002s)]
*  And I think she still, after that, wasn't a local DA. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1501.0s)]
*  And so it's not a really fair comparison to what progressive DAs are doing right now. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1508.92s)]
*  When we spoke in 2020, we were talking about the Democratic primaries. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1514.92s)]
*  And you had said that no matter who the candidate was, I think you did endorse Senator Warren at the time, if memory serves me correctly, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1518.6s)]
*  progressives like yourself would continue to push whoever the Democratic presidential candidate ended up being, Joe Biden, towards more progress. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1523.64s)]
*  And I wonder what does that look like for you today with a candidate like Kamala Harris joining the race very late, later than any candidate in our lifetimes? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1529.76s)]
*  What are the things you are trying to push her towards? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1537.52s)]
*  Well, let's talk about some of the successes that progressives have had under the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1540.0s)]
*  I think one of them is getting such a huge climate bill passed. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, a bigger climate investment than any country has ever made in the history of the world was made by the Biden-Harris administration [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1549.64s)]
*  under the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1558.12s)]
*  And, you know, that's one of those areas where progressives were pushing. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1560.76s)]
*  You know, there was talk of the Green New Deal. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1565.12s)]
*  And this was kind of a watered down version of that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1567.1599999999999s)]
*  But it wouldn't exist without people pushing for the Green New Deal. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1569.28s)]
*  And so I think we need to take that as a win and say, this is what happens when we push. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1575.76s)]
*  And we may ask for more than they will actually achieve. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1581.04s)]
*  What are you pushing for in 2024? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1584.6s)]
*  In legislation. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1585.96s)]
*  But, you know, that push is going to result in actual wins. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1587.1200000000001s)]
*  And so I think we all need to think about how foreign policy is being waged because there's a lot of progressives that are concerned about Israel and Gaza and pushing our president and vice president on that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1591.2s)]
*  And so that's one area where we can push and hopefully get some results. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1606.2s)]
*  I think when it comes to things like the housing initiative that Vice President Harris has proposed, I think that's going to be really important for the strength of our communities when it comes to affordability and thinking about how to bring down prices all over the country. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1610.4s)]
*  Those are going to be important. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1625.0400000000002s)]
*  And I think these are things that progressives can push on. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1626.3200000000002s)]
*  And she's made some promises for and we can push to make sure she fulfills those promises. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1628.96s)]
*  I do want to come back to some of the stuff you mentioned in a moment. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1635.8000000000002s)]
*  But just while we're talking about Harris, you were at the DNC. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1637.76s)]
*  You performed at the DNC. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1640.76s)]
*  I was there. I saw you. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1641.84s)]
*  Very good. Thank you. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1642.8799999999999s)]
*  Very good. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1644.08s)]
*  People have said that there's a lot of joy and energy at the rallies. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1645.4s)]
*  The DNC was when she came on stage, it was a I was going to say Taylor Swift moment, but I'll say John Legend moment. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1649.32s)]
*  When she came on stage, there was a lot of energy. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1654.64s)]
*  And I was like, where am I? Am I at a Democratic convention or a rock concert? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1656.52s)]
*  Yes. And one congresswoman said to me there, she said, I'm worried about this energy because it feels like we've already won. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1659.84s)]
*  And are you worried that Democrats, is there a complacency? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1665.36s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1668.96s)]
*  I think Democrats are not guilty of resting. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1669.56s)]
*  How did you feel on stage when you were at the DNC? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1677.24s)]
*  I think everyone's genuinely excited, but I think they have had enough experience where they thought they were going to win, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1679.24s)]
*  like, especially with Hillary, I think in 2016, like, I think we all thought we were going to win. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1685.28s)]
*  And so I think none of us are really guilty of irrational exuberance here. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1690.68s)]
*  I think we all know it's tough and we all know the swing states are extremely close, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1696.16s)]
*  that we could win the national popular vote by two or three points and still lose the election. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1700.92s)]
*  And so I think nobody's taking anything for granted. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1707.0s)]
*  And you can tell Vice President Harris's campaign is not taking anything for granted there in all these swing states and they're doing the work. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1709.76s)]
*  And what I love about the excitement is it means more volunteers. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1718.6399999999999s)]
*  It means more people signing up to vote. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1722.76s)]
*  You saw, you know, even with Taylor Swift, when she posted the link to vote.org or vote.gov, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1724.76s)]
*  there was a huge influx of new registrants and people finding out how they could register to vote. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1733.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think all of that is fed by the excitement. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  And that excitement can translate to actual real numbers of people registering and people voting. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1743.08s)]
*  And that those volunteers can help do that too, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1748.52s)]
*  when they're convincing their community members, their family members, their friends to go out and vote too. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1751.8s)]
*  I want to come back to a couple of things you've mentioned already. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1756.76s)]
*  I'm going to bring up before I wrap up this section. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1758.84s)]
*  This summer after Joe Biden's, I think we can all agree, disastrous debate performance, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1761.44s)]
*  George Clooney, longtime Democratic donor, called on President Joe Biden publicly in The New York Times to drop out of the race. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1765.3600000000001s)]
*  It had a huge impact to the point where the Biden people were criticizing Clooney off the record. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1771.6s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, you, like George Clooney, have had a long association with the party. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1775.92s)]
*  Did you think at that time, I should come out and say something to you? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1781.0800000000002s)]
*  Were you thinking at that time he should step aside? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1783.7600000000002s)]
*  What was going on with you back then? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1785.64s)]
*  And there's a lot of discussions going on, everyone publicly. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1787.24s)]
*  I was involved in some discussions and they were private discussions that, you know, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1789.72s)]
*  me being a surrogate in the campaign and having a relationship with a lot of the leaders of the campaign, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1795.3600000000001s)]
*  we had conversations and they were private. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1803.68s)]
*  And I felt for me, it was better for them to remain private. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1805.8400000000001s)]
*  And I'm very happy with the decision that President Biden made, because I think we needed that as a party, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1810.64s)]
*  as a country, a new infusion of energy, a generational change in our leadership. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1819.2s)]
*  And I think he made a great decision for the country. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1824.76s)]
*  It was a really difficult decision for him. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1829.8s)]
*  It was a big sacrifice. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1832.24s)]
*  Most politicians just would not do. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1833.28s)]
*  And I continue to admire him as a person of high character and integrity and patriotism. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1835.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think he did the patriotic thing. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1842.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think it was also wise the way he immediately tapped Vice President Harris to get the nomination. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1844.96s)]
*  She had to still go out and earn it. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1855.8400000000001s)]
*  But I think his statement made it much easier for that to happen more quickly. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1857.36s)]
*  And it was executed pretty flawlessly. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1863.4799999999998s)]
*  Democrat in a ray, not in disarray. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1868.36s)]
*  It was executed very flawlessly. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1870.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think it set Vice President Harris up for success in the best way possible. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1871.84s)]
*  So generational change on the Democratic Party side. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1877.52s)]
*  Republicans are going with the same guy they went with in 2020 and 2016. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1880.6s)]
*  Donald J. Trump, who you called out a couple of weeks ago for spreading, quote, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1885.08s)]
*  hateful, xenophobic, racist lies, you said, during his debate with Kamala Harris. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1889.1599999999999s)]
*  He, of course, falsely accused Haitian migrants of eating pets ridiculously offensively in Springfield, Ohio, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1893.2s)]
*  which is your hometown. My hometown. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1899.28s)]
*  And you were you were in the state performing that night, I believe. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1901.08s)]
*  What was the reaction from people in the community at the time around you? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1903.96s)]
*  How worried were you for people in that state in places like Springfield? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1907.8s)]
*  I mean, there's been something like 30 bomb threats against this one city since then. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1912.44s)]
*  Right. So just to, you know, give you the tick tock of how it went down, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1915.96s)]
*  I was on stage in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is about 90 minutes from Springfield. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1920.44s)]
*  I have a lot of family who lives in Springfield still. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1925.68s)]
*  My mother lives there. My two younger siblings live there. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1927.8400000000001s)]
*  So I'm very connected to the city still have so much family. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1931.6000000000001s)]
*  They're our own property there. Pay property taxes there. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1935.76s)]
*  And then I was on stage not very far from there during the debate. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1938.72s)]
*  And I get off stage and, you know, a lot of my friends who are watching the debate [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1944.92s)]
*  knew I was from Springfield and were like, yo, your hometown. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1949.04s)]
*  It's trending. It's trending. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1953.96s)]
*  For all the wrong reasons. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1955.44s)]
*  And, you know, there are a lot of jokes about, you know, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1957.0s)]
*  did we all eat cats and eat dogs while we were there? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1961.0800000000002s)]
*  But. Once you kind of get the jokes out of the way and the memes out of the way, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1964.32s)]
*  you realize this man is doing what he's always done. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1970.8s)]
*  He's maligning black and brown people. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1974.2s)]
*  He's causing division and stirring up hate and using people's [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1977.32s)]
*  fear as a weapon to aid his campaign. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1984.04s)]
*  And he's used that same playbook time and time again. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1989.28s)]
*  And he does not care about the welfare of the people of Springfield, Ohio, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=1994.48s)]
*  because if he did, he wouldn't spread these false rumors. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2000.52s)]
*  He would be advocating for them to have the resources they need to make sure that [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2004.48s)]
*  our Haitian immigrants are able to assimilate and have legal immigrants. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2010.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're all legal immigrants. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2016.68s)]
*  And so we need a leader who actually cares about the people and won't spread these lies [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2018.36s)]
*  and rumors just for their own campaign benefit. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2024.4799999999998s)]
*  Are Donald Trump and JD Vance inciting violence here? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2027.7199999999998s)]
*  Are they inciting domestic terrorism? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2030.8s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump has since he has started running for office, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2032.24s)]
*  there's always been the incitement of violence in his rallies, in his speeches. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2037.24s)]
*  Obviously, January 6th was probably the most visible manifestation and [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2043.36s)]
*  drastic manifestation of that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2049.36s)]
*  But he talks about it all the time. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2050.96s)]
*  30 bomb threats. This is domestic terrorism. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2054.36s)]
*  If I did it, you did it, it would be a real problem. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2056.36s)]
*  And you watch some of the language he uses about immigrants, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2058.44s)]
*  particularly about them poisoning our blood, about them invading the country. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2062.56s)]
*  He paints them in such stark, vicious terms that it would influence someone to be violent [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2068.56s)]
*  toward them if they took his words to heart. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2075.84s)]
*  And that's why you're seeing bomb threats in Springfield. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2078.68s)]
*  That's why you're seeing violence toward our Haitian brothers and sisters, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2081.56s)]
*  Muslim brothers and sisters, Jewish brothers and sisters. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2087.64s)]
*  You're seeing this kind of violence because not only Donald Trump, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2090.48s)]
*  but his movement has encouraged demonization of the other in such a way that it incites violence. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2094.0s)]
*  And yet a new poll from the NAACP suggests one in four black men, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2102.8s)]
*  younger black men, are considering voting for Donald Trump. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2108.24s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2110.64s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2112.48s)]
*  I always make sure we clarify what's happening in the black community. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2115.36s)]
*  We are less likely to vote for Donald Trump than any other community. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2118.96s)]
*  So even if his support goes up from 15 to 18 percent, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  it's a change and it could matter in a really close state. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2130.88s)]
*  But bottom line is we are overwhelmingly going to vote for Kamala Harris, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2136.2000000000003s)]
*  more so than any other ethnic group, any other demographic group in the country. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2140.44s)]
*  And so to the extent there are a few folks that are attracted by his message of bravado [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2145.48s)]
*  and rumors that he's the one that gave them all the money they got during the pandemic [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2152.36s)]
*  and with the stimulus check, whether there's a few of those folks in our community [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2159.32s)]
*  that are going to be kind of duped by some of this campaigning and rhetoric, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2164.36s)]
*  that may be the case. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2173.56s)]
*  But the bottom line is I think the vast majority of us see right through his BS [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2175.0s)]
*  and will not be voting for him. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2181.56s)]
*  I want to ask a personal question about him and Vance, if you don't mind. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2183.08s)]
*  This past July, after Trump selected Vance, JD Vance's running mate, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2185.96s)]
*  there was an old clip of Vance that resurfaced from 2021, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2189.4s)]
*  him criticizing Kamala Harris for not having any children of her own. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2192.36s)]
*  A lot of people were outraged by this naturally, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2196.44s)]
*  including families who've had kids through non-traditional means [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2198.7599999999998s)]
*  or who maybe lost a child due to pregnancy complications. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2201.48s)]
*  You yourself have had a child who was born through a surrogate. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2205.16s)]
*  You and Chrissy suffered very sadly pregnancy complications back in 2020, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2207.7999999999997s)]
*  which led to the loss of your son, Jack. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2212.12s)]
*  You've been very open about that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2214.2799999999997s)]
*  And I just wonder what was your family's reaction when you hear [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2215.7999999999997s)]
*  a man running for vice president talk about childless people in this way? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2218.84s)]
*  You know, I just don't understand this contempt he has for people without children. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2223.4s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2230.2s)]
*  There's all kinds of reasons why people might not have kids. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2232.36s)]
*  And a lot of them are things they didn't choose. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2235.08s)]
*  But sometimes people choose not to have kids. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2237.64s)]
*  And we don't want the government dictating to us when we have kids [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2241.0s)]
*  and how many kids we're able to have. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2246.2799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I think what a lot of people don't think about [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2248.12s)]
*  when it comes to abortion laws is that to enforce abortion laws, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2252.7599999999998s)]
*  it requires a level of surveillance that nobody wants. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2259.48s)]
*  You know, they even talk about monitoring people's menstrual cycles. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2265.72s)]
*  Vance wants police to follow women out of state. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2270.36s)]
*  Yes, following them out of state. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2272.68s)]
*  You know, you have to know a lot about someone to know if they're within the six weeks [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2275.96s)]
*  or within the 15 weeks or this or that. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2280.68s)]
*  You have to know so much private information about someone to enforce it. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2283.0s)]
*  And to enforce it as a criminal statute, that involves the police, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2287.4s)]
*  that involves a district attorney. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2293.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're back to justice. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2295.16s)]
*  And can you imagine, like, a conversation that's supposed to be between you and your OBGYN [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2296.2799999999997s)]
*  involving the police and the district attorney in your community? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2305.24s)]
*  As soon as you make abortion illegal in that way, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2309.7999999999997s)]
*  you're inviting all these people into that conversation. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2312.92s)]
*  And none of them deserve to be there. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2315.8799999999997s)]
*  And this is the party that's a small government party. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2317.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2319.4s)]
*  All right, let's talk about something you've alluded to [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2320.2799999999997s)]
*  a couple of times in this conversation. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2322.44s)]
*  You mentioned foreign policy earlier. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2323.96s)]
*  You mentioned the swing states. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2325.56s)]
*  Despite all of Trump's awfulness and Vance's awfulness, they could still very easily win. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2328.28s)]
*  The electoral college gives them a very good chance in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2332.04s)]
*  I've been to Georgia recently. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2336.76s)]
*  I know you have too. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2337.88s)]
*  I went to Pennsylvania just the other day. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2339.0s)]
*  I speak to a lot of people in Michigan, in Dearborn, Detroit. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2341.88s)]
*  I'm Muslim American. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2345.2400000000002s)]
*  I speak to a lot of Muslim Americans, Arab Americans, people of color, black pastors in Georgia, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2346.04s)]
*  all of whom are outraged about what's happening in Gaza. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2350.6s)]
*  A lot of them are saying, we're going to sit down. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2353.3199999999997s)]
*  We're not going to vote Trump. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2354.68s)]
*  We're going to stay home. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2355.56s)]
*  Or we'll vote green. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2356.7599999999998s)]
*  We'll vote third party. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2357.72s)]
*  How, I mean, you shared a New York Times op-ed earlier this year on social media [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2359.56s)]
*  from my friend Daniel Levy calling for a reset on Gaza from the administration. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2362.92s)]
*  Does Kamala Harris need to break from Biden on this issue? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2367.64s)]
*  Do something different? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2370.7599999999998s)]
*  Policy wise, she's done better, I think, rhetorically. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2371.7999999999997s)]
*  I think we can all agree. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2373.96s)]
*  Does she need to do something better on policy? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2375.24s)]
*  Signal that she will be different, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2377.08s)]
*  especially to win a key state like Michigan? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2379.08s)]
*  I do believe so. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2381.16s)]
*  And I really think it really revolves around the idea of accountability [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2382.12s)]
*  and using our aid to Israel as leverage. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2386.36s)]
*  I don't think we should be writing blank checks to any country that we're allied with. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2390.84s)]
*  And that any kind of assistance we provide, any kind of weapons we send, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2397.16s)]
*  should come with conditions. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2402.04s)]
*  And I think that's a very sensible way to conduct foreign policy. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2403.56s)]
*  And we do it just about everywhere else. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2408.04s)]
*  So let's do it there too. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2410.2799999999997s)]
*  And in the summer, in May, actually, you collaborated on an Instagram post [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2412.12s)]
*  with Save the Children calling for a definitive ceasefire in Gaza [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2416.12s)]
*  and a release of the hostages, which we all want. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2419.48s)]
*  You said you and Chrissie had donated, I think, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2421.64s)]
*  100 grand each to the charity for Gaza. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2423.16s)]
*  How devastating has it been for you both as parents [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2425.72s)]
*  to see how many kids have been killed in Gaza? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2428.7599999999998s)]
*  At least 16,000, probably more. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2432.04s)]
*  Thousands more have limbs amputated. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2434.2799999999997s)]
*  Some of them have come to the US for treatment. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2437.08s)]
*  I'm a parent, you're a parent. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2439.3199999999997s)]
*  Forget the politics. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2440.6s)]
*  Just seeing what's happened to children. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2441.72s)]
*  What's that been like for the last year for you? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2443.16s)]
*  I know you spend time on social media like we all do. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2445.08s)]
*  It's stunning to see it. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2447.3199999999997s)]
*  And it also makes me very frustrated how easily we dehumanize certain people [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2448.92s)]
*  based on where they live, the color of their skin, their religion. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2462.68s)]
*  Whether or not they're allies with our country. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2467.48s)]
*  No matter what political disagreements and political animus and anger we have [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2471.72s)]
*  at Hamas and the leadership in Gaza, those kids are innocent. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2479.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2484.2s)]
*  And I don't believe in collective punishment. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2484.7599999999998s)]
*  And I believe that their lives are just as valuable, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2488.36s)]
*  just as valuable as Israeli lives or any other lives. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2491.72s)]
*  And so I want foreign policy to be conducted with that in mind. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2496.6s)]
*  I want philanthropy to be conducted with that in mind. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2501.3199999999997s)]
*  And I want our news coverage of the situation to be conducted with that in mind. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2505.64s)]
*  That these lives are just as valuable as any other lives around the world. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2510.68s)]
*  And that means when we cover them, when we cover the stories, we center their humanity. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2514.36s)]
*  And we don't just kind of gloss over it with just numbers, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2523.16s)]
*  but we center their humanity just like we centered the humanity of the festival goers in Israel. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2526.44s)]
*  And they were just there to enjoy some music. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2533.88s)]
*  And it was horrific what was done to them. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2536.68s)]
*  But it's also horrific for kids to get bombed in Gaza. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2539.32s)]
*  It is absolutely horrific. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2542.52s)]
*  And so we need to, as a society, as a world, equate those lives, equate the value of those lives. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2544.28s)]
*  I 100% agree and well-spoken, and you said about dehumanization. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2553.0s)]
*  And you're somebody who's tried to humanize Palestinians for a while. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2556.36s)]
*  I remember watching you on Bill Ma several years ago come out on this, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2559.48s)]
*  long before it was fashionable in Hollywood. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2563.64s)]
*  But a lot of your fellow celebs, artists won't touch this issue with a barge pole. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2565.32s)]
*  Despite the suffering we're all seeing in Gaza, we all agree, as you just very eloquently put it, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2570.92s)]
*  what happened on October 7th was horrific, innocent people killed. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2575.64s)]
*  But when it comes, we can all say that, right? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2579.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2581.08s)]
*  Happily. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2581.24s)]
*  When it comes to Gaza, we're not all willing to say that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2581.7999999999997s)]
*  And I just wonder, you're here in LA and Hollywood, you're a prominent figure. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2584.12s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2587.16s)]
*  Why do you think so many people just don't want to touch this issue with a barge pole? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2587.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, they've seen people get punished for it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2590.7599999999998s)]
*  They've seen people lose their agent or lose jobs from it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2593.4799999999996s)]
*  And I think some people are afraid of that possibility. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2598.3599999999997s)]
*  They're afraid they'll suffer professional consequences. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2601.3199999999997s)]
*  No, I'm not afraid. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2605.0s)]
*  One, I believe in what I'm saying. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2606.8399999999997s)]
*  I feel like what I just said, who disagrees with what I just said? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2608.84s)]
*  What about it? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2613.96s)]
*  It's a case. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2614.6000000000004s)]
*  It is. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2614.92s)]
*  Touche. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2617.32s)]
*  I would love for someone to come to me and say why what I just said was immoral, anti-Semitic, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2621.0800000000004s)]
*  anything, because it's not. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2626.92s)]
*  Anyone who's being reasonable knows it's not. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2630.0400000000004s)]
*  But I understand why people might be afraid to talk about these issues [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2633.1600000000003s)]
*  because of professional consequences. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2637.48s)]
*  But also, I think we all, and I have humility when I talk about this issue, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2638.92s)]
*  because I don't know it as well as I know a lot of the ins and outs of what's going on [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2643.32s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2648.12s)]
*  I know what it means to be an American. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2649.16s)]
*  I understand our system very well. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2650.68s)]
*  I understand our history very well. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2652.28s)]
*  And honestly, I don't know nearly as much about what's going on in Israel and Palestine, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2654.84s)]
*  all the back and forth of the negotiations that have happened over the last few decades. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2662.28s)]
*  So sometimes we should make sure that those of us who aren't real experts on it [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2668.44s)]
*  have some humility about what we know and what we don't know. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2673.8s)]
*  Fair point. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2676.52s)]
*  And one of the things I keep as a rule for myself is [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2676.92s)]
*  I don't want to post something that I couldn't answer a follow-up question about. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2681.2400000000002s)]
*  And so let's make sure if we're going to weigh in on things, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2685.08s)]
*  that we do the work to prepare ourselves to answer a follow-up question on it. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2689.08s)]
*  You are being humble because you do know more than most on this issue. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2694.36s)]
*  So we appreciate you for that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2697.08s)]
*  And actually, every time I talk to you, John, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2698.36s)]
*  and I think this is our fourth conversation, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2700.52s)]
*  I ask you the same question. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2702.44s)]
*  When are you running for office? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2703.48s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2705.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2705.7200000000003s)]
*  You keep giving the same answer. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2706.04s)]
*  It hasn't changed. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2706.92s)]
*  It hasn't changed. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2707.64s)]
*  All right. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2708.28s)]
*  Well, the California Senate came and went and it's Adam Schiff. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2708.6800000000003s)]
*  Last question then. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2712.28s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2713.08s)]
*  Just before we finish, on a different note, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2714.12s)]
*  you have a new children's music album out, My Favorite Dream. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2715.7200000000003s)]
*  Chrissie and two of your kids are singing on the album. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2719.0s)]
*  I believe your daughter did the artwork for it. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2721.0s)]
*  How much fun was that? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2723.56s)]
*  A music album as a family affair? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2724.6s)]
*  I loved making this album. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2726.92s)]
*  I wrote all the songs right here in our home, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2728.6800000000003s)]
*  in the piano room that I sometimes go play in. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2732.28s)]
*  And I had never written an entire album by myself [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2735.88s)]
*  and I had never written an album at home. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2739.96s)]
*  I usually go to the studio. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2741.7200000000003s)]
*  I usually have co-writers. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2742.76s)]
*  So this was very personal for me. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2743.96s)]
*  It was very informed by all the messages we like to share with our kids [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2746.28s)]
*  to encourage them, to challenge them, to comfort them. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2750.04s)]
*  And it really was informed by our family life. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2754.28s)]
*  And I poured all of my heart into the songwriting [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2757.96s)]
*  in a way that I had never done before. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2760.92s)]
*  And so it was really a joy to make this album. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2763.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'm so excited that I could include the family on the album [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2767.5600000000004s)]
*  and make it a true family affair. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2771.48s)]
*  Brilliant. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2773.96s)]
*  Thank you so much, John. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2774.52s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2775.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHIkN8CeGl8&t=2775.8s)]
