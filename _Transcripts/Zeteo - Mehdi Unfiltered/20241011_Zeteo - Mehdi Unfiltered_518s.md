Video Description: On this episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered,’ Mehdi Hasan explains the Israeli military policy driving its campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon, named after a suburb of Beirut.

“The Dahiya doctrine calls for the Israeli military to intentionally, deliberately, cynically, inflict long-lasting and disproportionate damage onto the enemy, no matter how bad the civilian consequences,” Mehdi says. “Exactly what we’re seeing in Lebanon now, and in Gaza for the past year.”

Mehdi does a deep dive into the history behind the policy, which mainstream US media has failed to bring attention to.

# "The Dahiya Doctrine": Israel's ILLEGAL Military Plan For Flattening Lebanon And Gaza
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4)
*  Yaroon is a small but lively village filled with beautiful mosques and churches for the town's Greek Catholic and Shia Muslim population [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=0.0s)]
*  And even a religious shrine that both groups cherish [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  The town is historically known for harvesting delicious olives as well as wheat and tobacco [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=10.48s)]
*  And it's also believed to be a biblical town specifically the town of Yiron, which is mentioned in the book of Joshua [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=15.32s)]
*  But today Yaroon doesn't look like a small quaint town anymore. No instead it looks like this [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=21.92s)]
*  Yes, the small town in southern Lebanon has been completely flattened by Israeli airstrikes [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=29.14s)]
*  Which the Israelis say are targeted at Hezbollah, but which these pictures show is far from the truth [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=34.34s)]
*  Of course Israel's reckless indiscriminate assaults on Lebanese towns and cities don't stop at Yaroon or even southern Lebanon for that matter [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=39.9s)]
*  The region Israel constantly describes as a Hezbollah stronghold [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=47.5s)]
*  This past weekend Israel expanded their airstrike campaign into northern Lebanon striking a Palestinian refugee camp near Tripoli in an attack [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=51.699999999999996s)]
*  They claim was made to kill another Hamas leader, but which also reportedly killed his wife and two daughters [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  Israel has also destroyed several residential buildings filled with people in the Dahya suburb of Beirut [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=65.14s)]
*  Including the four apartment buildings that were struck with two thousand pound bombs three of which were completely flattened [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=70.78s)]
*  During Israel's recent assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=77.02s)]
*  Now Dahya interestingly is also the name given to Israel's military policy of disproportionately damaging and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  Indiscriminately bombing civilian areas to prove a point. Yes [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  It's an actual Israeli strategy and the name for it is the Dahya doctrine named after that Beirut suburb that Israel attacked [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=91.7s)]
*  Just recently but also that Israel flattened during their 2006 war with Hezbollah [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=98.26s)]
*  See the Dahya doctrine calls for the Israeli military to intentionally [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=103.54s)]
*  deliberately cynically [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=108.1s)]
*  Inflict long-lasting and disproportionate damage onto the enemy no matter how bad the civilian consequences [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=109.82s)]
*  Aka exactly what we're seeing in Lebanon now and in Gaza for the past year [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=116.58s)]
*  This strategy was established with the rather delusional belief that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=121.46s)]
*  Disproportionate force will somehow deter terrorists from attacking Israel again [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=125.46s)]
*  Which as we've seen from Israel's repeated use of the Dahya doctrine in their 2008 war with Hamas their 2012 war with Hamas their [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=129.7s)]
*  2014 war with Hamas is far from the case [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  Former Israeli military commander Gadi Eisenkot who was actually serving in Benjamin Netanyahu's war cabinet up until this June [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  Described the doctrine pretty openly pretty bluntly in 2008 saying quote. We will wield [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=148.38s)]
*  Disproportionate power against every village from which shots are fired on Israel and cause immense damage and destruction [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=154.1s)]
*  From our perspective these villages are military bases. He went on to say this isn't a suggestion [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=160.61999999999998s)]
*  This is an authorized plan a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=166.26s)]
*  Plan that by the way is a clear violation of international law as the principle of proportionality [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=169.06s)]
*  Clearly prohibits military attacks that could create an excessive loss of civilian life as well as an excessive damage to civilian infrastructure [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=174.22s)]
*  Nonetheless Israel's military was just as shameless back then as they are now applying the doctrine the Dahya doctrine in 2008-2009 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=182.86s)]
*  In Gaza during Operation car sled with a UN report later condemning Israel's Dahya doctrine calling their military strategy a quote a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=190.38000000000002s)]
*  Deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish humiliate and terrorize a civilian population [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=198.74s)]
*  radically diminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself and to force upon it an ever-increasing sense of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=204.34s)]
*  dependency and vulnerability [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=212.18s)]
*  That is how the UN described the Dahya doctrine and today [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=213.78s)]
*  Even with all the pressure from the ICJ and the ICC the Israeli government is just as blunt about their illegal military strategy [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=217.74s)]
*  Just take a look at what Israeli education minister [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=224.5s)]
*  Yoav Kish said a few weeks ago about Israel's military operation in Lebanon [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=226.5s)]
*  Now not only is that statement clearly genocidal in my view [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=247.82s)]
*  But it's also just a different iteration of what Israeli leaders were also saying back during Israel's [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=251.26s)]
*  2006 war with Lebanon in what were widely seen as [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=255.78s)]
*  Declarations of the Dahya doctrine Israeli Major General Udi Adam on the topic of military targets in Lebanon said in [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=259.26s)]
*  2006 and I quote once it is inside Lebanon everything is legitimate not just southern Lebanon not just the line of Hezbollah posts [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=266.02s)]
*  During that same time Israel's military chief of staff told Israel's Channel 10 television network that the country would quote turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=273.46s)]
*  Yes, even years after the doctrines obvious failure to deter either Hezbollah Hamas or even make Israel safer [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=282.22s)]
*  Israeli officials still continue to tout indiscriminate bombing and complete destruction as a reasonable military strategy [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=289.7s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is no better. Let's take a look at the message [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=297.3s)]
*  He put out on Tuesday to the people of Lebanon [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=300.8s)]
*  Don't let these terrorists destroy your future any more than they've already done [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Stand up and take your country back [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=308.12s)]
*  You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=310.36s)]
*  That would lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=315.56s)]
*  Watch out if you don't listen to us. We will attack you and make you suffer like the people of Gaza have suffered [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=319.68s)]
*  We will die here. You is what Netanyahu is openly and criminally saying [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=325.44s)]
*  What does that look like so far according to an Israeli official who spoke to CNN in just two days in September Israel carried out? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  3,000 strikes to give you an idea of just how excessive and how disproportionate that is during the US's 20-year war in Afghanistan [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=337.2s)]
*  The country carried out less than 3,000 strikes per year [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=344.12s)]
*  Which still was far too many in my view with over 2,000 Lebanese people already killed a majority in these past few weeks [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=347.96s)]
*  The current death toll is already surpassing the toll from Israel's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=354.4s)]
*  2006 war against Lebanon a war that human rights groups agreed was a grave violation of international law as Israel not only showed a quote [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=358.64s)]
*  reckless indifference to the fate of Lebanese civilians to quote Human Rights Watch but also deliberately tried to inflict a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=366.32s)]
*  disproportionate and excessive amount of suffering and damage [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=373.48s)]
*  Now you might think that a country boasting not just about [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=376.96s)]
*  disproportionately attacking its neighbor in clear violation of the law [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=381.48s)]
*  But also giving their illegal strategy a specific name [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=384.66s)]
*  That might get some coverage in the US media [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=388.62s)]
*  I mean the Israelis are not hiding their dahiya doctrine the Israeli media covers it and yet there's barely any mention of it in our [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=390.82s)]
*  Press the last time the New York Times published an article referencing the dahiya doctrine was ten years ago during Israel's 2014 war with Gaza [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=397.86s)]
*  With the article claiming that quote experts say the dahiya doctrine does not apply to Gaza [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=405.18s)]
*  Yes, because apparently over 1,400 people killed during that war was not excessive at all [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=410.34s)]
*  The LA Times published an article last November that briefly mentions the dahiya doctrine [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=415.65999999999997s)]
*  That is with zero mention of how it was obviously been applied in Gaza [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=420.09999999999997s)]
*  The Associated Press has also failed to explain just how illegal this doctrine is giving it a mere [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=424.46s)]
*  two-sentence mention in an article last month and a one-sentence mention in October last year [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=429.73999999999995s)]
*  In fact the only major US media outlet to dedicate a full article to the topic since Israel began its war on Gaza has been [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=435.5s)]
*  The Washington Post [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=442.94s)]
*  But that was nearly a year ago [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  And of course even when the Western media does give the dahiya doctrine a mention here or there [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=446.46s)]
*  They still refuse to describe what's happening in Gaza and Lebanon for what it truly is [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=451.22s)]
*  Because as one Lebanese political analyst put it this week Israel has now turned what was once the dahiya doctrine [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=456.82s)]
*  Into something even far worse [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=463.14s)]
*  Quote Israel's actions in Lebanon do not embody the dahiya doctrine [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=465.46s)]
*  But rather the Gaza doctrine the key distinction between the two doctrines lies in the Gaza doctrines [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=469.34s)]
*  Genocidal and ethnic cleansing aims which are now beginning to manifest in Lebanon [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=475.53999999999996s)]
*  Look whether in Gaza or Lebanon again and again Israeli political and military officials clearly state their aims their intention to wreck [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=481.14s)]
*  Destroy and wipe out entire towns cities and even countries [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=490.32s)]
*  While Western leaders and the Western media [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  shamefully look away [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlEPOkl1nV4&t=499.2s)]
