# “Most DESTRUCTIVE” Election in US History? Experts Weigh In on 2nd Trump Term
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E)
*  So, what does a Trump second term look like? It's no longer abstract hypothetical speculation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=0.0s)]
*  It's coming very soon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=6.48s)]
*  Joining me now to talk about the implications of this big Trump win, Norm Ornstein, veteran [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=7.8s)]
*  DC politics watcher, emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. I think it's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=12.16s)]
*  fair to say a long-standing Trump critic and former Trump administration official turned [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=16.46s)]
*  long-standing Trump critic Olivia Troy, who was also part of Republicans for Harris. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  Olivia, let me start with you. Before we get to Trump, what was the mood last night in [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  the Harris camp? What was it like when those results were coming in? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  You know, I think at first, obviously, it was hopeful. But I think as the night went [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=35.44s)]
*  on, it was grim. And I think for someone like me, it was just watching my worst fears being [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=40.72s)]
*  realized. And I just couldn't stop thinking about all the people that were going to be [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=49.28s)]
*  affected. It was awful. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=53.44s)]
*  Norm, you have watched a fair few elections in this town. A lot of people come and go [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=55.64s)]
*  into that building. Where does last night stand historically compared to previous presidential [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  elections in your view? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=65.0s)]
*  I think that this is the most significant and most destructive presidential election, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=66.28s)]
*  probably in our history, because while we have elected bad presidents before, we've [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=72.32s)]
*  elected incompetent presidents before, we have not elected a president who has made [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=78.36s)]
*  clear during the campaign that he will be a dictator on day one and will destroy or [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=84.8s)]
*  shred the Constitution to whatever degree he feels it is necessary. And even worse, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=90.96s)]
*  maybe is the enablers around him from the Supreme Court through the other institutions. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=97.47999999999999s)]
*  My fear is not just Donald Trump. It is that the guardrails we have built up over two and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=103.24s)]
*  a half centuries are not going to hold. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=108.2s)]
*  Olivia, there are people who have said to me consistently for a year, and I'm sure they [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=110.56s)]
*  said this to you, it can't be that bad. It won't be that bad. We already had him, Trump [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  won. He didn't do any of the stuff you're saying he's going to do in the first term. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=118.12s)]
*  And one of the answers I give is that there were some guardrails in the first term. There [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=121.56s)]
*  were some restraints, not many, but Mike Pence, your old boss, did stand up to him on January [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=125.44s)]
*  6, 2021. There were the John Kelly's and Jim Mattis's of this world. There were courts [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=130.0s)]
*  that blocked him in a way that the current Supreme Court has said he has criminal immunity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=135.44s)]
*  Talk to us about the lack of restraints in the current Trump team. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=139.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're going to have a circle of complete loyalists and enablers. And I [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=143.0s)]
*  think my Steve Bannon's out of prison back in the picture. I think when you look at this [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=147.2s)]
*  and you think about like the Mike Flynn's of the world, I mean, they're going to be [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=152.32s)]
*  advising. I don't know whether they'll be at the table or not, but they'll certainly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=155.92s)]
*  have a direct connection into the Oval Office. I think that's pretty frightening and appalling. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=158.88s)]
*  And look, I, as someone who worked during the entire Trump administration on everything [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=164.28s)]
*  that pretty much was issued when it came to Homeland Security and the national security [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  space, the reason the list on the travel ban wasn't larger was because of people like me [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=174.04000000000002s)]
*  who were in those meetings and other national security people who didn't bend to Stephen [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=179.58s)]
*  Miller's knee, who said, no, it's just not there. That is not how we work as a community. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=184.28s)]
*  And my fear is like I'm hearing from government employees right now this morning. They're [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=190.52s)]
*  contacting me. I'm getting messages from them saying we are, we're worried. I'm scared. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=194.76s)]
*  And what I saw towards the end of the Trump administration was people of integrity and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=200.24s)]
*  character that I had respected early on in it. I saw them start to change. And that I [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=206.0s)]
*  think is the concern is that he's the master of bringing out the worst of people. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=211.04s)]
*  Norm, a good friend of mine, businessman, Democratic Party donor, he said, come on, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  Trump can't be a dictator. The deep state in this country, the bureaucracy, the courts, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=222.04s)]
*  the civil servants, it's very hard for one man to turn that around. What do you say to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  that line of argument? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=231.0s)]
*  It's not going to be just one man. We already know, we have a Supreme Court that gave him [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=232.04s)]
*  immunity and has basically given him a green light. And even though they've tried to restrain [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=237.76s)]
*  the executive branch in theory, they will let him do whatever he wants. We know what [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=243.88000000000002s)]
*  the Senate is like. We know what other judges are like. There will be some with courage. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=250.08s)]
*  But what we also know is that he is going to have a Republican Senate that will confirm [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=255.44s)]
*  anybody he picks, and that will include people utterly unfit for prominent jobs from the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=261.90000000000003s)]
*  Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State through the head of intelligence. We [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=268.32s)]
*  know that he is putting in people who will destroy the bureaucracy and dismantle the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=273.16s)]
*  deep state because of Schedule F, which will enable them to fire people. And we know that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=278.88s)]
*  the House remains a little bit in the balance. But I just don't see the normal restraints [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=286.4s)]
*  that exist. You hate to bring up the German analogies. And after all, it was one of our [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=292.96s)]
*  prominent generals who first called him a fascist. But if you look at any of the history [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=298.68s)]
*  of Germany, it was businessmen like that who thought, you know, we'll get lower tax rates. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=303.52s)]
*  It's not going to be that bad. We can restrain him. They were the ones who got co-opted and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=309.54s)]
*  the worst happened. Maybe the worst won't happen, but it's going to be damn close, Medi. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=315.16s)]
*  No, what's interesting is a lot of our prominent business leaders right now are not acting [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=319.48s)]
*  like they can restrain him. They're acting like they're scared of him. Jeff Bezos, Mark [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=323.08s)]
*  Zuckerberg have come out very strongly with very sycophantic statements of praise today. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=326.4s)]
*  These are people who Trump has attacked personally, threatened with imprisonment, verbally abused. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=331.44s)]
*  They are some of the richest people on planet Earth. And if they're rolling over, what can [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  the rest of us do? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, what's going to happen is that the government agencies that have tried to put [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  restraints on business are going to be used as a personal weapon of Donald Trump. He will [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=347.15999999999997s)]
*  go after those who defy him and then everybody will fall into line. That's a history we've [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=352.64s)]
*  seen before as well. And we know with the bureaucracy, if they get rid of 50,000 out [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=361.2s)]
*  of 2.7 or 2.8 million, all the rest of them are going to know that they're next in line [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=366.0s)]
*  and they'll do whatever they say. That's what dictators do and he has the playbook. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  Olivia, talk to us about, you mentioned briefly earlier about Stephen Miller and the travel [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  ban. All of that stuff is going to come back with steroids, right? And this time, as Norm [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=379.8s)]
*  says, they have the Senate. They don't have to worry about can Michael Flynn get confirmed [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=384.16s)]
*  because Republican senators will fall in line. Judges, they confirmed some pretty bad ones [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  last time around. There'll be even more ABA unqualified judges. What's the mood going [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=391.70000000000005s)]
*  to be like? You've been in that camp. What's the mood going to be like with the Bannons [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=397.88000000000005s)]
*  and the Millers? And now Elon Musk in that inner circle, do you think, right now? Today, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=402.40000000000003s)]
*  for example, as we speak? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=406.92s)]
*  Oh, I mean, they're excited. I've got to tell you, I mean, they're, these are not people [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=408.12s)]
*  that aren't vindictive. And I think that they have had a plan that they've been working [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  on for years now. And look, Trump's press secretary today confirmed the mass deportations. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=417.64000000000004s)]
*  There were people that said that I was like hyperbolizing the fact that this was going [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=422.76s)]
*  to happen. People thought that, no, I mean, that won't be carried out that way. I have [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=426.16s)]
*  no idea what the day after inauguration looks like, but I remember living at Versailles [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=430.16s)]
*  and right out of the gate was a travel ban. And then one executive order after another. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=435.24s)]
*  And it was chaos at the airports. I expect there to be chaos on the streets. I have no [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=439.47999999999996s)]
*  idea what they plan to do. But this time, this time National Guard, he's talked about [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=443.52s)]
*  Insurrection Act. Do you, Indira, ask this? Do you feel personally insecure right now, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=447.12s)]
*  given we know Trump likes vengeance? Absolutely. Yeah, I'm concerned for myself. I'm concerned [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=453.15999999999997s)]
*  for people in the media. I'm concerned for people like you, Norm. This is very real. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  These people, you know, they don't forget. No. Norm, Democrats, if you're the Democrats, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=466.32s)]
*  what are you doing today? One, you're praying that these seats in the house that are still [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=473.32s)]
*  up for grabs turn enough in your direction that you can have a majority. It would be [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=478.35999999999996s)]
*  a limited check, but it would be a very important one. Second, I think they are gobsmacked. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=483.64s)]
*  They don't know what to think. You can't blame Harris and the Harris campaign, which didn't [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=492.2s)]
*  make huge mistakes. You can't say, no, I don't think so. I think this is something... [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=497.47999999999996s)]
*  She didn't break with Biden? If she had broken with Biden, I don't think it would have made [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=502.76s)]
*  a wit of difference. Look at the breadth and depth of this. This is a wide swath of people, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=507.72s)]
*  every category, practically speaking, that moved in a Republican direction. They were [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  upset with not just Joe Biden and the Biden policies. It was a much broader rejection [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=519.78s)]
*  of the ruling class and a belief that we can just blow things up and whatever emerges will [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=526.08s)]
*  be better. I don't think a different nominee would have ended up faring any better. We [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=531.96s)]
*  missed this stuff. There's one other thing we have to say here, which is we've mentioned [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aWc43M6q8E&t=536.8s)]
