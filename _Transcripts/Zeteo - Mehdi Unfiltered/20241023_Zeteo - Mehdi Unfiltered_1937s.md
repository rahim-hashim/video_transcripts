Video Description: “They made him into a messiah… He's become like the Pakistani Mandela in a way… I don't think they [the military] have the answer to how to suppress his popularity. And one of the ways to do that is, unfortunately, you know, an assassination, another assassination attempt.”

Zulfi Bukhari, who served as a cabinet member under former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan — and is currently his adviser on international affairs and media — spoke to Mehdi Hasan and Zeteo subscribers in a Town Hall Q&A about Khan’s imprisonment. Khan’s situation has become dire, according to both his ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith and senior members of his party, the PTI. Bukhari discusses heightened concerns about Khan’s safety, the Pakistani military, and more in this Town Hall. He and Mehdi also answer questions from paid Zeteo subscribers.

# Another Assassination Attempt? Imran Khan’s Adviser Talks to Mehdi Hasan
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E)
*  Thank you for joining us on this Zateo live town hall on Pakistan and the fate of Imran Khan. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=0.0s)]
*  Many of you remember that I interviewed Imran Khan back in May via written questions while he was in prison. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=5.2s)]
*  Last week his ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith for the first time came out publicly saying she's worried about his safety, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=11.52s)]
*  that their sons are no longer able to speak to him on their weekly calls, that he's been deprived of electricity, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=16.72s)]
*  that he's in solitary confinement and that his lawyers are worried about him. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=22.0s)]
*  So my question is, is the Pakistani government, is the Pakistani military about to do something shocking to Imran Khan, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=25.2s)]
*  the leader of the PTI, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=31.04s)]
*  Joining me to discuss this today on this special Zateo town hall is Zulfi Bukhari, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=34.24s)]
*  who served as special assistant to Prime Minister Khan when he was in government. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=38.56s)]
*  He was a member of his cabinet and he's currently an advisor to Imran Khan on international affairs and the media. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=41.84s)]
*  Zulfi, thank you for joining us on this Zateo town hall. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you Mehdi, thank you for having me. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=50.96s)]
*  So I'm going to throw some questions at you, but everyone in the chat, you're on a Zoom town hall, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=52.72s)]
*  I see there are hundreds of you now joining. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=57.04s)]
*  Please do stick your questions in the chat and I will read as many as we can get through over the next half an hour with our special guest. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=59.12s)]
*  But Zulfi, let me kick it off. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=65.84s)]
*  What are you hearing about Imran Khan's conditions currently in prison in Adiyala in Pakistan? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=67.28s)]
*  Well, we got it from the horse's mouth himself. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=74.16s)]
*  Five members of our party were allowed to meet Imran a couple of days back [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=76.64s)]
*  and in that, you know, Imran Khan had categorically said that his conditions had worsened massively, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=82.48s)]
*  but his spirits were high. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=88.88s)]
*  He had no electricity, there was no hot water, there was inadequate food. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=90.56s)]
*  He was in 24-hour lockdown, whereas usually he would get an hour of exercise. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=95.28s)]
*  So, you know, he was obviously now started the severity of it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=101.2s)]
*  And the same thing probably is happening with his wife, by the way, who he hasn't been allowed to meet now for 10, 12 days. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=105.84s)]
*  No one's heard of her, no one's visited her, no one's allowed to visit her, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=112.08s)]
*  and, you know, nor family, nor spokespersons, nor his legal team. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=116.16s)]
*  And I'll just let you know that when Imran Khan got put into this even further solitary confinement, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=121.68s)]
*  it was while these amendments were, you know, now shaping up as they did last night. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=128.56s)]
*  And, you know, the only person who he had given the last instructions to was one of his legal team, Intazar Panjota, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=133.68s)]
*  who was his lawyer in many cases and his spokesperson to give his message from prison all the time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=140.24s)]
*  And he's been picked up for the last 15-odd days as well, and we don't know where he is, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  we haven't heard from him, and he's abducted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  Wow. His lawyer? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  His lawyer, yes, one of his lawyers in many cases, and his official spokesperson from prison. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=154.56s)]
*  He's the same person, and he's been abducted. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=159.52s)]
*  Were you surprised by Jemima Goldsmith's intervention, his ex-wife in London last week, on Twitter? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=162.56s)]
*  She has been relatively quiet for the past year or so on the grounds, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=167.84s)]
*  as she rightly argues that anything she says will be interpreted as foreign intervention, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=172.16s)]
*  quote unquote Jewish intervention. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=176.08s)]
*  She gets a lot of anti-Semitic hate, but she felt it's so extreme, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  the situation right now, that she had to speak out, especially on behalf of her sons. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=181.2s)]
*  Well, look, we're glad that she did. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=185.28s)]
*  Her voice carries a lot of weight, especially in the UK society and internationally. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=186.96s)]
*  I'm in touch with his sons, and, you know, they're extremely worried, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=191.68s)]
*  and I'm glad that they convinced their mother to do so. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=195.2s)]
*  Obviously, before they had contact, Imran Khan had contact with his sons, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  so I guess, you know, apart from being in prison, it wasn't as life-threatening worrying, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  and this has obviously shaken up everyone, especially his family. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=209.44s)]
*  So just to remind people joining this Zoom town hall, which we at Zateo are hosting, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=214.88s)]
*  with Zulfi Bukhari from former Prime Minister Khan's party, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=220.16s)]
*  there are hundreds of you now joining the chat. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=223.2s)]
*  Please do stick questions in the chat, and I will try and ask them as soon as I can see them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=225.11999999999998s)]
*  There's a few coming in before I… [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  There's a Q&A, so you can put them in the Q&A, so I'm just looking at some of the questions now. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  While I look at a question, let me just put this to you, Zulfi. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=237.76s)]
*  The Adiyala jail authorities said last week in response to Jemima's claims that, quote, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=240.56s)]
*  Imran Khan has been given all facilities, including uninterrupted electricity, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  proper meals, and the opportunity to exercise regularly. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  They said that a professional cook prepares his meals. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=252.16s)]
*  They even released a detailed menu of apparently what he served every day. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=254.48s)]
*  Khan's breakfast consists of coffee, chia seeds, beetroot juice, yogurt, chapati, biscuits. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=258.8s)]
*  For lunch, he served local chicken. Dinner includes porridge. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=263.44s)]
*  What is your response to the jail authorities saying, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=266.4s)]
*  no, he's totally fine, this is all lies and conspiracies from his supporters? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=268.64s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, before he did have time to exercise, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=273.68s)]
*  he was given normal prison food. I mean, they're just being… they're just adding on and lying in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=279.44s)]
*  many ways. But off late, especially the last two weeks, hence Jemima's tweet and everyone else's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  concern, all these things have been shut down, including electricity. And he's totally confined [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=291.76s)]
*  24 hours. So, you know, it's an absolute lie. And reality is that why are we not allowed to see him? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=299.36s)]
*  The question that should be being asked is that what randomly 12 days ago would you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=307.91999999999996s)]
*  issue a direct order from the Interior Ministry that no one's allowed to see him around Khan [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=312.23999999999995s)]
*  all of a sudden for 12 days? Did he beat someone up? Did he do something in prison? Like, what are [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=318.4s)]
*  we talking about? How does that just all of a sudden take place? No one wants to question that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=322.24s)]
*  We're worrying about if he has chia seeds or not. But we're not worrying about why a prisoner all [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=327.2s)]
*  of a sudden got taken into 24-hour custody and is not allowed to see his legal team, family, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=331.6s)]
*  or anyone from his party all of a sudden. And in the middle of the night, you pass these [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=338.32000000000005s)]
*  constitutional amendments. So we'll come to the constitutional amendments. We've got some questions [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=342.16s)]
*  about it too. Just Nader Barakat in the Q&A asks, can you please remind those of us who are not [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  familiar in this case, why is he imprisoned? Because a bunch of charges went away, right, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  Zulfi? But there's a bunch of new ones that have come in. Yeah, look, that's an excellent question [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=356.24s)]
*  because no one really has the answer. Imran Khan had, when we came out of power and we were [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=361.28s)]
*  overthrown, he had about 200 cases on him, including murder, terrorism, all sorts of things. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=367.76s)]
*  By the grace of God, most of his cases went away because they were ridiculous. You know, charges, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=375.28s)]
*  him sitting in one city, there was murder charges placed in another city, which he hadn't visited [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=380.96s)]
*  probably for two years. And then there was also the Cypher case along with others. And he was [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=384.56s)]
*  acquitted any case that came out of the lower courts and went into a high court, he got acquitted [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=391.36s)]
*  of. The only case that he's got a conviction of is the Kangaroo Court that was set up in a Diyala [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=396.72s)]
*  prison itself. And he was not allowed to give a defense. His lawyers weren't allowed to speak. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=402.8s)]
*  And around three and a half minutes, they gave a judgment that he's convicted with no defense. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=408.72s)]
*  Convicted of what? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=412.88s)]
*  Convicted of was the Toshihana case of him selling treasury watches illegally, right? Something as [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=413.92s)]
*  ridiculous as that. And we weren't allowed to give a defense. And on that same case, Mehdi, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=421.36s)]
*  you have a UN arbitrary detention working group, 27 page odd decision saying it's absolutely [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=426.96s)]
*  ridiculous. Not only is it ridiculous, he should be released. Not only should he be released, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=433.68s)]
*  he should be given compensation. The people who have placed him in prison and are a part of this [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  should be put under inquiry. And this was and also the UN said that this was only done so he [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=442.8s)]
*  couldn't participate in the February 2024 elections. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=448.08s)]
*  Isn't there also a new case thrown against him? I saw accusing him of incitement to murder [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=451.36s)]
*  because of a police officer who died in some PDI protests. Is that correct? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=456.16s)]
*  I mean, that's just a new one on it, but again, not convicted. So his conviction [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=460.0s)]
*  is only on this. And just for the gentleman who asked the question, by the way, his sentence also, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=464.24s)]
*  because this case was so ridiculous, the sentence is suspended. So it's as bizarre as you get. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=471.12s)]
*  He's convicted, but bail has been granted and conviction has been suspended. Bail has been [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=476.08s)]
*  granted for him and his wife, but he's not allowed to leave prison. So it's he's basically in prison [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=481.6s)]
*  on a remand like we need a seven day remand more, five day remand more and a whole year, a year plus [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=487.44s)]
*  has gone by. So he's in prison for no reason whatsoever. Isn't there also some ludicrous case [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=492.72s)]
*  about him and his wife being illegally married? Yeah, and then he ended up winning that. One of [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=497.68s)]
*  them was that apparently him and his wife didn't marry the halal way. And then all judges, all [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=501.6s)]
*  clerics from all sects of Islam deemed that he was, the court deemed that he was in that case [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=509.12s)]
*  came out as well. And Amnesty International, Mehdi, just I think a week or two ago also just released [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=515.04s)]
*  a whole document and statement saying that he's illegally in prison and he should be released [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=520.72s)]
*  immediately also. So on that note, Shehzad Taker in our in the Q&A asks, what if any next steps are [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=526.8s)]
*  there for Imran Khan in terms of his legal battles? Well, his legal battles obviously yesterday was a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=533.04s)]
*  big blow because, you know, the independence of judiciary was basically clipped and taken away [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  yesterday. However, you know, we want we in a way we actually want the conviction so that we can [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=545.04s)]
*  appeal in the higher courts. We you know, if everything remained sane within the judiciary, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=552.56s)]
*  we know he would get relief and acquitted in all his cases as soon as they go to the high and then [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=557.5999999999999s)]
*  the Supreme Court. So we actually want the cases to be heard. But the only case that he's convicted [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=562.64s)]
*  in is not being heard. Our appeal is not being heard. It's just thrown away. Whereas cases that [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  they want to go against him are being heard daily on fast track. So you mentioned the amendment, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=571.92s)]
*  a lot of questions, a lot of people are asking about is the judiciary free and fair? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=580.56s)]
*  So let's take a question from ones here. I just saw it. Usman Sethi says, what does the future [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=587.36s)]
*  of Pakistan look like with the current 26th Amendment being put in place? Can you break [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=593.36s)]
*  down what's going on with the judiciary in these constitutional amendments for our viewers? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  Yes, I was basically the establishment and the government, primarily the establishment [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=601.28s)]
*  using the government, wanted to pass this constitutional amendment, which the first one [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=607.76s)]
*  was very draconian and it had things like military court in it. It had the chief of army staff's [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=613.28s)]
*  unquestionable extensions in it. It had, you know, basically it was done to basically rip [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=619.6s)]
*  apart or dismantle PTI further. And then, you know, we rallied against it. We got a few allies with [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=624.88s)]
*  us and we, and now they passed a softer version. Eventually last night at 4 a.m., the Senate and the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=630.88s)]
*  assembly was miraculously open at 4 or 5 a.m. in the morning, started around 1130 at night. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=637.92s)]
*  But what is done is that basically it's ripped apart the independence of the judiciary because [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=642.96s)]
*  now they've made a 12 member committee, which consists of eight MNAs, member of national [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=648.72s)]
*  assembly and four senators, which will be two-thirds government, you know, people, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=655.68s)]
*  and they will then select the chief justice. They will then help create the bench. So what that does [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  is that effectively your judiciary is subsideant to the executive because whatever the prime minister [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=671.92s)]
*  and his government now wants, that committee will get the judge to do. It will no longer have the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=678.64s)]
*  vigor or the resistance to stand up against it. Otherwise they won't be part of this prestigious [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=684.08s)]
*  bench and they'll never be chief justice. So now whatever law they want passed, whatever case they [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=689.5200000000001s)]
*  want going their way, if I put a case up against the government, I expect my judiciary to hear [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=694.88s)]
*  independently. But now the government's ministers, the law minister and everyone are picking the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=701.5200000000001s)]
*  judges who are going to be hearing the case that I'm putting against the government. So they'll [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  never go anything anti-government anymore. So it's basically clipped, you know, the judiciary [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=709.92s)]
*  altogether. It sounds very much like the US system currently where you can pick your own judges if [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=716.56s)]
*  you're a former president on trial. Uzma Danish asks, why is the PTI not going to the International [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=720.7199999999999s)]
*  Court of Justice, taking international routes given this 26th Amendment, given Pakistani courts [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=727.1999999999999s)]
*  are heavily compromised? Can this be done ASAP? Look, we have gone to the UN when it came towards [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=731.92s)]
*  detention. Recently we went to the special repertoire in the UN as well due to torture [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=738.24s)]
*  because don't forget what they're doing to Imran Khan comes under the laws of torture basically of [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=744.88s)]
*  how they're treating him in prison. It's not necessarily physical, but the fact that you're [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=749.28s)]
*  going against prison laws, it ends up becoming torture according to international law. So we are [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=753.2s)]
*  going to the International Court of Justice. I mean, the lawyers are looking into it, but usually [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=759.6s)]
*  like you saw in the case of Palestine, you know, South Africa, when you have to have a country, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=763.84s)]
*  can only go to the ICJ, independent can't, a party can't. So, you know, we have to, we're looking at [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  other options on how to go about this. And by the way, the UN also has passed many statements about [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=776.5600000000001s)]
*  this new amendment saying that it's completely against international law. There's a few people [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=782.88s)]
*  in the chat asking what is PTI up to your party? Some people seem dissatisfied. Asher Sayed says, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=789.44s)]
*  why is the PTI not protesting outside the Adiyala jail? It seems like the PTI leadership hasn't made [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  serious efforts to get Imran Khan out. What's your response to that? Well, their frustration is [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  absolutely justifiable. If I say so myself, you know, we must understand that the brutality that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=808.08s)]
*  happened in Punjab, not so much in KP, was a complete different level that the country has [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=816.32s)]
*  never seen. We had 13,000 people thrown into prison. We have Imran Khan, our top tier leadership, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  former two, three time former foreign minister, Shamimud Qureshi, workers, his wife, his sisters [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=828.32s)]
*  are in prison. So Imran, his wife, his sisters, all are in prison. And at one time we had 13,000 [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=835.12s)]
*  other people in prison. The brutality that the Punjab police deals with protesters is completely [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=840.1600000000001s)]
*  different from the rest of the country. And every time we've come out in protest, we've been [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=845.12s)]
*  tear gassed, shot with rubber bullets, beaten hundreds of arrests. So, you know, at the end of [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=849.84s)]
*  the day, we keep doing these protests and we keep getting hundreds of people arrested. Then for six [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=856.8s)]
*  months we're in courts trying to get them released. Their families are suffering, their bread earners. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=861.12s)]
*  So we have to be very careful in how we go about these protests. Plus, we're worried that like May [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=865.6s)]
*  9th, you know, they'll try to do a sort of false flag operation and blame more cases on Imran Khan [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=872.32s)]
*  that he's inciting violence from sitting inside. But now after these amendments, I agree with the [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=877.6800000000001s)]
*  with the gentleman who asked the question, there's nothing else left for us to do apart from come out [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=883.12s)]
*  in large scale and do a peaceful nationwide protest consistently until we at least reverse [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=888.4000000000001s)]
*  these amendments. And a bunch of people are asking, like multiple people, let me check if I can grab [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=895.7600000000001s)]
*  one name, but many are asking what can, so Sadaqat Khan, for example, a bunch of people in our [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=901.76s)]
*  commenters are all asking, what can we do living in the West, living in the UK, Canada, America? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=907.6s)]
*  Sayed Ali Al-Satt says, what can we do as overseas Pakistanis to help Imran Khan is what the question [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=913.76s)]
*  a lot of people ask. Look, overseas Pakistanis, you know, recognized Imran Khan as their prime [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=919.36s)]
*  minister 27 years ago. They were the first to support him in politics when people in Pakistan [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=925.12s)]
*  ridiculed him and laughed in his face that he will never get anywhere in politics. So they have been [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=930.8s)]
*  the strongest backbone of Imran Khan all through the decades. At the moment, what the most important [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  thing is, is awareness. It's about which country you're in, where can you lobby your local MPs, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=943.68s)]
*  senators, congressmen, you know, NGOs, human rights organizations. This is the most important thing [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=949.52s)]
*  that could happen right now. Obviously, the party, you know, the accounts have been frozen. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=958.24s)]
*  There's another case of international money being used, foreign money funding into the party. That's [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=964.64s)]
*  also an issue for us paying lawyers, multiple lawyers, you know, hundreds across the country [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=970.72s)]
*  fighting these cases. So funding is a big issue as well. But, you know, apart from that, I would say [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=976.32s)]
*  to lobbying, raising your voice in the right places to, you know, give awareness of what's [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=982.32s)]
*  happening to Imran Khan and his political party. Sayed Ali Akbar asks, Mr. Bakhari, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=987.76s)]
*  you're in the UK. What are you doing in the UK for Imran Khan? Have you raised this issue in [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=993.92s)]
*  front of the British authorities? Multiple times I've had many. What do they say? Well, you know, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=997.92s)]
*  quote unquote, as long as there's a veneer and a very high, well, as far as you go internationally, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1005.2s)]
*  for foreign relations, you know, as long as there's a veneer of democracy, you know, it works for, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1012.64s)]
*  unfortunately, for the West. And that's what the sad bit is, is that countries like UK and the US who [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1017.76s)]
*  champion democracy talk about it all the time, you know, just to have no regard for it. I mean, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1023.04s)]
*  that the 2024 February election was an open shut case, all independent, you know, elections, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1028.8799999999999s)]
*  election surveyors have all said that it's an illegal election. I had a, I raised the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1036.3200000000002s)]
*  voice in the House of Lords as well. We had a session over there with Lord Dan Hannan and [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1042.0s)]
*  MP Nas Shah and many others hosted and them two hosted it. Lots of MPs and lordships showed up [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1047.6000000000001s)]
*  and we raised it and we told them everything. A lot of them, a lot of them were shocked at what's [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1053.8400000000001s)]
*  happening. But the point is that what are we going to do about it? No one wants to do anything about [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1057.52s)]
*  it. They want to say, oh, that's really sad. That's really, we feel really bad for Imran, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  but no one wants to go further than that. A few people have mentioned the Oxford Chancellor race. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  What's the latest on that? We published a piece from Lord Hannan, the conservative [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1072.96s)]
*  PM making the case that Imran Khan should not just be considered eligible to run for [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1076.96s)]
*  Chancellor of Oxford University, where he famously studied and played cricket, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1082.72s)]
*  but would make a good Chancellor. What is the latest on that? Can he run from prison? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1085.84s)]
*  Well, they've refused for him to run. It's quite a juicy story actually and I think [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1089.92s)]
*  it will probably be coming out very soon. They refused for him to run without giving [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1097.52s)]
*  an adequate reason. There's four conditions in which you're not allowed to run as Chancellor. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1103.1200000000001s)]
*  And apart from fit and able is one of them, I think the fourth one. And we have a matrix [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1109.68s)]
*  chambers, which is the top chambers in UK. We've got a Casey, Helen, who's given an opinion that [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1119.6000000000001s)]
*  Oxford University has totally misread this and there is no way that Imran Khan is not eligible [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1124.32s)]
*  to run for this chancellorship. And there's a twist in the story that what opinion did they go on? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1130.88s)]
*  They haven't given us a reasonable justification yet. They haven't given us actually a justification. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1138.4s)]
*  So our lawyers have written to them today morning again and we've said we want the exact reason or [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1142.64s)]
*  if you've taken a barrister's opinion, we want to know what the barrister's opinion is. The funny [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1148.48s)]
*  thing is that there's someone from the media sent me a screenshot from a barrister's opinion that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1153.2s)]
*  they had taken and it was from the same chamber. And it said that Imran Khan due to his conviction [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1157.92s)]
*  in Pakistan may not be eligible to, is unlikely to be eligible to run for the Chancellor. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1165.6799999999998s)]
*  Now the question is, is that who paid for that opinion? Because the company that's coming up [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1170.48s)]
*  for that payment is a company that was formed just in September and no one knows what it is. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1175.6799999999998s)]
*  It's got no directors on company house. It's an anonymous company. So I went to the same chamber [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1180.8799999999999s)]
*  and got a Casey from that chamber to give me a full-fledged opinion. And even the barrister [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1186.56s)]
*  that wrote that opinion said that nothing was presented to me apart from the judgment that he [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1192.4s)]
*  had in Pakistan. Not the UN report, not the Amnesty International report, not that his defense wasn't [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1196.88s)]
*  allowed to be filed, nothing of the sort. So it's a very shabby job. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1202.48s)]
*  Someone out there is spooked at the prospect of Imran Khan becoming Chancellor of Oxford. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1208.5600000000002s)]
*  It was a very shabby job by Oxford. It was very disappointing. And you know, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1212.5600000000002s)]
*  my alma mater sadly. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1217.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to release the opinion very soon, probably tomorrow morning of the case of the Casey. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1218.8s)]
*  I don't think I've ever voted in a Chancellor's election. Let's see if I will going forward. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1225.04s)]
*  All right. A lot of questions. I'm in the US, you're in the UK. A lot of questions in the chat [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1230.32s)]
*  about America's role in all this. Negat Khan asks, is it true the United States is behind [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1234.48s)]
*  Imran Khan's fall from power question that gets asked a lot, especially in relation to the cipher [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1239.6000000000001s)]
*  and the intercept reporting? And in addition, I want to throw a subsidiary question, which was [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1244.48s)]
*  from, if I can find it, Kora Mirza says, what about the US involvement in all of this? The [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1249.2s)]
*  State Department has mentioned they were monitoring and concerned about the election results. Is [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1253.84s)]
*  democracy being followed in the US's eyes? Well, I don't know in which in which lens they [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1258.08s)]
*  can even say that democracy has been followed in Pakistan. You know, they keep talking about it, but [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1264.88s)]
*  and the spokesperson of the White House keeps in the State Department says, we know we want to [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1270.64s)]
*  ensure democracy. What democracy are we talking about? You know, this election, two thirds of it [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1275.1200000000001s)]
*  in round one, hands down, we had our symbol ripped away from us, our election symbol ripped away from [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1279.68s)]
*  us. We contested as independents. And yet we are the largest majority in as a party in the National [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1285.2s)]
*  Assembly at the moment as well. As far as for the US's role in it, you know, it's the cipher was [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1292.24s)]
*  very clear, right? It was the diplomatic cable. Correct. Now the diplomatic cable from, you know, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1299.2s)]
*  Mr. Donald Lou was very straightforward to our ambassador, that if Iran does not, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1305.6000000000001s)]
*  quote unquote, behave, you know, we will be very unhappy with him and we will not, and we will not [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1312.0s)]
*  support, you know, him any further. And we will support the vote of no confidence in a way. So [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1318.16s)]
*  there's nothing more to it. The language he used, the behavior that he, you know, expressed in [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1324.96s)]
*  front of our ambassador was very demeaning, to say the least. And it was very undiplomatic like. So [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1330.72s)]
*  that's something which is fact. Now, how much did America get involved or not get involved is a [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1337.52s)]
*  different story. But them not getting involved and ensuring democracy is often good enough for the [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1344.08s)]
*  establishment to continue on doing what they want to do. So there's no doubt, like Imran Khan said, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1350.64s)]
*  that forget if America was involved or not, America would take intelligence from us, right? Now, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1356.4s)]
*  where would that intelligence come from? They will get their intelligence guys to reach out to [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1361.3600000000001s)]
*  probably our army chief at the time. And him and Imran weren't getting along. And he probably said, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1364.96s)]
*  you know, President Biden, you know, Imran Khan's really anti-West and he's a beardless Taliban and [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1368.96s)]
*  he's this and he's that. We need to get rid of him. Okay, fine. Do what you have to do. And, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1375.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, we're turning a blind eye to it. Perhaps that's the story. But it 100 percent came from our [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1378.72s)]
*  army chief. And there was 100 percent no involvement to stop or ensure democracy in any way by the U.S. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1383.28s)]
*  That's obvious by Donald Lou's cable. We'll come back to the army chief in a moment. Yasir Navidas. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1391.2s)]
*  And a lot of Pakistani Americans I'm hearing are saying, well, we want to support Donald Trump [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1397.04s)]
*  because we think he'll be better on Imran Khan than Joe Biden, who they blame for being involved in a [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1400.64s)]
*  coup. Yasir Navidas, if Trump gets re-elected, does he see Khan, do you, Zulfi, see Khan coming [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1405.12s)]
*  out of prison under a Trump presidency? Well, look, I think President Trump has a soft corner [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1410.4799999999998s)]
*  for Imran Khan for sure. And, you know, the two, three meetings they had, our relationship with the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1419.1999999999998s)]
*  U.S. was exceptionally good while Donald Trump was the president. It wasn't good when the Democrats [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1426.4799999999998s)]
*  came in and for what reason? India pressure, something else, you know, Afghan, maybe. But, [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1434.96s)]
*  you know, so I think Donald Trump in that sense, you know, wouldn't be worse for PTI and Imran Khan, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1441.76s)]
*  I think certainly would be better. Wouldn't be worse. When it comes to that particular issue. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1449.44s)]
*  I should point out to our viewers that Sajid Tarrar, who's a very famous, not famous, but he's [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1454.8s)]
*  known in circles as one of the few Muslims close to Trump who's a Pakistani American, has said he [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1460.0s)]
*  hasn't heard anything from Trump saying or the Trump camp that they have any interest in the [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1464.72s)]
*  Imran case. Let's see what happens if he even wins. Let's talk about the military. You mentioned [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1468.88s)]
*  the chief of staff, who was Bajwa at the time. Currently it's Aasim Munir. Imran Khan, in his [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  interview with me earlier this year, said he places all of the blame on Omar Bajwa and the then chief [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1480.08s)]
*  of staff for his predicament. He has since, in other interviews, talked about Aasim Munir, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1484.96s)]
*  the current army chief of staff, targeting him. He worries that he might try and kill him. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1490.08s)]
*  Before we get to that and the fate of Imran Khan, I just got to ask you one obvious question, which [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1496.32s)]
*  is Imran Khan came to power, PTI rose, because he was seen as being close to the military. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1500.8799999999999s)]
*  Right? That was a universal view, both inside and out of Pakistan. Do you, does the PTI, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1507.04s)]
*  do Imran Khan, do you have regrets getting close to a military that eventually screwed you over? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1512.08s)]
*  No, I don't think it's about having regrets to be close to the military. Look, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1516.16s)]
*  let me explain to this. The military, and I'm not just saying this as a biased thing. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1523.44s)]
*  Anyone can challenge me on opening up any constituency in Pakistan in this 2024 elections, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1529.1200000000001s)]
*  and you would see the results of it. The military has always, what they've always done is that, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1534.5600000000002s)]
*  let it be before Imran Khan was even a top runner for the premiership, if it was Noah [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1539.68s)]
*  Sharif and Benazir Bhutto at the time, they would always know who's coming in next because [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1544.88s)]
*  the public had already decided. So you knew which way this election was always going. It was never [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1549.8400000000001s)]
*  a close shout between Noah Sharif and Benazir. So when they knew that an election is happening [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1555.2s)]
*  and Benazir is going to be winning, they would cozy up next to Benazir Bhutto saying, okay, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1559.7600000000002s)]
*  you're going to become the next prime minister. All they will do then is support the wave that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1564.24s)]
*  the public have already decided. Same with Noah Sharif. And so then they would help them because [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  they know that they're the prime minister in waiting. And that's as far as it would go. And [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1574.72s)]
*  then they would have a fallout like they did with us. The same thing happened with Imran Khan. He [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1579.84s)]
*  had a great relationship with the army, and so we should. It's not India's army, it's our army. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1584.16s)]
*  And it's great to be on the same page. The problem is that when we just try to hijack or overstem [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1589.44s)]
*  ourselves in different spaces, that's where the differences become. Either you roll over [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1596.64s)]
*  and you say, sure, run my prime minister office for me, or you take a stand. The minute you take [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1604.72s)]
*  a stance, you're in conflict with each other. And that's really what happened with Imran. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1609.04s)]
*  The military has never rigged an election the way that they have this time. Even until five in the [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1615.04s)]
*  morning, PTI was winning and the army chief was in disarray. He didn't know how to do it. And then [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1620.56s)]
*  the DGISI at the time just had to clamp down, shut election results. Some results came three days [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1626.56s)]
*  later. I mean, it was as ridiculous as that. So this time it's just been smashing up people, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1632.48s)]
*  beating them up, throwing them in jail, imprisoning them. But to answer my question, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1638.08s)]
*  no regrets about your relationship with the military when it was good? Look, the demographic [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1642.88s)]
*  where Pakistan is, you cannot have a successful running government without having good ties with [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1647.92s)]
*  the military. Good ties doesn't mean that you let them run your ship. Good ties means that you have [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1654.64s)]
*  to work together because of the neighbourhood and the way that Pakistani military is entrenched [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1660.4s)]
*  in all of our walks of life. It's like 40% of the private sector, let alone your borders around Iran, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1665.52s)]
*  India, China, Afghanistan. It's also the biggest thing in the private market. I guess some might [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1672.64s)]
*  say, how does that change unless you have a civilian prime minister who's willing to stand [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1678.3200000000002s)]
*  up to the military? Quick question, Nadia Parach asks, has the US ambassador in Pakistan met Imran [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1681.0400000000002s)]
*  Khan in jail? No, he hasn't. Although there's been congressional hearings of congressmen requesting [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1686.64s)]
*  him to, and he should, you know, well, if he should or shouldn't, I don't know, that's his choice. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1695.6000000000001s)]
*  But he hasn't. How about foreign leaders? Do they allow foreign leaders like your Anwar Ibrahim [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1701.0400000000002s)]
*  types to visit Imran in prison? Well, Anwar Ibrahim requested to meet Imran Khan, and, you know, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1705.3600000000001s)]
*  he was refused or, you know, just delayed. And then it was then we arranged for him to see [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1713.44s)]
*  us as in PTI top tier leadership. The ambassador reached out to our parliamentary leader, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1720.4s)]
*  Omar Ryub, who was also the secretary general, while I was at the time, and a meeting was scheduled, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1727.6000000000001s)]
*  all happy, okay, fine, we get to meet the PM. And the meeting didn't take place and, you know, lost [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1733.8400000000001s)]
*  in sort of somehow organizational logistics, but ended up not meeting him. But Anwar Ibrahim, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1739.04s)]
*  Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, did request to meet Imran Khan in prison, and he wanted to meet our [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1746.3999999999999s)]
*  party, but unfortunately they blocked it. Okay, we're almost out of time. Last question, perhaps [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1750.8s)]
*  the most important question of all from Harris Mahmood, and I'm going to add a writer to it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1756.32s)]
*  Harris asks, what is the ultimate risk, in your view, of Imran Khan being tried in a military [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1760.72s)]
*  court? And I'm going to add the question to that is, and what is the risk, therefore, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1765.68s)]
*  of the military executing him? I think now with these amendments, I think this is just the [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1770.3200000000002s)]
*  beginning. I think because these were the hardest amendments to pass, it took a while. And yes, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1777.3600000000001s)]
*  it's a much more watered down amendment, but it's still very dangerous. And I will say on your show, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1782.96s)]
*  and so that it's on record, that now you'll see the 27th amendment coming soon, 28th amendment [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1788.72s)]
*  coming soon. And I know that somewhere along the line will be military courts, and that's a real [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1794.16s)]
*  fear for us. And do you believe the military ultimately wants to kill him, as Zulfiq Ali [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1800.96s)]
*  Bhutto was executed in the late 70s? They want to execute this former Prime Minister. Well, he was [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1808.24s)]
*  shot three times in the leg, you know, God saved him. It wasn't just a brush anywhere, it was [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1812.8000000000002s)]
*  four shots, three shots in the leg. And he miraculously survived that. I think the military [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1817.9199999999998s)]
*  didn't want, or the establishment, the top three, when we say military, I don't mean the whole [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  military, just the top two, three people. I think if they want him dead, it's only because they [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1830.48s)]
*  can't suppress him. They miscalculated badly thinking, we'll throw him in prison, throw away [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRtAv_UNr5E&t=1837.1999999999998s)]
