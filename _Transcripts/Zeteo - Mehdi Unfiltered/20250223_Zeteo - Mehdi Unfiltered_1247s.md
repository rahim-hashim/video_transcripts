Video Description: Award-winning director Asif Kapadia talks to Mehdi Hasan about the rising threats of climate change, authoritarianism, and the broligarchy – and how everyday people can begin to fight back.

Asif Kapadia – best known for his films ‘Diego Maradona’, ‘Amy’ and ‘Senna’ – discusses his new film, ‘2073,’ where he gives us a look at just one of the possibilities if the world continues to devolve at its current pace.

In his film, Kapadia examines the biggest threats facing society. “I don't even know if we can stop it, but it's the takeover of authoritarians and money, and politics—seems to be the common denominator,” the filmmaker tells Mehdi. 

‘2073’ depicts the confluence of climate change and the rise of authoritarianism in the dystopian city of New San Francisco, where there’s no privacy, no freedom, no democracy. The film is a warning of what is to come if we let oligarchs go unchecked. Watch the exclusive clip from the film at the end of the interview.

# ‘The Whole World Feels Really Dystopian’: Filmmaker Discusses the Global Push to Authoritarianism
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [February 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs)
*  It's hard for us to see into the future, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=0.0s)]
*  but the film 2073 gives us a look [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1.8s)]
*  at just one of the possibilities. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=4.04s)]
*  A world almost unrecognizable as citizens of new San Francisco [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=6.08s)]
*  face the fall of democracy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=10.68s)]
*  and the harrowing effects of climate change. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=12.08s)]
*  Sound familiar? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  This genre-bending documentary imagines the future [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=16.28s)]
*  based on what is happening today, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=19.8s)]
*  looking at the rise of billionaires, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=21.2s)]
*  fascistic leaders, unchecked capitalism, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  and, of course, mass surveillance. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=25.6s)]
*  From the US to India to the UK, Israel and more, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  with prominent writers and journalists [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  sharing their experiences and fears. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=33.32s)]
*  It's a chilling journey into the future [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=36.56s)]
*  with no privacy, no freedom, no democracy, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=38.2s)]
*  and, frankly, a warning of what is to come [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  if we let oligarchs go unchecked. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=42.8s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  is the award-winning British director of this documentary, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Arsif Kapadia, who you may know from documentaries [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=49.92s)]
*  such as Senna, Amy and Diego Maradona. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=52.28s)]
*  Arsif, thank you so much for coming on May the Unfiltered. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=55.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. Good to be talking to you. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=58.760000000000005s)]
*  As I just said there in the intro, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=60.88s)]
*  you're best known for your films about real-life people [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=63.24s)]
*  and their stories, Etten Senna, Amy Winehouse, Diego Maradona. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=66.48s)]
*  But 2073 is very different. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=70.28s)]
*  What called you to make this particular film [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=72.28s)]
*  to focus on this particular global phenomenon [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=76.28s)]
*  rather than a real person? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=79.68s)]
*  With this particular film, I had a feeling. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=82.48s)]
*  I just had a feeling of what was going on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=85.16s)]
*  and what was happening around the world. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=86.8s)]
*  And I felt I needed to do something. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=88.2s)]
*  You know, I'm a filmmaker. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=90.6s)]
*  The only thing I know is how to make movies. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=91.8s)]
*  So what I've done is, previously I've made fiction films. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=93.6s)]
*  I did a film, The Warrior. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  I did Far North. I've worked on TV shows. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=97.6s)]
*  And I've made the docs that you mentioned. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=99.39999999999999s)]
*  With this film, I thought the whole world feels really dystopian. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  Everything that happens every day that I read, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=104.8s)]
*  everything I see happening around me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=106.6s)]
*  And I thought, well, how do I express this feeling, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=108.4s)]
*  this fear about where we're heading? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=110.6s)]
*  I started a film in 2020, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=112.8s)]
*  and so my feeling was if I can frame it somehow in a movie, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=115.2s)]
*  using drama and documentary, and set it in the near future. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=118.0s)]
*  People have read books or seen movies or TV series, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=121.8s)]
*  and they can sort of take it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=124.6s)]
*  But my feeling with this one was, what I'm going to do is, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=126.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you the future, but using elements of the present. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=128.4s)]
*  And that's where archive comes in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=131.4s)]
*  And 2073, as you mentioned, is a hybrid film, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=134.2s)]
*  It blends a sci-fi narrative with contemporary documentary footage [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=137.4s)]
*  that becomes archive in the film. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=141.6s)]
*  What made you want to blend those two modes of storytelling? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=143.4s)]
*  I just thought it was the right way to do it, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=148.0s)]
*  because I knew there wasn't going to be a central character. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=149.8s)]
*  My aim with this film was to kind of almost have a God's eye view [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=152.0s)]
*  of the whole world. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=155.8s)]
*  Because my background is from India, I've worked in Brazil, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=157.0s)]
*  I've worked in Europe, I live in the UK, I've worked in the US. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=159.8s)]
*  I just saw the same kind of elements, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=163.6s)]
*  the same playbook happening everywhere. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=165.8s)]
*  And I just thought, it's happening everywhere at the same time. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=168.0s)]
*  Am I going crazy, or should I speak to some people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  and when our government here said that the people are tired of experts, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=173.2s)]
*  I like experts, I spoke to experts, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=176.6s)]
*  I spoke to a lot of brilliant journalists, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  people who are experts in democracy, to break down a democracy, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  surveillance, tech, the climate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  And I just said, look, is it me or is something going on? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=186.6s)]
*  And all of them said, no, there's something happening. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  And it's all happening right now everywhere. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  And the thing that kind of is, in a way, pushing it and magnifying it [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=193.0s)]
*  was tech, was social media, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=198.0s)]
*  was the way that information has been spread [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=201.0s)]
*  and pushing us in certain directions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  And so I thought, OK, I'm going to put this into a movie, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  but I don't have a central character on purpose. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=207.8s)]
*  So the central character, in a way, in the spine comes from the fiction. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=210.0s)]
*  I wrote that to put it in, to give us something to cling onto [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=214.0s)]
*  as we fly around the world with these little time capsules [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=217.0s)]
*  that we created of archive events. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=220.0s)]
*  And it's done very smartly. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned stuff that happens everywhere that you were noticing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=224.60000000000002s)]
*  Obviously, the climate crisis is something happening literally globally. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=227.0s)]
*  The film highlights the aftermath, if we can call it that, of a climate crisis, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=230.8s)]
*  showing us the dystopian city of new San Francisco, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  where Americans have tried to rebuild. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  The city has this Big Brother feel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=239.6s)]
*  There are drones, surveillance systems, even robot police dogs [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=242.20000000000002s)]
*  that we've seen in places like New York, I think, rolled out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=246.0s)]
*  How does the climate crisis exacerbate the rise of authoritarianism [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  and the surveillance? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=254.20000000000002s)]
*  It's not a natural link that everyone draws, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=255.4s)]
*  that climate change will exacerbate fascism and the surveillance state. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=257.8s)]
*  With people I spoke to, it's almost like if you can get people to believe [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  that humans are not affecting the climate, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=267.20000000000005s)]
*  you can get them to believe anything. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=269.20000000000005s)]
*  If you can say, it's got nothing to do with fossil fuels, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=270.8s)]
*  it's got nothing, we should dig more, we should make more money from that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=273.8s)]
*  The same people are saying, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=276.8s)]
*  and actually don't believe this, believe that, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  and this is not up, this is down. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=280.0s)]
*  So that's what I found. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=281.8s)]
*  And I think mostly people make these films [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  and they sit in little boxes like this is a climate film. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=285.4s)]
*  This is a film about a particular bad actor in one country. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=288.0s)]
*  And this is another film about something else. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=291.0s)]
*  And I just thought, well, it's all the same thing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  So can I put it all into one movie? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=294.8s)]
*  That was the idea. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=296.8s)]
*  And the footage that we show of New San Francisco, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=297.8s)]
*  we show in the US, from forest fires, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=300.8s)]
*  from the fact that you'll never see the sun again, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=303.4s)]
*  basically it's all red, the red skies, all of that's real. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=305.8s)]
*  I haven't manipulated that footage. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=308.8s)]
*  That only happened a few years ago. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=310.2s)]
*  And then what happens with a film like this is when you make it, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=312.2s)]
*  it came out at the end of last year, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=314.8s)]
*  just as the election was happening in the US, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=316.8s)]
*  just as people are watching the film, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=318.8s)]
*  as the fires were happening just now in California. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=320.6s)]
*  And you realise we've been warned about all this stuff. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  It happens again and again, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=326.0s)]
*  and it's happening quicker and quicker. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's all linked. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=329.2s)]
*  The same people are telling you there's no problem over here. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=330.2s)]
*  Blame someone else. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=332.2s)]
*  Or the same people saying there's no problem over here. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  Blame immigrants or blame Mexicans or blame people on boats. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=335.2s)]
*  Are the people destroying your life? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=338.8s)]
*  The film focuses on a bunch of different things [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=341.8s)]
*  that will lead to the collapse of society as we know it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=344.8s)]
*  Climate change, we mentioned, the financial crisis, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=347.8s)]
*  the refugee crisis, the rise of technology, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=350.8s)]
*  libertarian tech bros, the list goes on and on. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=352.8s)]
*  I wonder, of all those issues, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=354.8s)]
*  as you're making this film and speaking to experts, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=356.8s)]
*  what concerns you the most? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=358.8s)]
*  What do you deem to be the most urgent one [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=360.8s)]
*  that we need to really be focused on? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=362.8s)]
*  I think the big one is, and it's happening, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=364.8s)]
*  I don't even know if we can stop it, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=367.8s)]
*  but it's the takeover of authoritarians. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=369.8s)]
*  And money in politics seems to feed the common denominator. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=371.8s)]
*  For me, the film began with Brexit, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=375.8s)]
*  what happened here in the UK, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=377.8s)]
*  and the idea that people can be kind of lied to [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=379.8s)]
*  and tricked and fooled into making their lives worse. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=381.8s)]
*  Take away their own freedom. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=383.8s)]
*  Vote to kind of be poorer. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=385.8s)]
*  And blame foreigners. Blame immigrants. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=387.8s)]
*  Blame everyone else. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=389.8s)]
*  But then not the people who kind of tricked you into doing it, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=391.8s)]
*  they've all got European passports. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=393.8s)]
*  So Brexit was the beginning of it for me, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=395.8s)]
*  thinking what is going on? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=397.8s)]
*  Why are the journalists not questioning these people properly? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=399.8s)]
*  The same people that when someone who denies there's a climate issue [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=401.8s)]
*  will come on television and then there'll be one person saying [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=405.8s)]
*  there's no problem, only one person saying, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=407.8s)]
*  oh no, there is a problem, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=409.8s)]
*  rather than 500 people saying there's a problem [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=411.8s)]
*  and one person denying it. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=413.8s)]
*  It was never even, I was watching the news [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=415.8s)]
*  and watching the way it was being presented, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=417.8s)]
*  and I just kept thinking, am I going mad? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=419.8s)]
*  Why is this happening? Why are they getting away with it? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=421.8s)]
*  I went from being in the UK just after Brexit [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=423.8s)]
*  to being in the US and shooting in Pittsburgh [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=425.8s)]
*  on a TV show, Mindhunter, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=427.8s)]
*  during the Clinton-Trump election. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=429.8s)]
*  And I just was watching the shows each night [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=431.8s)]
*  and the same language was being used. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=433.8s)]
*  The same kind of phrases were being used. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=435.8s)]
*  And the same people were on the stage. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=437.8s)]
*  Nigel Farage was standing behind Trump. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=439.8s)]
*  And I kept thinking, what's he doing there? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=441.8s)]
*  I didn't know they all knew each other. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=443.8s)]
*  And this is before I'd read anything in The Guardian, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=445.8s)]
*  anything in The New York Times. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=447.8s)]
*  I was seeing the connections between Brexit [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=449.8s)]
*  and what was happening with Trump. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=451.8s)]
*  Back in 2016. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=453.8s)]
*  So I kept thinking, oh, this is... [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=455.8s)]
*  something's happening. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=457.8s)]
*  My background being from India, I was aware of Modi [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=459.8s)]
*  from a long time. Yes. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=461.8s)]
*  And what's been happening in Gujarat and what's happened [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=463.8s)]
*  across India, the more he divided people, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=465.8s)]
*  the more popular he became using social media. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=467.8s)]
*  So all of these things were in my head. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=469.8s)]
*  So really, it's the breakdown of democracy [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=471.8s)]
*  and the push to authoritarianism, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=473.8s)]
*  which I guess is the biggest issue. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=475.8s)]
*  Everything else is linked to that. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=477.8s)]
*  Very well put. And, yes, I've been banging on it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=479.8s)]
*  Obviously, I'm also descended from... [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=481.8s)]
*  I'm the child of Indian immigrants to the UK. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=483.8s)]
*  The Modi playbook, the Orban playbook, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=485.8s)]
*  the Erdogan playbook, the Putin playbook, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=487.8s)]
*  there is a global playbook. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=489.8s)]
*  Trump is not unique in this stuff. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=491.8s)]
*  He's drawing on what's already been done elsewhere. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=493.8s)]
*  One of the journalists, Rana, said to me, Medhi, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=495.8s)]
*  she said, it's like they're almost all on a WhatsApp group. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=497.8s)]
*  Guess what I just did? Yes. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=499.8s)]
*  You did? Yeah, and it worked. No one stopped us. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=501.8s)]
*  You should try it. Very well put. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=503.8s)]
*  That's Rana Ayub, the Indian Muslim journalist [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=505.8s)]
*  who writes also for The Washington Post. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=507.8s)]
*  Fantastic woman. Let me ask you this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=509.8s)]
*  You mentioned Rana, who's a great journalist. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=511.8s)]
*  I've had her on previous shows of mine. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=513.8s)]
*  You mentioned watching stuff in 2016 being in the US. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=515.8s)]
*  You are a documentary maker, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=517.8s)]
*  a filmmaker, an artist. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=519.8s)]
*  You're not a news journalist, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=521.8s)]
*  but obviously you're part of the media. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=523.8s)]
*  What do you make of the mainstream media's coverage [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=525.8s)]
*  of the issues you're highlighting in the film? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=527.8s)]
*  Did you feel you had to make 2073? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=529.8s)]
*  Because people aren't drawing the connections [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=531.8s)]
*  that you're seeing and drawing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=533.8s)]
*  How much is mainstream media, the New York Times, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=535.8s)]
*  even the Liberal media, The Guardian, the New York Times, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=537.8s)]
*  the BBC, how much has it failed us? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=539.8s)]
*  I think it has. I think somewhere along the way [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=543.8s)]
*  all of them have been kind of pushed and manipulated. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=545.8s)]
*  People have been put in upstairs [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=547.8s)]
*  and you just see [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=549.8s)]
*  that there's been a shift. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=551.8s)]
*  You know, I'm old enough to see that [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=553.8s)]
*  shift happening and the change [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=555.8s)]
*  from the people that are allowed on. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=557.8s)]
*  Carol Cadwallader, for example, has never been on a BBC. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=559.8s)]
*  I mean, she came on once on Breakfast TV. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=561.8s)]
*  That was it. But then [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=563.8s)]
*  Roger Farage, who was unelected, would have been [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=565.8s)]
*  25 times on Question Time, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=567.8s)]
*  which is the big kind of political show. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=569.8s)]
*  And you're just like, well, why is he on? He's unelected. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=571.8s)]
*  Why is he constantly being highlighted [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=573.8s)]
*  and given a position to keep speaking [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=575.8s)]
*  to a huge audience? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=577.8s)]
*  He finally got elected, I think, in the seventh attempt, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=579.8s)]
*  thanks to probably the BBC platforming him [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=581.8s)]
*  endlessly for years. But that's helped. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=583.8s)]
*  The truth is, the BBC, which I grew up [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=585.8s)]
*  loving, I travel a lot, I listen to [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=587.8s)]
*  the World Service, I love the news, I love it. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=589.8s)]
*  And then something has changed [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=591.8s)]
*  and I feel like, you know, you could see the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=593.8s)]
*  editorial policy kind of [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=595.8s)]
*  was affected and changed. And I [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=597.8s)]
*  think it's the same in the US, it's the same [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=599.8s)]
*  everywhere. So you're right, you know, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=601.8s)]
*  journalists are not doing the job it felt like, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=603.8s)]
*  or they're being pressured from above [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=605.8s)]
*  to save things from a certain slant. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=607.8s)]
*  And a lot of journalists, therefore, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=609.8s)]
*  leave those organisations. And [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=611.8s)]
*  that's the problem. Once you leave, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=613.8s)]
*  everything gets fragmented. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=615.8s)]
*  You yourself have had an experience, which maybe [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=617.8s)]
*  you can talk about. So I've found this [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=619.8s)]
*  with lots of journalists around the world, that if you [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=621.8s)]
*  do kind of try to hold power to [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=623.8s)]
*  account, including news organisations, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=625.8s)]
*  it may become uncomfortable [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=627.8s)]
*  for you to remain in that news organisation. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=629.8s)]
*  That's a very fair point. Let [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=631.8s)]
*  me ask you this. A lot of people, I mean, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=633.8s)]
*  look, the media's failing, and then you've [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=635.8s)]

*  Musk shouting every day, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=639.8s)]
*  you are the media now, he says to his followers. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=641.8s)]
*  You are the media. The mainstream media doesn't exist. They're all [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=643.8s)]
*  liars. You are the media. And yet, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=645.8s)]
*  the people who control these social [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=647.8s)]
*  media platforms are all now right-wing [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=649.8s)]
*  partisan hacks. They show up at the inauguration [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=651.8s)]
*  of Donald Trump on Monday. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=653.8s)]
*  They get better seats than Donald [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=655.8s)]
*  Trump's own cabinet members. They're all [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=657.8s)]
*  in the tank for the Republican Party, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=659.8s)]
*  for MAGA and Trump. Where does that leave us, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=661.8s)]
*  then, if the most powerful, influential, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=663.8s)]
*  fastest growing form of communication, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=665.8s)]
*  social media, Twitter, Instagram, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=667.8s)]
*  TikTok, all under the control [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=669.8s)]
*  of Trump partisans? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=671.8s)]
*  I think it's pretty scary. I think all of the kind of [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=675.8s)]
*  gut feelings that I had when I started [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=677.8s)]
*  this film, what's happened is by the time [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=679.8s)]
*  the film comes out, it's all happening. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=681.8s)]
*  In the film, we have this kind of moment when we [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=683.8s)]
*  shifted from the way the world used to be, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=685.8s)]
*  kind of this idea of democracy was everywhere [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=687.8s)]
*  and spreading, and it was a good thing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=689.8s)]
*  to this idea of authoritarians who [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=691.8s)]
*  have taken over and control [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=693.8s)]
*  all of our kind of existence. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=695.8s)]
*  And we call it the event. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=697.8s)]
*  And I feel like we're in that moment. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=699.8s)]
*  Every day, some of our freedom is removed. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=701.8s)]
*  Something else is changing. Some law comes in. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=703.8s)]
*  The idea of peacefully protesting becomes illegal. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=705.8s)]
*  The idea of having a Zoom call [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=707.8s)]
*  to talk about the idea [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=709.8s)]
*  of doing some sort of protest [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=711.8s)]
*  because you're worried about the climate [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=713.8s)]
*  can lead to you going to jail for five years [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=715.8s)]
*  just by talking about it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=717.8s)]
*  Just by having a Zoom call, you can end up in prison. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=719.8s)]
*  So I feel like we're in a moment [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=721.8s)]
*  of change and in a moment where [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=723.8s)]
*  those of us who have an opportunity need [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=725.8s)]
*  to be speaking up as much as we can. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=727.8s)]
*  The thing that I've always found, which I don't like, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=729.8s)]
*  is when people say the next generation, they're great. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=731.8s)]
*  They'll fix all of our mistakes. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=733.8s)]
*  And I'm like, it might be too late. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=735.8s)]
*  We're the grownups. We have to do something. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=737.8s)]
*  We have to speak up. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=739.8s)]
*  Because we're old enough to remember what life was like [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=741.8s)]
*  before the tech companies. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=743.8s)]
*  We have seen the shift. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=745.8s)]
*  There was a life before that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=747.8s)]
*  There was a time when I could travel freely in Europe. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=749.8s)]
*  And I cannot anymore. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=751.8s)]
*  Someone sold you that lie. Someone sold that to you. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=753.8s)]
*  And to begin with, maybe get off those apps. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=755.8s)]
*  It's a very good point about [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=757.8s)]
*  the life before social media. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=759.8s)]
*  I've never known a life without it. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=761.8s)]
*  I'm glad I did know a life without it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=763.8s)]
*  I'm an addict now, but at least I wasn't once. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=765.8s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=767.8s)]
*  You have to get your kids to look at your screen time [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=769.8s)]
*  and see whether you're online. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=771.8s)]
*  My kids warn me all the time that I'm online too much. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=773.8s)]
*  I'm an addict. What can I do? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=775.8s)]
*  You mentioned that you [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=777.8s)]
*  started making the film in 2020. Is that correct? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=779.8s)]
*  Is that what you said earlier? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=781.8s)]
*  During lockdown, yeah. I was stuck at home and I just thought [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=783.8s)]
*  something's going on. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=785.8s)]
*  But did you think as you're making it in 2020, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=787.8s)]
*  the election happens? Trump loses. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=789.8s)]
*  There's a moment, there's a window [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=791.8s)]
*  where you think, all right, fascism has been [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=793.8s)]
*  pushed back. People have recovered their [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=795.8s)]
*  senses. Joe Biden was talking about uniting [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=797.8s)]
*  the country, healing the country, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=799.8s)]
*  winning the battle for the soul of America. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=801.8s)]
*  That didn't turn out so well for him. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=803.8s)]
*  But in 2020, do you think, well, actually I don't need [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=805.8s)]
*  to make this film now. We've turned a corner. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=807.8s)]
*  We're on a path away from this. And yet here we [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=809.8s)]
*  are four years later, back to Trump 2.0. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=811.8s)]
*  Yeah, that came up a lot while [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=815.8s)]
*  making a film. That came up in my finances. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=817.8s)]
*  It came up with lots of notes and a lot of the notes, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=819.8s)]
*  particularly from my US execs, were [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=821.8s)]
*  why is Trump in the film? Take him out. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=823.8s)]
*  He's old news. People are sick of hearing about it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=825.8s)]
*  And I kept thinking of the film [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=827.8s)]
*  as a time capsule. Each sequence [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=829.8s)]
*  is a moment of time. And essentially, it's our [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=831.8s)]
*  last decade, right? All of this [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=833.8s)]
*  happened in the last 10 years. You have [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=835.8s)]
*  the financial crisis, 9-11 [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=837.8s)]
*  financial crisis are the two key points [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=839.8s)]
*  that seem like the world changed, particularly from the [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=841.8s)]
*  US point of view. But it affected everyone. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=843.8s)]
*  And I just thought, well, even if [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=845.8s)]
*  he's gone, the people who believed in him [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=847.8s)]
*  and who voted for him are still there. The people who [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=849.8s)]
*  supported him are still there. So [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=851.8s)]
*  even if that's changed, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=853.8s)]
*  there's still a group of people [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=855.8s)]
*  which is half of the population [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=857.8s)]
*  in the US who believed in that. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=859.8s)]
*  So for me, it just felt like [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=861.8s)]
*  it's still relevant. It's still important to show [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=863.8s)]
*  what was going on and what was happening [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=865.8s)]
*  around the world and the common themes. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=867.8s)]
*  And of course, no one really knew what was going to happen. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=869.8s)]
*  But by the time the election comes around again, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=871.8s)]
*  and that's how long it takes me to make a movie, you could say [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=873.8s)]
*  it's basically one election cycle. I started [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=875.8s)]
*  a film and it was motivated [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=877.8s)]
*  by the Trump election in 2016. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=879.8s)]
*  I started a film in 2020. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=881.8s)]
*  By the time it comes around, this circle [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=883.8s)]
*  just keeps spinning. You're going to go [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=885.8s)]
*  ping-ponging from one version, one [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=887.8s)]
*  party to the other, and one party and [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=889.8s)]
*  back again. And I don't know [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=891.8s)]
*  what's going to change in the US unless [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=893.8s)]
*  the political system changes, unless the way [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=895.8s)]
*  you vote changes, because I can just see [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=897.8s)]
*  this continuing on. And whatever happens in the US, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=899.8s)]
*  there's always a trickle down to the rest of the world. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=901.8s)]
*  If the richest and most powerful [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=903.8s)]
*  people are, and the tech guys are all in [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=905.8s)]
*  power now, then that will affect [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=907.8s)]
*  me. That affects everyone all over the world. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=909.8s)]
*  In the Philippines, in India, in Latin America, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=911.8s)]
*  in Africa, we're all affected [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=913.8s)]
*  by these tech companies. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=915.8s)]
*  And there's a battle [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=917.8s)]
*  going on which is different. And I think the idea that we're all [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=919.8s)]
*  in sync now, I don't think that's going away [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=921.8s)]
*  in a hurry. I think that's normal now. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=923.8s)]
*  I think that I don't see how we can ever go [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=925.8s)]
*  back to life before that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=927.8s)]
*  You start and end the film the same way [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=929.8s)]
*  with a message from the main character in this dystopian [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=931.8s)]
*  2073 world. She writes, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=933.8s)]
*  I hope someone finds this. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=935.8s)]
*  No one said or did anything to stop them. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=937.8s)]
*  It's too late for me. I was alone. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=939.8s)]
*  It may not be too late for you. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=941.8s)]
*  Is there still [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=943.8s)]
*  hope for us? How do we [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=945.8s)]
*  reverse the democratic [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=947.8s)]
*  backsliding, the fossil [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=949.8s)]
*  fuel endless burning, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=951.8s)]
*  the social media addictions? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=953.8s)]
*  You're a hopeful person? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=955.8s)]
*  As a person, I'm very positive. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=957.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm an eternal optimist. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=959.8s)]
*  But you're allowed to be an eternal [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=961.8s)]
*  optimist, but also be realist [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=963.8s)]
*  and look at what's happening and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=965.8s)]
*  can see the signs and how it's [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=967.8s)]
*  affecting you and affecting people around you. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=969.8s)]
*  And I think the reason I wanted [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=971.8s)]
*  to make the film partly was [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=973.8s)]
*  to connect the dots for an audience. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=975.8s)]
*  If you've had a kind of gut feeling, something [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=977.8s)]
*  was going on, you see the film, I'm hoping [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=979.8s)]
*  I might have explained something a bit [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=981.8s)]
*  more in detail or shown you [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=983.8s)]
*  things that you didn't know as well as the things you did [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=985.8s)]
*  know. And really, the film [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=987.8s)]
*  is there to create dialogue for us to be talking [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=989.8s)]
*  now. For you, for me, for everyone [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=991.8s)]
*  to be saying, well, what can we individually [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=993.8s)]
*  do? I don't think it's as simple [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=995.8s)]
*  as putting a neat little moment at the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=997.8s)]
*  end of the film and saying, if you do this, everything [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=999.8s)]
*  will be great. I think the struggle is much [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1001.8s)]
*  more complex and the fight for kind of [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1003.8s)]
*  freedom and democracy is much more [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1005.8s)]
*  layered than me just saying, go [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1007.8s)]
*  out and vote. There's something else going on [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1009.8s)]
*  here and we're going to have to talk about it. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1011.8s)]
*  And I think partly it starts at home. It starts with you, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1013.8s)]
*  it starts with your kids, it starts with your family, your [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1015.8s)]
*  parents, your aunties and your uncles. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1017.8s)]
*  But then also a kind of wider community [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1019.8s)]
*  about what are we going to do to protect ourselves from [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1021.8s)]
*  what is happening. We're not crazy. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1023.8s)]
*  This stuff is happening. And I think [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1025.8s)]
*  the film, part of the process of [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1027.8s)]
*  showing it has been almost like therapy for people. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1029.8s)]
*  We've had screenings, people come in and go, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1031.8s)]
*  yeah, I've been talking about this to my family and no one's [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1033.8s)]
*  listening to me. It's all happening. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1035.8s)]
*  So I feel like for you and me to be [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1037.8s)]
*  connected via this film, I see [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1039.8s)]
*  you talking to your group of people over there [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1041.8s)]
*  and I've been talking over here and I feel like [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1043.8s)]
*  the film is the excuse to get us saying, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1045.8s)]
*  this is serious. What are we going to do about it? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1047.8s)]
*  It is a great excuse. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1049.8s)]
*  It is a great film, a must watch documentary. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1051.8s)]
*  I urge everyone to go watch it. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1053.8s)]
*  2073.film. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1055.8s)]
*  If you're in the US, you can see how to watch it there. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1057.8s)]
*  If you're in the UK, it still has a theatrical run. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1059.8s)]
*  Check out the film, Us of Cappadia. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1061.8s)]
*  Thank you for making it and thank you for joining me today. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1063.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1065.8s)]
*  Really good to talk to you. Cheers. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1067.8s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1071.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1077.8s)]
*  There's a new set of kings that [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1087.8s)]
*  nobody voted for. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1089.8s)]
*  And they have more money [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1091.8s)]
*  and power than any corporation [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1093.8s)]
*  ever has. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1095.8s)]
*  Tesla boss Elon Musk is now the richest person [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1097.8s)]
*  in the world with a net worth of [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1099.8s)]
*  $185 billion. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1101.8s)]
*  Facebook's got [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1103.8s)]
*  $46 billion in cash. The cash [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1105.8s)]
*  flows somewhere around $10.5 billion. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1107.8s)]
*  Google's parent company Alphabet [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1109.8s)]
*  surged for the full year revenue rose [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1111.8s)]
*  to nearly $75 billion. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1113.8s)]
*  That now makes Alphabet the world's [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1115.8s)]
*  most valuable company ahead of Apple. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1117.8s)]
*  Just want to jump in with some Amazon [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1119.8s)]
*  numbers. Revenue, $89 billion. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1121.8s)]
*  They are powerful not simply because [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1125.8s)]
*  they have all the money and the wealth, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1127.8s)]
*  but because they've amassed all of the information. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1129.8s)]
*  Age, gender, ethnicity, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1131.8s)]
*  religion, what car you drive, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1133.8s)]
*  what products you purchase in shops, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1135.8s)]
*  what churches you attend, how you see the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1137.8s)]
*  world, what actually drives you, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1139.8s)]
*  how open you are to new experiences, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1141.8s)]
*  whether you prefer order and habits [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1143.8s)]
*  and planning in your life, how social you are, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1145.8s)]
*  how much you tend to worry. Big data [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1147.8s)]
*  is an understanding of your personality [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1149.8s)]
*  because it's personality [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1151.8s)]
*  that drives behavior. And behavior [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1153.8s)]
*  obviously influences how you vote. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1155.8s)]
*  These technology companies have [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1159.8s)]
*  become behavior modification [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1161.8s)]
*  systems for sale [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1163.8s)]
*  to the highest [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1165.8s)]
*  bidder. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1167.8s)]
*  We are worth more [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1171.8s)]
*  when we are dead slabs of predictable [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1173.8s)]
*  human behavior than when [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1175.8s)]
*  we are as living, breathing, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1177.8s)]
*  informed citizens of a democracy. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1179.8s)]
*  We are worth more when we are addicted, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1181.8s)]
*  outraged, distracted, polarized, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1183.8s)]
*  and disinformed than if we [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1185.8s)]
*  are living, breathing, free [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1187.8s)]
*  humans and citizens. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1189.8s)]
*  Technology domesticates us [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1191.8s)]
*  into the new kind of human. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1193.8s)]
*  The last time human beings were commodified [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1197.8s)]
*  it was the age of industrialization [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1199.8s)]
*  and it was labor. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1201.8s)]
*  And when labor was commodified [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1203.8s)]
*  we had sweatshops, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1205.8s)]
*  we had factory lines, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1207.8s)]
*  we had child labor, we had [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1209.8s)]
*  exploitation of our [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1211.8s)]
*  physical bodies. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1213.8s)]
*  Now, what's commodified is not our [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1217.8s)]
*  physical bodies, it's our [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1219.8s)]
*  attention. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1221.8s)]
*  So what are they going to do next? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1227.8s)]
*  Your support matters. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45gUZVp8Kxs&t=1241.8s)]
