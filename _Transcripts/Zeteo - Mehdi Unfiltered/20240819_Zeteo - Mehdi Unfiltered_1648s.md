Video Description: Mehdi Hasan interviews Ami Ayalon, the former head of Israel's Security Service, Shin Bet, and the ex-commander of the Israeli Navy, in the latest episode of ‘Mehdi Unfiltered.’

Ayalon discusses why he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and far right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir pose a threat to Israeli democracy, calls for an end to the occupation, and explains why he would resist Israel if he were Palestinian.

As reports of Israeli torture and abuse against detained Palestinians continue to emerge, Hasan also challenges Ayalon on allegations of torture under Shin Bet during his tenure. The former security chief admits he has "many regrets."

# Former Israeli Spy Chief: If I Was A Palestinian, I Would Fight Against Israel’s Occupation
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU)
*  Torturing and raping prisoners is a war crime, is it not, Amir Aylan? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=0.0s)]
*  It is a war crime. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=4.32s)]
*  If you'd been born Palestinian, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=6.08s)]
*  would you have joined up with Hamas to fight against your occupiers? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=8.2s)]
*  Not with Hamas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=11.8s)]
*  If I would be a Palestinian, I would fight against the Israeli occupation. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=13.0s)]
*  Do you have any regrets for the torture that was carried out by Shin Bet [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=16.88s)]
*  when you were in charge? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=19.88s)]
*  I have many regrets. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=21.16s)]
*  Who, in your view, are the more existential threats to your country? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=22.64s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah or Netanyahu and Ben-Gavir? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  Have you seen what's happening in Israel? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=37.68s)]
*  Not just accusations of gang rape by Israeli soldiers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=39.84s)]
*  against Palestinians in detention, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=42.92s)]
*  but riots to try and free those arrested soldiers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Add torture and rape to the list of war crimes [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  the Israeli government is accused of. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  And it's not just the ICC chief prosecutor or human rights groups [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=53.24s)]
*  that have lined up to criticise Israel's government [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=56.84s)]
*  and its conduct of this war. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  Some of the biggest critics of Benjamin Netanyahu and Itamar Ben-Gavir [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  are former Israeli military officials. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  One of them is my guest today, Amir Aylan, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=67.4s)]
*  who served as the head of Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=70.08s)]
*  in the late 1990s and previously was commander of Israel's navy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=73.56s)]
*  Early on in the war, Aylan called on Prime Minister Netanyahu to resign, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=77.68s)]
*  writing that Netanyahu is, quote, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  unfit to direct any part of this process, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  neither the war to defeat Hamas, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=85.72s)]
*  nor efforts to secure a more lasting peace. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=87.48s)]
*  Throughout the war, Aylan has insisted on giving Palestinians [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  a new political horizon, he says, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=93.48s)]
*  and advocates for a two-state solution. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=95.64s)]
*  He's the recipient of Israel's highest military honour, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=97.72s)]
*  the Medal of Valour, a former minister in the Israeli government, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=99.84s)]
*  and is the author of the book Friendly Fire, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=102.84s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=105.12s)]
*  Amir Aylan, thank you for joining me on Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  Early in the war, you co-authored a piece for Foreign Affairs [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  titled Why Netanyahu Must Go. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=114.0s)]
*  As the former head of Israel's security service, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  what made you want to make such a provocative intervention so early on? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=119.64s)]
*  Well, when it comes to Netanyahu, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=126.16s)]
*  I'm saying it for the last more than 18 months [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=128.32s)]
*  since he created this very extreme right-wing coalition, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=132.6s)]
*  and he let Ben-Gur and Smotrich to lead Israeli policies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=138.48s)]
*  So, it's not new. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=144.6s)]
*  I didn't say it only after the 7th of October. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=146.76s)]
*  I think that, first of all, he himself, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=150.44s)]
*  he's in a conflict of interest, he's on trial. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=153.32s)]
*  And the way it seems to me, he prefers his own, well, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=157.92s)]
*  his own future on the future of the state of Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=165.88s)]
*  Just on Netanyahu and Hamas, pre-October 7th, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  do you believe Netanyahu was deliberately propping up Hamas in Gaza [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=176.76s)]
*  as a way of dividing Palestinians and preventing a two-state solution? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=181.4s)]
*  Well, his policy, and he didn't hide it, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  he's totally against the reality [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=192.4s)]
*  in which there is a Palestinian state alongside Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=194.96s)]
*  He said it, his policy, the way he explained it, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=198.96s)]
*  is divided control to make sure [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=204.24s)]
*  that Palestinians will not have a unified government. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  And the only way to do it was to do everything [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=210.52s)]
*  in order to maintain Hamas in power, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=216.20000000000002s)]
*  even if it was necessary to approve [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=219.68s)]
*  sending more than probably $1.5 billion from Qatar. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=225.76s)]
*  And every time when the security leaders, military and the Shin Bet, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=235.36s)]
*  came to him and told him, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=242.4s)]
*  look, Hamas will not control his violence. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=243.68s)]
*  And the moment that he believes that he can launch a war or a battle, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  he will do it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=255.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=256.08s)]
*  So he did not approve it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  So it's not a secret. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=258.08s)]
*  Yes, this was his formal policy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=259.68s)]
*  He did everything in order to increase the power of Hamas [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=262.16s)]
*  and to make sure that Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=265.92s)]
*  will not be able to create a unified government. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=272.4s)]
*  So isn't the problem, Amir Ayalon, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=276.88s)]
*  that even if Benjamin Netanyahu would listen to you [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=278.96s)]
*  and quit and resign in shame, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=281.44s)]
*  the problem goes way beyond Netanyahu, Ben-Gavir and Smotrich. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=283.68s)]
*  According to Gallup, 65% of Israeli adults [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=286.96s)]
*  are currently against a two-state solution. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=289.76s)]
*  So Netanyahu disappears tomorrow. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=292.48s)]
*  Israeli society has still moved over the last decade or two [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=294.56s)]
*  since you started campaigning for a two-state solution [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=297.6s)]
*  way to the right. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=300.48s)]
*  What do you do in a society like that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=302.48s)]
*  when your fellow Israelis are not interested in the kind of deal [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=304.48s)]
*  you're pitching? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=307.04s)]
*  They don't agree with you? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  I present a political horizon. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=312.0s)]
*  I can give you the most important example. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=318.16s)]
*  If you would ask Israelis during the first Intifada [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=322.16s)]
*  whether they agree to negotiate with Palestinians, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  we would tell you that you are crazy, lunatic or whatever, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=330.96000000000004s)]
*  because we hated them and we were sure that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=335.6s)]
*  they will do everything in order to destroy Israel. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=340.24s)]
*  And we did not understand why they are doing it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=345.04s)]
*  But this is history. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=349.20000000000005s)]
*  The moment that a new horizon and Oslo process was presented, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=350.72s)]
*  it was a dramatic change in the Israeli street [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=358.24s)]
*  and among Palestinians. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  So I believe in presenting new ideas. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=367.52000000000004s)]
*  I think that Israelis and Palestinians today, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=373.52000000000004s)]
*  we hate each other. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=376.40000000000003s)]
*  We are confused. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=378.88s)]
*  We are humiliated, both sides. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=379.92s)]
*  And yes, nothing good will come from Israeli leadership [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=382.96s)]
*  and Palestinian leadership. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  Most Israelis do not believe that all Palestinians are Hamas [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  and most Palestinians believe that all Israelis [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=398.47999999999996s)]
*  are Smotrich and Ben-Gur and Netanyahu. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=400.96s)]
*  And it is totally wrong. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  By the way, you said something about polls. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  75% of Israelis—and the question is how do you present the question— [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=409.28s)]
*  75% of Israelis will agree to stop the war [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  and to create what we call the regional coalition that will face Iran. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=421.03999999999996s)]
*  We understand that the condition in order to ignite this process [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  will present a future for a Palestinian state. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=436.0s)]
*  But we support it on the condition that all our hostages will be back [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=441.84s)]
*  and this coalition will be created in the support of America, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=448.96s)]
*  of course, the Saudi Arabia, etc. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=453.91999999999996s)]
*  So polls are very, very tricky. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=456.64s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=459.67999999999995s)]
*  You mentioned Iran. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=460.96s)]
*  Last week, Israel not only killed the Hamas leader Ismail Hanir [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  while he was in Iran, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=466.88s)]
*  but they also killed the top Hezbollah commander in Beirut. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=467.84s)]
*  As the former head of the Israeli security service, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=470.88s)]
*  as a former Israeli Navy chief, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=473.67999999999995s)]
*  tell me, in your view, Amir Ailon, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=475.91999999999996s)]
*  have those actions made Israel safer? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=477.84s)]
*  They are not making Israel safer. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=483.76s)]
*  I, you know, in certain cases—and I was in the Israeli Shilbet [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=486.0s)]
*  and what we call targeted killing was based on a condition [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=492.64s)]
*  in which we know that a terrorist is going to attack. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  Many Israelis will die and there is no other option to stop him. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=506.64s)]
*  We cannot arrest him. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=511.28s)]
*  We don't have the operational capability to do it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=512.96s)]
*  Today, of course, Israel is taking a totally different type of policy. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=519.0400000000001s)]
*  I think that too many Israelis and too many politicians [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  believe that by killing leaders, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  the ideology will be evaporated. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=533.36s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=536.1600000000001s)]
*  Yes, you said something very, very true. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=538.32s)]
*  By killing the leader, in our case, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=541.68s)]
*  ideology even will be deeper rooted within the Palestinian and Arab society. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=548.8s)]
*  So it's made Israel less safe from what you're saying? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=556.4s)]
*  I think that it is a mistake. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=559.12s)]
*  Has it made Israel less safe? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=560.72s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=562.48s)]
*  Has it made Israel less safe, those killings? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=563.52s)]
*  That's what it sounds like. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=566.24s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=566.88s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=568.64s)]
*  The only way to do it is to create this coalition [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=570.24s)]
*  and to present a different political horizon. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=575.28s)]
*  And there is a huge opportunity ahead of us. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=578.64s)]
*  After the 7th of October, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=582.88s)]
*  it is not a conflict only between Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=584.3199999999999s)]
*  It is a conflict, the regional conflict, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=587.68s)]
*  shaking the stability in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=590.4s)]
*  and with a global impact. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=594.56s)]
*  And it's also, Amir Allen, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=597.12s)]
*  it's also made Israel quite a bit of a pariah in the world. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=599.36s)]
*  People are questioning Israeli democracy, quote unquote. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=602.96s)]
*  You were protesting against the judicial reforms, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=605.68s)]
*  quote unquote, October the 7th. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=608.72s)]
*  So I want to ask you this question. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=611.2s)]
*  It is a serious question. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=612.8s)]
*  Who in your view are the bigger threats to Israeli democracy? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=614.4s)]
*  Who in your view are the more existential threats to your country? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=618.16s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah or Netanyahu and Ben-Gavir? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=622.32s)]
*  No, I wrote a book five years ago in English. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=627.12s)]
*  It was called How Israel Became its Worst Enemy [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=631.68s)]
*  and the Hope for its Future. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=635.2s)]
*  And it was translated to many languages, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=637.44s)]
*  in Poland, in Germany, in Israel. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=641.36s)]
*  I'm saying it because if you ask me, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=644.88s)]
*  yes, Netanyahu is present a huge, a huge danger to our democracy, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=649.84s)]
*  but it is beyond Netanyahu. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=655.92s)]
*  I think that too many Israelis do not understand [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=657.92s)]
*  that we shall not have security [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  unless we shall not stop the occupation [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=665.68s)]
*  and we shall not have democracy [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=671.28s)]
*  unless we shall end the occupation. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=674.7199999999999s)]
*  So let me ask you this. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=678.88s)]
*  For a lot of Israelis post-October the 7th, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=680.48s)]
*  Hamas is an ISIS-style group. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=682.8s)]
*  They think they're a bunch of religious messianic fanatics [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=684.88s)]
*  who hate Jews, want to kill all Jews, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=687.92s)]
*  who can't be appeased because they're just evil. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=690.0s)]
*  In your view, as someone who ran the security service, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=692.8s)]
*  is that the correct view of Hamas? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=695.36s)]
*  Or are they, in your view, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=697.68s)]
*  still, despite all the crimes they're accused of, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=699.36s)]
*  rational actors with political goals [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=702.08s)]
*  who can be negotiated with [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=704.48s)]
*  and whose threat to Israel can be dealt with [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=706.48s)]
*  via a political solution, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=708.4s)]
*  a diplomatic solution, not a military solution? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=709.92s)]
*  No, Hamas is not a partner to any negotiations, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=712.4799999999999s)]
*  but there is a huge difference between Hamas, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  especially when their leaders change the characters. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=719.12s)]
*  They are not Muslim Brotherhood anymore. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=723.28s)]
*  They are much more like ISIS or al-Qaeda. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=725.68s)]
*  The level of cruelty and violence, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=731.04s)]
*  many, many Muslims, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=734.7199999999999s)]
*  members in the Muslim Brotherhood [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  believe that they are traitors of Islam. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=740.48s)]
*  So Hamas is not a partner to anything, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=745.04s)]
*  but most Palestinians do not believe in Hamas. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=749.36s)]
*  And today they support Hamas, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  not because they believe in the future [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=755.12s)]
*  of Greater Palestine from the Jordan to the sea, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=758.0799999999999s)]
*  and not because they accept the vision [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=761.92s)]
*  of the future state of Palestine ruled by Sharia. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=764.48s)]
*  They support Hamas only because they see Hamas [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=770.48s)]
*  as the only player who fights for the freedom. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=779.04s)]
*  And this is the result of the policies [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=779.92s)]
*  that were was led by Netanyahu on one side, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=783.68s)]
*  and all the mistakes that all of us, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=786.72s)]
*  Israelis and Palestinians, did during the last 10 years. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=788.72s)]
*  On that note, Amir Aylan, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=791.52s)]
*  you are someone who spent your life [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=792.64s)]
*  fighting for your country in the Navy, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  in the Secret Service. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=795.76s)]
*  If you'd been born Palestinian, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=797.6s)]
*  would you have joined up with Hamas [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=799.68s)]
*  to fight against your occupiers? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=801.12s)]
*  Not with Hamas. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=803.36s)]
*  Not with Hamas. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=805.68s)]
*  I will never join Hamas. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=806.56s)]
*  But you would have violently resisted Israel? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=810.24s)]
*  No, I said in more than one interview, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=812.4s)]
*  even several days ago, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=815.92s)]
*  that if I would be a Palestinian, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=818.4s)]
*  I would fight against the Israeli occupation. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=820.56s)]
*  This is the way I understand Palestinians. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=823.2s)]
*  Palestinians see themselves as a nation, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=825.44s)]
*  and they want, they feel that they have [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=828.8800000000001s)]
*  the right to self-determination. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=831.7600000000001s)]
*  But I think that every Palestinian [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=834.0s)]
*  who will join Hamas is doing a huge mistake, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=836.72s)]
*  because Hamas couldn't care less [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=840.48s)]
*  about Palestinian people. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=843.12s)]
*  People do not see. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=848.8000000000001s)]
*  Hamas built in Gaza, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=850.48s)]
*  the hugest shelter on earth, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=853.28s)]
*  they could protect hundreds of thousands [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=856.9599999999999s)]
*  of Palestinians, but there is no entry [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=860.16s)]
*  to any civilian Palestinian. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  I want to come back to shelters [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=865.04s)]
*  and bombs in a moment. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=868.16s)]
*  Just on occupation, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=869.28s)]
*  it's not just an occupation. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  Many human rights groups, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=871.52s)]
*  including Israeli human rights groups, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=872.48s)]
*  say it's apartheid. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=873.76s)]
*  In 2012, you said in an interview [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=875.04s)]
*  with Charlie Rose that the ongoing occupation, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=876.9599999999999s)]
*  the lack of a two-state solution, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=879.36s)]
*  could lead to a, quote, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=881.04s)]
*  kind of apartheid. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=882.56s)]
*  Your words. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=883.68s)]
*  Surely 12 years later, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=884.7199999999999s)]
*  with no two-state solution, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=886.3199999999999s)]
*  even more settlements, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=887.68s)]
*  you must agree with every human rights group [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=889.28s)]
*  that there is apartheid [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=891.68s)]
*  in the occupied territories. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=892.8s)]
*  In the occupied territories, yes. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=894.9599999999999s)]
*  I do agree. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=897.52s)]
*  I'm saying it every day. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=899.12s)]
*  In the occupied territories, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=900.88s)]
*  the way I understand the whole concept [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=902.64s)]
*  of apartheid, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=905.5999999999999s)]
*  there are two different legal systems. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=908.0s)]
*  To Jews and to Palestinians [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=911.68s)]
*  who are living in the same place [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=914.24s)]
*  or the same territory. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=918.64s)]
*  And we cannot hide it. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  Unless we end the occupation, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=924.64s)]
*  it is penetrating into Israel. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=926.8s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=929.04s)]
*  And here's what's interesting, Amir A'ala. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=929.68s)]
*  A lot of Israelis do now say it's apartheid, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=931.36s)]
*  including former security chiefs like yourself. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=934.0799999999999s)]
*  But you can't just say it. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  Apartheid has legal implications. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=937.1999999999999s)]
*  Apartheid is a crime under international law. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=939.12s)]
*  And this is the problem right now [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=942.08s)]
*  with what Israel is doing. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=943.68s)]
*  There's a lot of accusations of illegality, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=945.12s)]
*  as you know, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=947.36s)]
*  since October the 7th in particular. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=947.92s)]
*  The ICC chief prosecutor [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=949.84s)]
*  has requested arrest warrants [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=951.44s)]
*  for Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=953.2s)]
*  and Defense Minister Gallant [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=954.48s)]
*  for war crimes, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=955.84s)]
*  for the intentional killing of civilians, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=956.96s)]
*  for using starvation as a weapon of war. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=958.88s)]
*  They have committed war crimes, have they not? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=961.28s)]
*  Do you support a request [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=963.04s)]
*  for arrest warrants against them? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=964.08s)]
*  I believe in negotiations. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=966.8s)]
*  And I believe in presenting a future [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=968.48s)]
*  of two-states solution for both sides. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  I cannot tell you [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=976.4s)]
*  that what we are doing today [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=979.6800000000001s)]
*  is a crime because it is in the middle of war. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=982.32s)]
*  And it is very, very difficult [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=987.76s)]
*  to take pieces or events within the war [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=990.16s)]
*  and to say, okay, you are committing a criminal crime. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=994.08s)]
*  Come on, Amir A'ala. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=997.28s)]
*  In every war, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=998.24s)]
*  in the middle of the Syria conflict, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=999.36s)]
*  we accuse Bashar al-Assad of war crimes. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1000.96s)]
*  In the middle of the Ukraine conflict, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1003.04s)]
*  we accuse Vladimir Putin of war crimes. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1004.5600000000001s)]
*  Why does Israel get special treatment? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1006.48s)]
*  Why can't human rights groups say, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1008.0s)]
*  as they are saying, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1009.52s)]
*  that Israel is committing war crimes [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1011.76s)]
*  by blowing up apartment buildings, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1013.2s)]
*  denying aid, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1015.28s)]
*  killing people with white flags, etc.? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1016.4s)]
*  No, all the events that you mentioned, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1019.6800000000001s)]
*  I totally disagree [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1022.88s)]
*  because you have to forget something. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1024.0s)]
*  That the war that we are fighting today [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1028.48s)]
*  is a totally different war [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1032.08s)]
*  than the international community [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1035.04s)]
*  is used to see as a war [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1037.6s)]
*  when they defined the law of war. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1039.76s)]
*  It is not a war between states. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1044.88s)]
*  It is a war against organization, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1047.2s)]
*  a criminal and a terrorist organization [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1050.24s)]
*  who couldn't care less about his people, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1053.28s)]
*  his own people. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1055.92s)]
*  It is the first time in history. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1056.72s)]
*  Hold on. You made that point. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1057.84s)]
*  You made that point, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1059.44s)]
*  but you are not dealing with the fact [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1060.08s)]
*  that we do accuse governments [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1061.6000000000001s)]
*  of committing war crimes [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1063.1200000000001s)]
*  when Vladimir Putin bombs a hospital. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1064.0s)]
*  Hold on. Let me finish my question. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  When Vladimir Putin bombs a hospital, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1067.04s)]
*  we say that is a war crime. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1068.64s)]
*  When Israel blows up an apartment building, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1069.92s)]
*  as they did in late October, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1071.68s)]
*  killing 104 people, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1072.96s)]
*  including 54 civilians, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1074.48s)]
*  and 54 children in an airstrike, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1076.24s)]
*  that is just one example, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1078.16s)]
*  we are able to say that is a war crime. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1079.52s)]
*  Are we not? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1080.88s)]
*  Israel is doing everything, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1081.52s)]
*  more than any other state in human history. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1085.84s)]
*  I know exactly what happened in Iraq, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1090.96s)]
*  in Afghanistan and in Kosovo. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1093.68s)]
*  Those were war crimes as well. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1095.6s)]
*  To do everything in order to hit [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1097.76s)]
*  only military targets. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1100.0s)]
*  But this is exactly the case. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1101.36s)]
*  Amir Ailon, we have seen with our own eyes [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1102.8s)]
*  on camera people holding white flags. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1105.28s)]
*  Amir Ailon, sorry. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1108.56s)]
*  We have seen with our own eyes [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1109.52s)]
*  old ladies holding white flags, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1111.44s)]
*  men groups holding white, being gunned down. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1113.6s)]
*  I've seen it with my own eyes, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1115.4399999999998s)]
*  my own lying eyes. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1116.48s)]
*  That is not Hamas. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1118.0s)]
*  Those are innocent people [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1119.4399999999998s)]
*  being killed by Israeli snipers. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1120.32s)]
*  Look, it's a huge mistake [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1122.56s)]
*  to see as a picture [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1125.52s)]
*  or what is exactly happening in a moment, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1129.6s)]
*  without knowing anything [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1132.8s)]
*  about what is underground, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1134.8s)]
*  what happened a moment earlier, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1136.48s)]
*  and what will happen a moment later. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1138.08s)]
*  So I can try to explain it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1140.32s)]
*  I wrote about it in many articles. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1143.36s)]
*  But I'm telling you, and I know it by the way, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1145.36s)]
*  that we as a military organization [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1148.8s)]
*  are doing everything in order to hit [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1151.52s)]
*  only military targets. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1154.4799999999998s)]
*  So when Hamas is using his civilian installations, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  schools, mosques, and public places [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1163.4399999999998s)]
*  in order to build under or above the ground. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1168.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1172.64s)]
*  His military installations. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1173.14s)]
*  Understood. I know that's the argument. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1176.4s)]
*  This is allowed even by the international court. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1177.68s)]
*  Understood. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1183.8400000000001s)]
*  But nobody allows snipers gunning down [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  old ladies with white flags [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1186.3200000000002s)]
*  where there's no Hamas. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1187.3600000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1188.4s)]
*  It's not just clips that we've seen of snipers. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1189.2s)]
*  By the way, in cases in which we see it, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1191.6000000000001s)]
*  at least in our case, there is an investigation. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1197.2800000000002s)]
*  If you ask me, I cannot tell you the results. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1200.72s)]
*  Yeah, because you know and I know. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1203.5200000000002s)]
*  I would ask our army. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1205.68s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1208.48s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1208.72s)]
*  But this is not the case. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1209.2800000000002s)]
*  You know and I know that the Israeli soldiers [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1210.4s)]
*  are rarely ever prosecuted for war crimes. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1212.0800000000002s)]
*  And let me just point this out to you. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1213.76s)]
*  We've just made a documentary, Amir Aal. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1214.88s)]
*  I want to play you a clip. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1216.48s)]
*  Zatea has just made a documentary [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1217.8400000000001s)]

*  stealing Palestinian children's toys. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1233.28s)]
*  We've seen it all over social media. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1235.04s)]
*  The Israeli military has not stopped its soldiers [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1236.32s)]
*  from posting these videos. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1238.4799999999998s)]
*  Have a listen to what one soldier tells us [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1240.32s)]
*  in our documentary. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1242.4799999999998s)]
*  Let's play the clip. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1243.28s)]
*  What does that tell you about the state of Israel's military? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1259.1999999999998s)]
*  Is that kind of stuff tolerable? [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1265.1999999999998s)]
*  That soldiers are not just filming war crimes [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1266.8s)]
*  but then saying, you know what, we're superior to them. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1269.1999999999998s)]
*  We're better than them. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  In one clip another soldier says, you know what, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1272.8799999999999s)]
*  it's not wrong to torture terrorists. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  Have you seen the Israeli military [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1277.52s)]
*  so-called morale discipline just break down in Gaza? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1279.1999999999998s)]
*  What is going on here? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1281.84s)]
*  Soldiers feel that the enemy is a brutal, violent target [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1289.12s)]
*  that he has to kill. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1296.32s)]
*  And if you ask me, if you want to understand the Israeli war [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  when you listen to the soldier, you are doing a huge mistake. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1302.56s)]
*  You could do it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  You could listen to it. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1307.84s)]
*  But why aren't they stopping these videos? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1309.36s)]
*  Doing all the history. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1311.28s)]
*  But you were an admiral. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1312.56s)]
*  I was listening. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1313.4399999999998s)]
*  You were an admiral. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1314.32s)]
*  Would you have allowed your troops to wear lingerie? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1315.1999999999998s)]
*  You were an admiral. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1318.24s)]
*  Would you have allowed your troops to wear women's underwear [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1319.04s)]
*  and steal children's toys and make laughing videos? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1321.68s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1324.32s)]
*  That's what we're seeing. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1324.72s)]
*  I wouldn't. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1325.52s)]
*  And what I'm telling you that I hope, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1326.0s)]
*  I don't know every detail, but I hope that our military commander, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1329.04s)]
*  you don't listen to our military commanders. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1332.88s)]
*  They do not accept it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1336.08s)]
*  They instruct investigation in every case. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1338.16s)]
*  And during the war, war takes all of us to hell. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1342.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1347.36s)]
*  I'm glad you said that. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1348.16s)]
*  This is why it is so urgent to end this war. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1349.6000000000001s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1352.48s)]
*  We can agree on that. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1352.96s)]
*  And we can agree about hell. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1353.8400000000001s)]
*  Because last week, far-right protest in Israel [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1355.52s)]
*  made major headlines. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1357.6000000000001s)]
*  They stormed, as you know, Israeli military facilities [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1358.5600000000002s)]
*  called for the release of nine soldiers accused of gang raping [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1361.28s)]
*  a Palestinian prisoner to the point of paralysis. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1364.64s)]
*  Torturing and raping prisoners is a war crime. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1367.2s)]
*  Is it not, Amir Ayalon? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1370.16s)]
*  It is a war crime. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  And the five of them were not released. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1373.28s)]
*  They are still in jail. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1375.76s)]
*  And if you ask me, I have no idea what will happen. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1377.84s)]
*  If they did it, they will be tried. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1381.2s)]
*  This is exactly the Israeli code of ethics. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1385.6s)]
*  You say code of ethics. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1389.36s)]
*  Isn't the problem, Amir Ayalon, that this is far from the first [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1390.64s)]
*  time that Israel's been accused of torture? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1393.04s)]
*  Shin Bet, Israel's security service, which you were head of, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1395.04s)]
*  has been known for using extreme methods of torture [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1398.08s)]
*  on Palestinian prisoners for decades. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1400.24s)]
*  In fact, in 1999, when you were in prison, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1402.0s)]
*  when you were in charge, the complaints got so bad [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1405.2s)]
*  that Israel's Supreme Court had to intervene [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1407.8400000000001s)]
*  and say that Shin Bet's interrogation tactics, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1410.32s)]
*  like violent shakings, forcing Palestinians to crouch [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1412.88s)]
*  like frogs, shackling them in contorted positions [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  with sacks over their heads, was unlawful. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1418.56s)]
*  That happened on your watch. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1421.68s)]
*  Do you have any regrets for the torture [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1423.52s)]
*  that was carried out by Shin Bet when you were in charge? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1425.04s)]
*  Yes, first of all, I remember exactly [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1428.32s)]
*  the ruling of the Supreme Court. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1432.16s)]
*  They mentioned many, many cases during the last 20 years [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1434.56s)]
*  or 20 years before. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1438.48s)]
*  During my time, there was no case in which [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1441.1999999999998s)]
*  an interrogator, a prisoner, found himself in hospital. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1446.8s)]
*  And what the Supreme Court told us, in a way, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1452.9599999999998s)]
*  and you have to read exactly what they wrote, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1455.4399999999998s)]
*  in a way, they are telling us, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1458.6399999999999s)]
*  you should not do what you did, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1460.8s)]
*  and they took the right decision. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1463.84s)]
*  On the other hand, they told us, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1465.84s)]
*  and you have to read what they wrote. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1469.4399999999998s)]
*  If you see that there is a terrorist on his way [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1471.6s)]
*  to kill Israelis, you should do whatever is necessary. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1476.96s)]
*  The ticking time bomb. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1480.8s)]
*  And then you will be tried and the court will decide. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1481.76s)]
*  But Ali Ayalon, you know that many Palestinian [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1485.36s)]
*  detainees who are not ticking time bombs [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1489.76s)]
*  were tortured by Shin Bet. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1492.16s)]
*  You know that. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1493.68s)]
*  It means that the legal system does not have the tools [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1494.24s)]
*  to discuss terror because it was shaped during the time [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1498.32s)]
*  when states fought each other. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1502.4s)]
*  You have no regrets for any interrogations, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1504.4s)]
*  abuse, torture on your watch when you were head of Shin Bet? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1507.28s)]
*  Look, it's a great question. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1511.2s)]
*  I have many regrets. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1516.24s)]
*  Almost every evening. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1517.28s)]
*  But my regrets are on both sides. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1519.2s)]
*  I know that we did mistakes when I was the director [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1522.56s)]
*  of the Shin Bet. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1526.08s)]
*  No one, no one died as a result of these mistakes, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1527.2s)]
*  and no one was sent to hospital. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1532.0s)]
*  Okay, that's a low bar. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1533.68s)]
*  But people suffer. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1536.8s)]
*  On the other hand, I have regrets on several cases [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1539.04s)]
*  that I know that we didn't use all what we should [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1545.52s)]
*  and Israelis died. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1549.76s)]
*  So I have to live feeling that yes, on one hand, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1551.6799999999998s)]
*  I use violence when in retrospect I understand [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1558.32s)]
*  that it wasn't necessary. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1561.6s)]
*  On the other hand, we lost lives when we thought [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1563.12s)]
*  that we shouldn't do it. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1567.36s)]
*  And yes, Israelis died. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1569.44s)]
*  This is the way I have to live. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1572.48s)]
*  Last question, Amir Alon, and I appreciate you [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1575.12s)]
*  doing this interview. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  Let's look forward. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1577.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris could be the next president [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1578.96s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1580.56s)]
*  There's a lot of protests against us still over [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1581.84s)]
*  America's unconditional armed support for Israel. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1583.9199999999998s)]
*  If you were advising Kamala Harris, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1586.6399999999999s)]
*  what would you be telling her to do to end this war, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1588.24s)]
*  to get peace in the region, to get Palestinian freedom, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1591.84s)]
*  which you say you support? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1594.96s)]
*  To present every day a better political horizon [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1597.44s)]
*  for Israelis and for Palestinians. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1601.28s)]
*  And on the condition Israelis should know [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1604.0s)]
*  that this political future horizon will create [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc7eR8BIrHU&t=1607.76s)]
