Video Description: “When you see segregation. I don't need more time to understand what it is.”

Award-winning author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates joins ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’ to discuss his latest book’s focus on Palestine, and the reception it has received from the mainstream media – including a shocking interview on CBS.

In this exclusive interview, Coates discusses topics for the first time since the start of his book tour – including his view of President Biden’s Zionism, and his advice to Vice President Kamala Harris on arms sales to Israel.

His new book, The Message, explores how mainstream narratives shape and sometimes distort our experience. To write the book, Coates traveled to Senegal, South Carolina, and the occupied West Bank.

# Ta-Nehisi Coates on Israel’s APARTHEID: “We need more Palestinians telling the story”
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g)
*  Award-winning author and journalist, Tanahasi Coates, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=0.0s)]
*  has never been afraid to do some myth-busting, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=2.7s)]
*  even if it means going against the mainstream media [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=4.9s)]
*  or conventional wisdom. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=7.2s)]
*  In fact, that's exactly what he does in his new book, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  The Message, which explores how those mainstream narratives, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=11.08s)]
*  whether factual or fictional, shape and sometimes distort [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  not only our experiences, but also, quote, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=18.12s)]
*  who we believe is human and who we don't believe is human. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=20.82s)]
*  Coates starts off by taking us to Africa, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=24.46s)]
*  where he visits Dakar, Senegal. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=26.46s)]
*  He then brings us to Columbia, South Carolina, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=28.52s)]
*  where he confronts the banning of one of his own earlier books [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=30.62s)]
*  and reflects on America's failure [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=33.72s)]
*  to reckon with its Confederate history. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=35.6s)]
*  Finally, and perhaps most controversially, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=38.260000000000005s)]
*  Coates journeys to Palestine, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=40.74s)]
*  where he draws the perhaps undeniable connection [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=42.5s)]
*  between the occupation of the West Bank [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=45.24s)]
*  and the horrors of the Jim Crow South here in the U.S. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=47.28s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss all of this and more [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=50.28s)]
*  is none other than the award-winning author himself, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=52.28s)]
*  Ta-Nehisi Coates, who is with Vanity Fair. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=54.28s)]
*  He's at Howard University, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=57.94s)]
*  but he's got this big new book out, The Message. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=59.620000000000005s)]
*  Thank you so much for coming on, Mehdi Anfalta. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=61.88s)]
*  Congratulations on the new book. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=63.88s)]
*  Mehdi, thank you for having me. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=65.28s)]
*  The New York Times, Ta-Nehisi, once described you [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=66.78s)]
*  as one of the most influential black intellectuals [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=68.78s)]
*  of our generation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  The question is, what is the most important thing [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  that you've ever done to a person? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=75.26s)]
*  I'm gonna read this one, Ta-Nehisi. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=77.42s)]
*  It's a question that's been asked [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=79.12s)]
*  by a lot of people all over the world [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=80.72s)]
*  of our generation. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=82.72s)]
*  The question is, this is your first nonfiction book [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=84.22s)]
*  for seven years. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=86.76s)]
*  Where you been? We missed you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=88.22s)]
*  Yeah, can you tell how comfortable I am [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=89.80000000000001s)]
*  with that description? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=92.7s)]
*  That's probably part of why I was gone for seven years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=94.06s)]
*  You know, I don't know, I think people call you one thing, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  but you always have to remember what you are [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=100.34s)]
*  and what your interests are, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=103.48s)]
*  and I'm just as proud and proud as I am [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=105.0s)]
*  and as honored as I am to really define [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  what your journey is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm a writer, so I've been pursuing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  my various writing interests. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  That's basically been it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=114.04s)]
*  You were doing Black Panther. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  I was. I did Captain America for a little while. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=116.48s)]
*  But during that period, we had 2020, George Floyd. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=119.12s)]
*  We did. We did. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=122.02000000000001s)]
*  Insurrection. We did. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=123.02000000000001s)]
*  You must have been tempted to go. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=124.02000000000001s)]
*  I was, and that's always like the conflict, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  Like, it's like the politics are calling you back, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=127.12s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=129.12s)]
*  And so do you, you know what I mean? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=130.12s)]
*  Divert, you know, what your natural inclinations are [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=132.12s)]
*  and what your politics do, but if you do that, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  like, it's kind of how every four years, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=136.98000000000002s)]
*  it's the most important election of our lifetime. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  Like, every four years, there's one of those. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  Yes, and so you'll just be doing this the rest of your life, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=144.98000000000002s)]
*  you know, and I just, I don't... [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=147.46s)]
*  I feel seen. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=149.46s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=150.96s)]
*  So it is the most important election of our lifetime. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=152.96s)]
*  We've also got a genocide in Gaza to join in 2024. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=154.96s)]
*  This is the year of the election and the genocide. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=158.96s)]
*  How does Ta-Nehisi Coates, who is best known [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=161.96s)]
*  for his book about reparations and slavery [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=163.96s)]
*  and our historic legacy, the Black experience, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=165.96s)]
*  how do you end up writing a book in this year, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=168.96s)]
*  2024, the year of our Lord, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=171.96s)]
*  about Palestine, the Palestinian experience? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=173.96s)]
*  How do you end up in Hebron? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=176.96s)]
*  I wish I could tell you it was planned, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=178.96s)]
*  and this was the intention. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=180.96s)]
*  It was not, you know. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=182.96s)]
*  A case for reparations came out in 2014. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=184.96s)]
*  There was some amount of due [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=186.96s)]
*  and I would say credible critique, you know, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=188.96s)]
*  of that article and how it used reparations [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=190.96s)]
*  to the Israeli state from West Germany [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=192.96s)]
*  as a kind of prototype and what that meant [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=194.96s)]
*  and the meaning of that, and I thought, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=197.96s)]
*  like, the most trenching critique of that was [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=199.96s)]
*  if reparations is more than just a cash payment, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=201.96s)]
*  if it actually is, you know, something larger, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=204.96s)]
*  then you have to look at what the larger project inspired. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=206.96s)]
*  And so I always knew that I would go back [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=209.96s)]
*  and write about that, but to do it right and correct, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=212.96s)]
*  I had to get there, and it just turned out [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=215.96s)]
*  that summer of 2023 was when I finally was able [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=217.96s)]
*  to actually get there and spend some time [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=219.96s)]
*  and, you know, half of the message comes out of that trip. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=221.96s)]
*  Yes, because you go to Senegal, you go to South Carolina, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=224.96s)]
*  you go to Palestine. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=227.96s)]
*  Were you ready for the backlash [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=229.96s)]
*  that was going to come your way, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=231.96s)]
*  the predictable accusations of anti-Semitism from some, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=233.96s)]
*  when you told your editors, your publisher, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=236.96s)]
*  that you were going to take on this thorniest [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=238.96s)]
*  of thorny issues, this third rail of American politics? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=240.96s)]
*  Yeah, I was, I was, but more important, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=242.96s)]
*  my editor, Chris Jackson, in One World Books, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=244.96s)]
*  they were ready, and they understood it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=247.96s)]
*  They really, I died, you know, I would, you know, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=249.96s)]
*  I know there are a lot of stories out there [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=252.96s)]
*  about people being censored, pushed back, et cetera. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=254.96s)]
*  I have not, in the writing and publication of this book, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  experienced that. We knew, we knew what we were doing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=259.96000000000004s)]
*  And I think, like, that's a message that is about something [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  larger than just us, you know what I mean, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  and myself at One World. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  There are people who are trying to apply [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  and trying to figure out how can they get through [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  whenever you have these kind of, you know, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  moments where something is, you know, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  forbidden to talk about. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=277.96s)]
*  And at least thus far, you know, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=279.96s)]
*  I know the attacks are not done, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=281.96s)]
*  I know there will be more, you know, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=283.96s)]
*  but to actually get the book out into the world, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=285.96s)]
*  the hardest thing was actually writing it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=287.96s)]
*  and getting it done. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=289.96s)]
*  That was the hardest part, actually. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=291.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure for you, for those of us watching, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=293.96s)]
*  the hardest part now is seeing your message [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=295.96s)]
*  get through, doing this media tour, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=297.96s)]
*  seeing someone like yourself address these issues [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=299.96s)]
*  that others have tried to and failed to in the past. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=301.96s)]
*  One of the moments that sticks out for me in the book [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=303.96s)]
*  is when you drove past cisterns on Palestinian roofs, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=305.96s)]
*  which are illegal, and you drew a connection [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=309.96s)]
*  between the occupation of Palestine [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=311.96s)]
*  and the Jim Crow South, and you pointed out how [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=313.96s)]
*  in the Jim Crow South, there were segregated [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=315.96s)]
*  water fountains and swimming pools, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=317.96s)]
*  but in Palestine, Israel has managed to segregate [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=319.96s)]
*  the water supply itself. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=321.96s)]
*  Water itself is segregated. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=323.96s)]
*  So when you see that, I just want to understand, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=325.96s)]
*  what's going through your head at the moment [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=327.96s)]
*  and what connections are you drawing as you're seeing that in real time? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=329.96s)]
*  So not to get too in the weeds, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=331.96s)]
*  this is one of the things that I actually had to... [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=333.96s)]
*  When you talk about the difficulty of writing a book, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=335.96s)]
*  it was told to me that in fact the things on the roof [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=337.96s)]
*  are not cisterns. Those are actually [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=339.96s)]
*  water containers that they use to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=341.96s)]
*  hold the water that is piped in, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=343.96s)]
*  but they have no predictable [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=345.96s)]
*  way of knowing how much, and I'm talking about [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=347.96s)]
*  God, I don't want to get too far into the weeds, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=349.96s)]
*  but they have no predictable way of knowing [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=351.96s)]
*  how much water is going to be piped in when. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=353.96s)]
*  And then there are cisterns in some areas [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=355.96s)]
*  that are on the ground, which are used to collect rainwater. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=357.96s)]
*  The cisterns on the ground are actually illegal. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=359.96s)]
*  Israel controls the water in the clouds, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=361.96s)]
*  as well as the groundwater. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=363.96s)]
*  And so seeing that and understanding that, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=365.96s)]
*  I think the thing that shocked me the most, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=367.96s)]
*  Nettie, is, and maybe I just missed it, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=369.96s)]
*  but I consider myself a relatively [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=371.96s)]
*  intelligent reader of news, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=373.96s)]
*  and I felt like I've never seen that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=375.96s)]
*  in a mainstream publication. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=377.96s)]
*  It's never been pointed out in experience. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=379.96s)]
*  Like, why is that not? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=381.96s)]
*  And it's so obviously Jim Crow. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=383.96s)]
*  It's so obviously segregation. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=385.96s)]
*  It's also more so the fact that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=387.96s)]
*  it's so obviously segregation. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=389.96s)]
*  It's also more than that, as I explore in the essay. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=391.96s)]
*  You say the A word. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=393.96s)]
*  Apartheid. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=395.96s)]
*  It's a word that some people say, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=397.96s)]
*  they try to include it in definitions of anti-Semitism. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=399.96s)]
*  Do you accuse Israel of apartheid? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=401.96s)]
*  Makes your anti-Semitic, some say. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=403.96s)]
*  Yeah, I really don't know what to say. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=405.96s)]
*  As I've said, how many? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=407.96s)]
*  We've got Amnesty International, we have Betsalem, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=409.96s)]
*  we have Human Rights Watch, we have Al Haq. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=411.96s)]
*  I mean, we have numerous human rights groups [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=413.96s)]
*  who have looked at this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=415.96s)]
*  And this is, as you know, of Israel itself. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=417.96s)]
*  Barak, Olmert. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=419.96s)]
*  Jimmy Carter. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=421.96s)]
*  100 year old Jimmy Carter. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=423.96s)]
*  Yes, and so it's kind of a game, you know what I mean, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=425.96s)]
*  that we're playing, acting like this is somehow forbid. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=427.96s)]
*  And it relies on the ignorance of other people. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=429.96s)]
*  And just to be clear, because you've talked very honestly [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=431.96s)]
*  about your journey, about the reparations case in Israel, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=433.96s)]
*  about how when you were at the Atlantic [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=435.96s)]
*  writing about politics, you were kind of aware of this stuff, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=437.96s)]
*  but not fully. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=439.96s)]
*  So if somebody had come to Ta-Nehisi Coates in 2016 [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=441.96s)]
*  and said Israel is an apartheid state, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=443.96s)]
*  which is a phrase you used recently, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=445.96s)]
*  what would you have said to them? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=447.96s)]
*  I would say, it might be. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=449.96s)]
*  Like, that's what I would have said. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=451.96s)]
*  I'm uncomfortable saying that publicly, but I'm not sure you're wrong. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=453.96s)]
*  It would have been like that. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=455.96s)]
*  It might be, but I don't, you know. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=457.96s)]
*  So you talk in the book about one of your Palestinian guides [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=459.96s)]
*  in the West Bank, Olmert, who presented a threat, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=461.96s)]
*  you say, to the Israelis watching him, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=463.96s)]
*  because he presented, quote, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=465.96s)]
*  the threat of the storyteller who can, through words, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=467.96s)]
*  erode the claims of the powerful. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=469.96s)]
*  Is that what you're trying to do with this book? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=471.96s)]
*  What I'm trying to do with this book is get out of the way. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=473.96s)]
*  I'm trying to clear space, hopefully, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=475.96s)]
*  for Palestinian narrators and storytellers, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=477.96s)]
*  and in a larger sense, you know, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=479.96s)]
*  for Arab storytellers at large, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=481.96s)]
*  you know, because we know how Islamophobia works, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=483.96s)]
*  to be able to tell the story themselves. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=485.96s)]
*  I don't want to be here a year from now. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=487.96s)]
*  You know, and it's not because I'm scared to talk about it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=489.96s)]
*  It's not because, you know, I don't want to talk about it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=491.96s)]
*  It's not because I don't feel it. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=493.96s)]
*  But the agents of the story, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=495.96s)]
*  the people who are the people who are the people [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=497.96s)]
*  who are the people who are the people who are the people [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=499.96s)]
*  who are the people who are the people who are the people who are [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=501.96s)]
*  there, you know... [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=503.96s)]
*  The agents of the story should tell the story. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=505.96s)]
*  The people who are under the system of apartheid [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=507.96s)]
*  should be the ones narrating it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=509.96s)]
*  So my goal really is to, you know, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=511.96s)]
*  just open the space and let people know that there is a big, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=513.96s)]
*  big place in this narrative that we're missing. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=515.96s)]
*  I'll ask you a question on that that might make you uncomfortable [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=517.96s)]
*  given how you reacted to the black intellectual line. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=519.96s)]
*  The reality is I move around in a lot of these circles [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=521.96s)]
*  and people are saying, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=523.96s)]
*  yes, wow, when you came out after October 7th at that event in New York [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=525.96s)]
*  and spoke on stage, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=527.96s)]
*  It's like, wow, Tahnawasi's with us. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=529.96s)]
*  You understand the impact, surely, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=532.4000000000001s)]
*  of someone like yourself clearing this space, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=534.84s)]
*  I try not to think about it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=539.48s)]
*  But it's important to a lot of other people. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  I'll let them say that. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=544.08s)]
*  It's important that I not think about it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=545.52s)]
*  Because it's very... You can start sniffing... [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm just wondering whether it's a conscious... [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you understand that you are... [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=549.9200000000001s)]
*  You do have access to the platforms [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  that those Palestinian rights don't do... [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=553.6s)]
*  I do. I agree. That's a fact. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  And you're using it well right now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  I can say that. You can't. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  You are using it well. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=559.48s)]
*  No, no. It's a fact that I have that access. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=560.5200000000001s)]
*  So, for example, you're writing in Vanity Fair [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=561.8800000000001s)]
*  about the Democratic National Convention, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=563.72s)]
*  of all places, Vanity Fair. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=565.08s)]
*  And you refer to the war in Gaza, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=566.36s)]
*  I think for the first time, as a genocide. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=568.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=569.84s)]
*  What was that moment of realization [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=570.8800000000001s)]
*  that it's time to use the G word, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=573.12s)]
*  another word that people run away from [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=574.5200000000001s)]
*  in the American media? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=575.8800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it was pretty easy for me. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=577.44s)]
*  You know, I read a lot of the research on genocide. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=580.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, I looked at the South African case. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=582.8800000000001s)]
*  And actually, the minute we had the hyperlink, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=585.24s)]
*  and I'm sorry you had me on the spot, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=587.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna forget the guy's name. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=588.4s)]
*  But there was a guy who, I believe, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=590.04s)]
*  used to direct human rights... [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=592.64s)]
*  Ariya Nair. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=594.88s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=595.92s)]
*  You know, I had written this article [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=597.44s)]
*  in a New York Review. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=599.48s)]
*  And so the minute, you know, I link... [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=600.52s)]
*  And he said, I don't use the G word myself very often, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=602.0s)]
*  but I got to using it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=604.16s)]
*  And if you look at that, it's hyperlinked in that. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=605.52s)]
*  So it's like, okay, you wanna fight with me? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=608.12s)]
*  You wanna fight with him? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=609.48s)]
*  You wanna tell him it's not? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=610.64s)]
*  You know what I mean? And so at that point, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=611.8000000000001s)]
*  you know, I actually didn't get much pushback on that either. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=613.44s)]
*  But you know that within newsrooms, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=615.48s)]
*  there's a lot of pushback on using that word [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=616.68s)]
*  for journalists who are not Ta-Nehisi. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=618.4399999999999s)]
*  I do. I didn't slide it in. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=620.0s)]
*  Like, I had editors who supported me. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=622.1999999999999s)]
*  I just always had to make that clear. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=623.68s)]
*  It's my... Yeah, it's my byline there, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=625.12s)]
*  but I can't... I couldn't have done it without them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=627.12s)]
*  I'm glad you got it into Vanity Fair. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=630.0s)]
*  You write in the book about how journalists [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=631.56s)]
*  have been playing God on this issue. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=633.24s)]
*  Quote, it is the journalists who decide [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=634.84s)]
*  which sides are legitimate and which are not, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=636.4s)]
*  which views should be considered [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  and which pushed out of the frame. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=640.04s)]
*  And I was reading this on a plane, your book. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=641.48s)]
*  And he is shouting hallelujah out loud in the plane [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=643.76s)]
*  as you wrote that line, because it's something [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=645.8s)]
*  I've been bothered about for many years. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=647.4399999999999s)]
*  You have this much-needed brilliant critique [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=649.04s)]
*  of how the media screws up the coverage of Palestine, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=651.7199999999999s)]
*  dehumanizes Palestinians, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  marginalizes Palestinian perspectives, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=655.7199999999999s)]
*  how it elevates, and I'm quoting you, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=657.8s)]
*  factual complexity over self-evident morality. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=659.76s)]
*  Hear, hear. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=662.52s)]
*  And then you go on the CBS Morning Show, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=663.76s)]
*  and Tony DeCople, the host, basically vindicates [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=666.12s)]
*  everything you wrote in the book. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=669.52s)]
*  He engages in every lazy trope on the issue, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=670.92s)]
*  right to exist, et cetera. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=672.7199999999999s)]
*  He even suggests your book would not be out of place [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=674.1600000000001s)]
*  in the backpack of an extremist. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=679.2s)]
*  The content of that section would not be out of place [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=680.24s)]
*  in the backpack of an extremist. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  And I walk down a street in Hebron, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  and a guy says to me, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=687.4000000000001s)]
*  I can't walk down the street unless I profess my religion. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=688.84s)]
*  I'm with another... No, no, no, no, no. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=692.6800000000001s)]
*  This is very, very important. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  He can't ride on certain roads. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=696.2s)]
*  He can't get water in the same way [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=698.44s)]
*  that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=700.8000000000001s)]
*  from him can. Why is that okay? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=703.44s)]
*  Why is that? Why is there no agency in this book [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=705.2s)]
*  for the Palestinians? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  They exist in your narrative [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=709.6s)]
*  merely as victims of the Israelis. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=711.08s)]
*  What is their role in the lack of a... [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=713.1600000000001s)]
*  I have a very, very, very, very moral compass about this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=715.4000000000001s)]
*  And again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=719.48s)]
*  Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=722.12s)]
*  Again, it's very hard for me to analyze that, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=724.96s)]
*  because I was in it... [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  What were you thinking at that moment? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=728.08s)]
*  I was a little surprised, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=729.6800000000001s)]
*  and then I realized what was going on. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=731.96s)]
*  What was going on? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=734.4s)]
*  I was in a fight. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=736.52s)]
*  It took me a moment to realize I was in a fight. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=738.5600000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? But the good thing was [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=740.4s)]
*  that the answers to the questions [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=742.36s)]
*  were, like, right there at hand, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=744.88s)]
*  because I'd actually been thinking about them. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=746.2800000000001s)]
*  And I don't know if folks actually realize all the time. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=748.2s)]
*  Like, the awards can kind of fool people, actually, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=753.6800000000001s)]
*  and they think you're just the awards. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=756.1600000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like, they don't realize [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=758.36s)]
*  the amount of work that goes into... [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=759.76s)]
*  Like, if you're going to come out and say apartheid, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=761.72s)]
*  if you're going to say genocide, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=763.28s)]
*  that you actually really, really have considered it, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=764.52s)]
*  you know what I mean, for a long, long time [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=766.8000000000001s)]
*  and done the homework of it. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=768.36s)]
*  And so it was right there. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=770.44s)]
*  You know, it was a pop quiz. But I had studied, so... [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=771.72s)]
*  You also made a very simple point about, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=773.96s)]
*  just go there and see for yourself, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=775.76s)]
*  When you see what's happening in Hebron, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=777.48s)]
*  segregated streets, there's no other word but apartheid. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  Dropsite News, my old friends Ryan Grim and Jeremy Scahill [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=781.72s)]
*  have launched a petition to try and get CBS News [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=784.28s)]
*  to send Tony DeCoppo to Hebron with a camera crew. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=786.88s)]
*  To see apartheid for himself. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=789.64s)]
*  I'm just moving away from just Tony. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=791.08s)]
*  Do you think that's what's needed [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=792.88s)]
*  that more American reporters, pundits, politicians [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=794.48s)]
*  go and see what the occupation is like [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=797.92s)]
*  with their own two eyes? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=800.08s)]
*  I just think we need more Palestinians telling the story. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=801.56s)]
*  I just... I think that... [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=805.28s)]
*  And not just as correspondents, as editors, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=807.28s)]
*  like, I just think we need other people. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=809.24s)]
*  Yes, yes, definitely. We do. We do, we do. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=810.96s)]
*  But I've always wondered, like, what is, like... [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=813.4399999999999s)]
*  Like, when I was doing my... I was like, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=815.56s)]
*  how many reporters actually come here? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=816.84s)]
*  Do they not come here? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=818.24s)]
*  The congresspeople that come back and support Israel, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=819.28s)]
*  do they... have they walked through Hebron? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=821.44s)]
*  Three stage tours that they get from various groups. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=823.32s)]
*  So does that mean you don't... [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=825.76s)]
*  And I literally don't know this. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=826.92s)]
*  Does that mean you don't really go to the West Bank? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=828.16s)]
*  You just go to Ramallah and come back? Like, what... [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=830.12s)]
*  Look, you've heard the other criticism of you in this book [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=833.64s)]
*  that you only spent ten days in the West Bank [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=835.6s)]
*  and now suddenly you're an expert on this complicated issue. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=837.44s)]
*  That it's way more complex than you could ever know [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=840.0s)]
*  from a ten-day trip. What do you say to those people? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=842.24s)]
*  I'm sure it is way more complex. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=844.2s)]
*  I don't think those people would have agreed with me [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=845.92s)]

*  What did you read? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=934.8s)]
*  What kind of stuff did you do to get to this point? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=936.2s)]
*  I feel a lot of people at home are wondering, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=939.96s)]
*  what book did Ta-Nehisi read that got him, you know, really... [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=941.6s)]
*  It was a lot. It was a lot. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=944.36s)]
*  There's an essay on my website entitled No Torn to Catastrophe [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=945.8s)]
*  and it goes through a lot of what I read and what I talk to. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=949.92s)]
*  At the back of the book, there's a link to the essay [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=953.16s)]
*  and you can see it was extensive. It hurt. It was a lot. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=954.88s)]
*  Was there a particular person or voice or anyone that stood out? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=958.56s)]
*  Man, Noura Erakat. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=961.4s)]
*  OK. I'm literally going to see her tonight at an event. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=963.0s)]
*  She was tremendous. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=966.24s)]
*  Palestinian lawyer, academic, writer. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=968.6s)]
*  Her book, Justice for Some, is a tremendous book. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=971.2s)]
*  But Noura... I'm working on my Arabic pronunciations here. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=973.2s)]
*  Noura also read it for me, you know what I mean? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=977.2s)]
*  And gave me all of the critique and all of the, you know what I mean, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=980.04s)]
*  things I was missing and et cetera. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=982.96s)]
*  She was... I couldn't have done it without her. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=984.96s)]
*  Fantastic. I'm going to ask a question about the relationship [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=987.08s)]
*  between black and Jewish communities in the US right now. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=989.8s)]
*  We're in election year. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=991.84s)]
*  A lot of black writers like yourself, black academics, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=993.68s)]
*  black pastors in places like Georgia, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=995.84s)]
*  have come out in defence of Palestinians, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=997.56s)]
*  have come out against the genocide in Gaza. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=999.64s)]
*  And a lot of Jewish liberals, pro-Israel Jewish liberals, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1001.68s)]
*  maybe they don't self-identify in that way, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1005.0s)]
*  have said, and I've heard them say, some of them said to me, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1006.68s)]
*  we feel betrayed. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1008.36s)]
*  We marched in 2020 after George Floyd [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1009.6s)]
*  with our black brothers and sisters [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1012.52s)]
*  and now they've let us down on this issue. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1013.88s)]
*  They're not standing with us when we feel threatened. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1015.56s)]
*  Do you worry about the relationship between black and Jewish communities [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1017.88s)]
*  because of Palestine in this country? [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1020.12s)]
*  No, because I think anybody that seriously really, really feels [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1021.32s)]
*  that what happened in 2020 was a real thing, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1024.92s)]
*  an offence against human rights, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1028.04s)]
*  like they didn't do it to get credit. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1029.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, they didn't do it to... [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1032.24s)]
*  You know, a true coalition is not a quid pro quo. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1034.08s)]
*  Quote. It's based on principle. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1038.0s)]
*  You know, it's not... And I don't usually say things like this, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1040.2s)]
*  but it's not just based on, you know, like a kind of ethnic, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1042.92s)]
*  you know, you scratch my back. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1046.32s)]

*  Yes. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1053.2s)]

*  We know that Donald Trump doesn't give a shit about Palestinians. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1065.76s)]
*  He uses it as a pejorative, as an insult now. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1068.88s)]
*  What do you make of Joe Biden and especially Kamala Harris on this issue? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1071.68s)]
*  Do you think they give a damn about Palestinians? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1074.8400000000001s)]

*  You know, I'm not. You know what I mean? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1084.8s)]

*  You know? And so he's a true believer. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1133.64s)]
*  He clearly is, you know? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1136.12s)]

*  that it is principal also. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1176.12s)]
*  This is extremely, extremely important, [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1177.92s)]

*  If Donald Trump wins again, despite everything, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1199.6s)]
*  the racism, the fascism, the criminal convictions, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1202.08s)]
*  the insurrection, the impeachments, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1204.12s)]
*  what will that say about America in 2024, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uNkNcNjV8g&t=1205.72s)]
