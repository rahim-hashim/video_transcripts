# “Muslims Don’t Matter”: Former British Conservative Cabinet Minister On Living In Constant Fear
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ)
*  I think that the Conservative Party's relationship with the Muslim community is deeply toxic and flawed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Why? Is it because your party is a racist party? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=6.88s)]
*  I think my party has over time been ideologically taken over by people who are anti-Muslim. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=9.52s)]
*  I wasn't surprised when the far-right racist riots happened, when they attacked Muslims, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=19.2s)]
*  when Muslims were blamed for things they hadn't done, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=25.2s)]
*  when they were seen to be the ones that they wanted to blame, even if they weren't involved. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=28.08s)]
*  This has been a long time coming and it's what I have been warning about. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=32.56s)]
*  Do you believe the British government is complicit in war crimes in Gaza? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=36.0s)]
*  I think that war crimes have been committed in Gaza and I feel that we have not done enough to stop them. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=38.88s)]
*  Muslims don't matter. That's not just the ever-increasing feeling for many Muslims living [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=49.28s)]
*  in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom where Islamophobia has become the norm. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=53.92s)]
*  It's also the name of the new book from Baroness Saeeda Varsi who served as Britain's first Muslim [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  cabinet minister under the Conservative-led coalition government of David Cameron, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=63.92s)]
*  resigning over Gaza in 2014 and more recently resigning the Conservative whip itself, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=68.0s)]
*  saying her party has moved too far to the Islamophobic right. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=73.28s)]
*  Muslims don't matter examines the realities of being Muslim in the UK where many, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=77.44s)]
*  especially in the wake of the recent race riots, are unsure whether Britain is still a safe place [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=81.6s)]
*  to call home and are actively putting together a plan B in case they have to leave the country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=86.24s)]
*  Varsi says that she will stay in the UK and fight for her quote rightful place in it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=92.08s)]
*  Ultimately Varsi's book is a call to turn off the tap of hatred and ensure the country that [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=97.44s)]
*  her grandfather fought for and her child continues to protect will be one that future generations of [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=102.08s)]
*  Muslims feel at home in. I recently sat down with Baroness Varsi in London for a wide-ranging [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=108.0s)]
*  conversation about her new book Islamophobia in the UK and the US, the state of Britain's [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=113.76s)]
*  Conservative party and of course the genocide in Gaza. Baroness Varsi thank you so much for [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=119.12s)]
*  doing this interview with Zatea. Thank you for having me. Congratulations on the book. Thank you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=124.48s)]
*  It is called, we're going to put it up there for all of you, it's called Muslims Don't Matter so [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=128.64s)]
*  the obvious first question, why don't Muslims matter? I think for me this book was a moment when [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=132.16s)]
*  in the middle of the conflict in Gaza and I looked at the way in which policymakers were responding [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=139.6s)]
*  to the British public response to what was happening in Gaza that actually even if people [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  were not Muslim but they were perceived to be Muslim they were dehumanized. That the dehumanizing [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  of Muslims had got to that stage that you didn't even have to be Muslim anymore to not matter but [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=158.56s)]
*  if you were perceived to be Muslim you too didn't matter. So I think it was for me something about [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=164.4s)]
*  being plus 50, something about getting to the point where I genuinely feel like I'm done, I'm [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=171.12s)]
*  done with trying to explain to people and to justify and to reason and to evidence and to do [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=178.16s)]
*  all those things that I have done for over three decades now in my political life where- [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=186.88s)]
*  Condemn, disown, dissociate? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  Caveat. All the things that were expected to do and I just said look I'm done. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  So this book is your F you? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=200.72s)]
*  It is but it's also I suppose a really, it's me journaling my hurt if that's the way young people [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=203.12s)]
*  see it. It's me waking up and realizing that the country that my grandfathers fought for, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=211.04s)]
*  the country that my child still in uniform fights for and protects is failing to protect me. That [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=217.76s)]
*  in this country for generations on we don't matter, we don't belong, that we're still othered [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=224.56s)]
*  and that it doesn't matter how much blood, sweat, life we give we are still seen as the enemy [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  within that even as somebody like me who is at the heart of the establishment, the enemy within [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=239.68s)]
*  was the title of my earlier book but even somebody like me who at the heart of the establishment as [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  a privy counsellor, as a member of the House of Lords still feels like I need to start looking [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=249.84s)]
*  over my shoulder and when I speak to my very successful middle-class Muslim friends and family [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  who are planning exit routes and plan Bs and wondering where else they could stay, that sense [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=261.52s)]
*  of fear that this place may not be a safe place, a welcoming place for my grandchildren. So was it [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=266.88s)]
*  a big F you? I think it's a combination of fear and heartbreak and wanting to sound the sirens and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=274.8s)]
*  say to people we've really got to change course. Well you definitely sound the siren in the book, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=280.64s)]
*  you start the book by talking about the plan B, Muslim families talking about plan B which is [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=284.96s)]
*  interesting because obviously I'm a British Muslim now American Muslim as well and based in the US [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=290.32s)]
*  where a lot of Muslims counting down the days to a possible second Trump presidency are having [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=295.36s)]
*  similar conversations about if it's going to be really bad what do we do. It's funny because I [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=300.0s)]
*  spoke to two British Asian public figures recently on my podcast one was Riz Ahmed who we both know [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=304.48s)]
*  the other is Nish Kumar and with both of them the topic comes up about how we feel under siege, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=310.0s)]
*  how we're treated. Riz and I kind of had a joke about what are our plan Bs, what are the cities [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=316.56s)]
*  we would go to if we had to flee but I'm surprised to hear you say that the UK is at that similar [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=321.12s)]
*  stage of the US because when I look at the UK I think okay Boris Johnson was awful you know Rishi [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=327.76s)]
*  Sunak, Liz Truss, the Conservative government that just got deposed was awful but they did get defeated [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=332.24s)]
*  they are gone your party I should point out although not people I know you share views with on this stuff [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=337.12s)]
*  but you suggest in the book that actually British Muslims are going through a very similar experience [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=343.44s)]
*  as Muslim Americans. Yeah and that's both based upon my own personal experience but also sitting [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=348.16s)]
*  at the heart of policy making. If I go back to some of the conversations that we were having [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=353.04s)]
*  in 2007, 8, 9 and I thought they were worrying conversations they're not a patch on where we are [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=358.72s)]
*  now if you think about the kind of organizations like the Henry Jackson society, the Centre for [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  Social Cohesion, individuals like Douglas Murray who were considered to be completely beyond the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=370.40000000000003s)]
*  pale and under a Cameron government. Now they're all mainstream. Exactly under a Cameron government [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=374.88s)]
*  he was specifically not engaged with and yet the Home Secretary, the ex-Home Secretary Suhela [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  Bravmann stood at the dispatch box in the House of Commons and said he has mainstream views so that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=386.4s)]
*  shifting of the extreme opinion to be now considered to be mainstream in politics is deeply [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=391.84s)]
*  disturbing and from a personal perspective Maddie you know I'm one of five and three of them have [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=397.36s)]
*  already bought a place somewhere else. You're talking about siblings? And siblings and I'm [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=402.48s)]
*  resisting I'm saying I'm not prepared to do that I'm going to fight for my rightful place in my [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=408.16s)]
*  country and so I think for me it is worrying that you know the interestingly there's a new report [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  out by a think tank called Equi which basically says that it's actually the more socially mobile, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=420.48s)]
*  the more financially successful part of the Muslim community which is planning the exit rules. Those [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=426.24s)]
*  people that can. That can. But elsewhere. You touched on a lot there and there's a lot I want [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=431.76s)]
*  to just explore with you. Just in order though let's just start at the top because you mentioned [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=436.0s)]
*  people being perceived as Muslim which reminds me of the debate over Islamophobia which has been [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=441.12s)]
*  going on for a long time and I'm talking about the definition this idea that well it doesn't exist [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=446.0s)]
*  right there was an argument for a long time it's a made-up word as if every word isn't a made-up word [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=450.4s)]
*  uh it can't be a phobia because that's a medical condition as if we don't talk about homophobia. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=454.88s)]
*  It can't be racism. This is the classic that I've dealt with for 20 years I'm sure you've dealt with [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=459.03999999999996s)]
*  the same thing. You were part of the group that pushed and is still pushing a definition of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=462.64s)]
*  Islamophobia. You talk about it in the book. I want to read it out. Islamophobia is rooted in racism [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=469.2s)]
*  and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslim-ness or perceived Muslim-ness. It is [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=474.47999999999996s)]
*  a form of anti-Muslim racism. Now the Richard Dawkins of this world who I've interviewed, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=480.96s)]
*  the Sam Harris of this world who I've clashed with and all the people you've clashed with [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=485.52s)]
*  would say don't be silly Islamophobia is not racism because Islam is not a race. What is [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=488.96s)]
*  your response to that when you talk about this definition? Well the complete nonsense that [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=494.32s)]
*  somehow racism and racialization of a community is to do with the pigment in your skin just doesn't [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  hold true. Look at any social studies academic work over the last five decades and they will show you [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=504.96s)]
*  that actually the racialization, the stereotyping, the stigmatizing of a community [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=511.76s)]
*  has got nothing to do with the color of your skin because if it was anti-Semitism a form of anti-Jewish [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=516.0s)]
*  racism would not be Jewish racism because Jews come in as many colors as Muslims do. You have [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=522.64s)]
*  brown Jews and black Jews and Arab Jews and white Jews so just because Muslims come in every color [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=527.84s)]
*  that there is across the world should not prevent them from being a racialized group and what for me [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  is really fascinating is that two attacks one happened outside parliament where a Sikh man [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=539.6s)]
*  was attacked and called a Muslim and a second a dentist was attacked viciously attacked in Wales [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=545.12s)]
*  as a revenge attack for the killing of Dromali Rigby and again he was attacked because he was [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=552.72s)]
*  perceived to be Muslim. So this is the racialization you don't have to be Muslim you don't have to be [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=557.84s)]
*  brown you don't have to be black to be subjected to an Islamophobic attack it is the racialization [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=564.56s)]
*  of a community and if we are still I mean remember this notion of anti-Muslim racism was first [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=570.64s)]
*  introduced in the 90s by the Runnymede Trust this is not a new concept but the fact that here we are [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=576.3199999999999s)]
*  in 2024 arguing about a word. Having gone through Labour government, Conservative government now another Labour government and still [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=582.0s)]
*  arguing about the word. We're instead of getting behind the fight against it. You for those of our [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=588.4799999999999s)]
*  viewers listeners watching around the world were the most senior Muslim in government in 2011 13 [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=595.28s)]
*  years ago when you gave a very famous speech talking about how Islamophobia has passed the [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=602.56s)]
*  dinner table test. Just lay out for people who are not aware of that what what were you referring to? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=607.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean first of all 2011 was very early in my political career in government and you know I [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=613.28s)]
*  keep saying to people that when you get into a position of power don't spend your time being [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=620.4s)]
*  fearful of losing it exercise power when you are there and for me this speech was exercising power [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  by saying this is a real issue and what I could see was what I saw as this respectable form of racism [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=632.24s)]
*  the kind of racism that you saw around the dinner tables of polite society the way in which people [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=640.0s)]
*  say oh we've had some Muslims moving next door but they're ever so nice they're not extreme [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=645.52s)]
*  they're quite moderate this kind of demarcation of moderates and extremists all the time [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=650.64s)]
*  the good Muslim bad Muslim narrative. They're kind of being surprised that there is a couple next door [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=656.48s)]
*  where there is one man and one woman the fact that they don't live this perceived lifestyle that has [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=663.04s)]
*  been superimposed on what Muslims should be and they don't have four wives shocking and so I think [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=669.52s)]
*  all this kind of stigmatizing of communities this demonizing of communities which has gone on over [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=675.84s)]
*  years and years and years had crept into not just the dinner tables of polite society but in think [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=681.36s)]
*  tanks in the corridors of power. You say in the book respectable racism. Respectable racism it was the kind of [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=687.36s)]
*  thing that was all right people would say I mean even people at polytoin we said I'm a you know [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=692.88s)]
*  I'm an Islamophobe and I'm proud of it and she's never disowned those I think she may have done but [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=697.68s)]
*  the point is at the time it was fine to say and there was no consequences in the Guardian to saying [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=702.0s)]
*  such a thing. You're right and you called attention to it in a very eloquent way what was the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=706.4s)]
*  reaction at the time you're in the conservative coalition government you're working for David [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  Cameron what did you get a backlash did people say shut the hell up? What was interesting was that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  the speech once it hit the front pages of the newspapers on the morning of the afternoon that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=721.92s)]
*  I was due to deliver that speech was when everybody went into overdrive and there was a huge amount of [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=728.0s)]
*  pressure put on me from number 10 and others to change the speech at that time and I refused to do [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  that because ultimately for me it was something important that needed to be said and was a line [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=739.36s)]
*  in the sand and is a moment that we now go back to 13 years on to say look this was what the [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=747.84s)]
*  situation was and often I think in politics if you can't make a difference then make a record [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=753.52s)]
*  start with at least logging these moments and part of this book and the reason why I keep writing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=759.6s)]
*  this is because future generations will look back at our generation Mehdi you know my generation I'm [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=765.44s)]
*  now nearly my mid-50s and say what the hell went wrong how did you allow it to get this bad how [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=771.2s)]
*  were you at the seat of power and you couldn't actually make this change so it's a good segue [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=777.04s)]
*  into what I really need to ask you about when you say how did you let it get this bad it is bad in [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=782.56s)]
*  the US we have an openly Islamophobic former president running for president again could very [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=787.76s)]
*  well win doesn't matter that he's surrounded by people like Laura Luma who say Islam is a cancer [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=792.56s)]
*  Muslims should be allowed to run for office this is his close advisor who was on his plane before [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=797.4399999999999s)]
*  the debate here in the UK we had horrific race riots but not just race rights Islamophobic [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=801.44s)]
*  riots specifically targeting not just immigrants and brown folks but Muslims right it was not a [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=807.6800000000001s)]
*  Sikh gurdwara or a Hindu temple that was surrounded by the mob it was a mosque in Southport where the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  worshipers thought they were going to die and with politicians and journalists unable to say the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=817.2800000000001s)]
*  I word Islamophobia you say how did it get that bad how do we go from the respectable racism of [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=821.7600000000001s)]
*  2010 2011 where Islamophobia is expressed through anti-terror strategies or discussions [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=827.92s)]
*  about integration or Jack Straw saying I'd like you to take off your face veil in my surgery that [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  the famous labor foreign secretary to basically old school racism the far right on the streets [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=838.0799999999999s)]
*  Islam being called a cancer the demonization of quote unquote to borrow an earlier title it will [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=843.92s)]
*  the enemy within how do we get that in 10 years I think it's been longer than 10 years I would say [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=849.12s)]
*  back to the Blair years under the labor government I think the language started then I think there's [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=854.08s)]
*  been a poisoning of the political of the public discourse and if you look at all the polling now [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=859.0400000000001s)]
*  in relation to British Muslims it reflects what happened over the last 10 15 20 years you can't [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=864.64s)]
*  have a situation where headline after headline after headline in the newspapers where politicians [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=870.48s)]
*  use this incendiary toxic language where where you know you have these discussions around whether [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=876.32s)]
*  or not for example Muslims are dangerous because they are groomers they are sexual predators [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  and then you have a report from the home office which says exactly the opposite and that the [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=889.36s)]
*  majority of child sexual exploitation is committed by white men and you have home secretaries who [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  bury that report so and this level of disinformation that has come out I wasn't [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=899.84s)]
*  surprised when the far-right racist riots happened when they attacked Muslims when Muslims were blamed [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=906.72s)]
*  for things they hadn't done when they were seen to be the ones that they wanted to blame even if [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  they weren't involved this has been a long time coming and it's what I have been warning about [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=918.0s)]
*  and that's why in some ways I think that stark manifestation of it on the streets of our country [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=922.4s)]
*  where people were being burned out of their buildings the equivalent of pogroms against [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=929.36s)]
*  Muslims was taking place that starkness maybe hopefully maybe the moment when we finally [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=935.2s)]
*  realize how serious it is and we pivot although once it happened we didn't see labor ministers [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=943.92s)]
*  saying Islamophobia very often they had to be pushed Yvette Cooper into saying it journalists [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=949.84s)]
*  very kind of resistant towards wanting to have an internal check that's labor and you talked about [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=954.8000000000001s)]
*  it starting in the Blair years we had prevent and the Iraq war and 7-7 and counterterrorism and all [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=960.08s)]
*  and I agree with that but let's be honest right now it is being driven on the right of the political [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=965.36s)]
*  spectrum by conservatives in the United States and now they're mini-mes in the United Kingdom [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=970.96s)]
*  we saw Liz Truss former prime minister former leader of your party sharing a stage with Steve [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=975.9200000000001s)]
*  Bannon in the US while he praised Tommy Robinson right there was no censure from the conservative [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=980.08s)]
*  party no consequences for her doing that you saw Boris Johnson as prime minister [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=984.64s)]
*  talking about Muslim women in very disparaging ways which led to a rise in hate crimes [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=989.6800000000001s)]
*  how does someone like you with these views writing these books number one end up in the [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=994.96s)]
*  conservative party at the top of the conservative party and number two why on earth are you still in [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1002.4000000000001s)]
*  the conservative party surely surely the low taxes only go so far I mean these are really [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1007.68s)]
*  important questions first of all how do how does somebody like me make it to the top of the [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1015.04s)]
*  conservative party I think the conservative party of today is very very different to the [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1019.12s)]
*  conservative party I joined two and a half decades you wouldn't have made it today I [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1023.8399999999999s)]
*  I think today to be a Muslim within the conservative party you have to completely [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1028.48s)]
*  sanitize your Muslimness and your identity to make it to the top so I would be coming up with [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1033.04s)]
*  some sort of nonsensical comments like I was born Muslim but don't really practice the faith it's [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  not a part of my identity it's not you know I would be coming up with all that kind of rubbish and one [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1043.76s)]
*  of the things that I imagine who you're referring to there with that people can google it people [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  can google it and and I think what would be in what I'm trying to do now with young Muslims coming [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1051.92s)]
*  into the party and I had a meeting with a whole group of them who were on the candidates list and [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1056.96s)]
*  didn't get selected to stand at this last election is to say to them that you unless you're allowed [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1063.92s)]
*  to bring your true self your authentic self to the table then this is a really corrosive place to be [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1069.2s)]
*  so where I think I still have a really healthy mindset although it's been a very toxic relationship [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1075.92s)]
*  is that I have never tried to hide who I am and I have never tried to sanitize my identity [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1081.28s)]
*  so even though it's tough and I get a lot of backlash I get a backlash for being me rather [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1088.16s)]
*  than a version of me that isn't correct so that you turned up for the first cabinet I remember [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1092.96s)]
*  in a shawl of our chemise in a pink shawl of our chemise yeah which which weirdly pretty [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1096.8799999999999s)]
*  patella and so on a brevverman have never done I think it's for me I am entirely comfortable [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  with my various identities and I genuinely thought you know those of us that felt that [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1107.04s)]
*  multiculturalism had succeeded and would be in social mobility success stories but you worked [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  for David Cameron as prime minister who was anti-multicultural went out of his way to attack [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1117.76s)]
*  multiculturalism I remember in a speech in Munich while the far right were marching through Luton a [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1122.24s)]
*  very brown town um again what were you doing there how did you justify that too I remember a lot of [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1126.6399999999999s)]
*  people would admire you in the Muslim community but then say yeah but she's in the conservative [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1132.88s)]
*  cabinet she's because of government she's just in it for herself she's in it for power otherwise [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1136.72s)]
*  she would stand down yeah I mean I think you have to decide um when you want to make a difference [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1140.3200000000002s)]
*  you can either do that by throwing bricks from the outside and protesting or you can feel confident [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1146.64s)]
*  enough to say I'm going to play my part at the centre and have all the battles on the inside [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1153.44s)]
*  and I don't think you're any stranger to the battles that I had within the conservative party [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1158.96s)]
*  much of it was in the public domain even during the time those battles were happening but you're [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1162.88s)]
*  still in the conservative party this is why I came to do this interview with you in 2024 I first met [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1166.96s)]
*  you I think 14 years ago what are you doing in this party this party is like a hard right islamophobic [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1170.96s)]
*  party every week we hear stories of some politician saying something ridiculous right we're meeting [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1178.24s)]
*  right now in the middle of a conservative party leadership contest where one of the leading [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1182.96s)]
*  candidates says that people who say Allah Akbar in the streets should get arrested right you have [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1186.08s)]
*  local councils saying outrageous things promises of investigations into islamophobia that never [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1190.96s)]
*  really materialize um how are you surviving in this party um why not say I'm done with it I'm [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1195.84s)]
*  not welcome here uh because I'm not prepared to leave the battlefield I'm not prepared to back [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1202.8799999999999s)]
*  down I'm not prepared to be told this is not my place if you look at every almost every single [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1211.04s)]
*  case of islamophobia that's been called out within the conservative party was called out by me the [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  push for a public inquiry was led by me it eventually was a bit of a whitewash but at least we got an [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1224.8s)]
*  inquiry the push to have the definition of islamophobia accepted within the conservative party [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1232.72s)]
*  was led by me and the conservative party in Scotland adopted it now you might say these are [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1238.64s)]
*  small wins but there would be no wins if people like me exited the conservative party I think [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  it's a pragmatic position no I mean I'm a centre-right politician right first of all I think if I looked [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1249.68s)]
*  at my politics as a whole I am a centre-right politician but I think that the conservative [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1254.8000000000002s)]
*  party's relationship with the muslim community is deeply toxic and flawed I think it needs to be why [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1259.92s)]
*  um is it because your party is a racist party I think my party has over time been ideologically [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1266.24s)]
*  taken over by people who are anti-muslim um I think that uh you know I have a joke with my [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1275.6s)]
*  with David Cameron where I say you know Michael Gove radicalized you David if you go back to the [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1284.08s)]
*  David of 2006 7 8 9 10 and look at the speeches that he was writing then that was the conservative [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1289.28s)]
*  he went and stayed with the muslim family if I remember he did in Birmingham and he talked about [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1295.52s)]
*  how integration was a two-way street he talked about how then he opened the door to Gove and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1299.2s)]
*  brexit and boris and that's where we are today he did but I also think that there are there are good [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1303.28s)]

*  fair to say the conservative party of today is institutionally islamophobic I think the party is [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1320.72s)]
*  institutionally islamophobic I've said that openly and I think that it was a a real shame that the [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1325.04s)]

*  me remaining in the conservative party is part of me staying and fighting because this is my country [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1561.36s)]
*  and I am not prepared to be told it's not one point I said earlier about people used to criticize [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1569.12s)]
*  you in the muslim community about she's in the conservative cabinet you then did become very [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1576.0s)]
*  popular with muslims and with people on the left even though you're a conservative back in 2014 [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1580.8s)]
*  during the 2014 Gaza war you were a minister in government and you quit the government very [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1586.4s)]
*  publicly it was a huge story at the time over Gaza you called it a morally indefensible policy of the [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1591.2s)]
*  British government to carry on supporting and arming Israel as they were killing Palestinians [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  at a rate that at the time seemed horrific but now looks like nothing compared to compared to [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1600.4s)]
*  today's genocide you write about it in the book and you say the war in Gaza was an inflection point [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1604.88s)]
*  where we saw with burning clarity the politicization and dismissal of muslim concerns [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1610.8799999999999s)]
*  the truth is you say that muslims don't matter unless they are villains I feel like you writing [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1615.9199999999998s)]
*  that in the middle of this current Gaza genocide must have been a weird feeling because whatever [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1620.32s)]
*  the dismissals were then whatever the villainization were then it's been steroids now post October the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1625.2s)]
*  7th is it not I feel like we've gone backwards post October the 7th completely I mean if you [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1630.08s)]
*  think about the arguments that I was having within government at the time to say we need to stop [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1634.1599999999999s)]
*  arming it sending arms to Israel we need to call this out we need to vote in the right way at the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1637.84s)]
*  human rights council and at the united nations and remember I was the minister for the UN for [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1643.1999999999998s)]
*  human rights for the ICC and the spokesperson for foreign affairs in the house of lords I was at the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1647.9199999999998s)]
*  center of this debate and I saw every single conversation that was happening within government [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1653.12s)]
*  and what became so obvious to me was that the British government in 2014 was simply not [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1658.3999999999999s)]
*  implementing the British policy on the middle east and everything I put in my resignation letter [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1664.8s)]
*  that day is it rings so true it breaks my heart to say I was absolutely on the ball when I said [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1670.8s)]
*  this is going to get worse unless we deal with the underlying issue of occupation unless we do [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1678.72s)]
*  something we can't just say we have a two-state policy and then do absolutely nothing about it [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1684.96s)]
*  we can't have a two-state policy and recognize only one we can't say we believe in international [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1689.44s)]
*  accountability and then penalize the Palestinians every time they go to the ICC the ICJ or any other [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1693.92s)]
*  international organization I mean there has to come a point when this fig leaf of a policy either [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1699.2s)]
*  we have to have the backbone to say this British policy is in words only and we have no intention [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1706.0s)]
*  of implementing it which makes us hypocrites and it's why I saw that hypocrisy in 2014 and felt [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1712.64s)]
*  that I could not be a part of that or we say we fundamentally believe in it and we start by [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1718.8s)]
*  recognizing Palestine and bringing about two states. Your former boss David Cameron who you were [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1724.1599999999999s)]
*  fond of he was foreign secretary for much of this year he came back into government to be the foreign [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1730.56s)]
*  minister his big challenge was Gaza a lot of people criticized Cameron for not following the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1735.52s)]
*  legal advice there's a big debate about what legal advice he was offered or whether the arms sales [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1741.2s)]
*  were legal do you believe there was I don't want to use the phrase cover-up but I'll use the phrase [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1745.6s)]
*  cover-up do you believe there was a cover-up in the British government because labor have come in [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1749.76s)]
*  now and said okay we are going to suspend a minority of license it's a small step but a step [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1753.28s)]
*  why did Cameron not follow the legal advice? When David became foreign secretary I actually [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  thought it was a positive moment I thought James Cleverley was terrible I felt like there was no [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1765.28s)]
*  real sense of his predecessor his predecessor I felt that there was no sense of a grown-up [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1770.08s)]
*  who understood these issues there was also no secret of David's relationship with Netanyahu [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1775.44s)]
*  which he really doesn't have much time for him and I felt like he understood the person he was [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1780.16s)]
*  dealing with in the Middle East and understood these issues and remember it was David Cameron who [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1785.28s)]
*  first used the phrase that Gaza is an open-air prison and he talked about how these these [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1789.92s)]
*  matters needed to be resolved and actually he started off well started off strong talked about [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1795.8400000000001s)]
*  ceasefire talked about the violence in the West Bank talked about the sanctioning of those groups [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1801.1200000000001s)]
*  who were leading that violence but there were almost two David Cameras you see this is the [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1806.4s)]
*  issue I've had with David Cameron throughout his career on a personal level I am incredibly fond of [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1811.1200000000001s)]
*  him he's a thoroughly decent nice human being good person to work with and actually leaves you to [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1815.6s)]
*  get on with your job and is somebody who builds a broad church but there were two David Cameras [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1821.1200000000001s)]
*  there was the David Cameron pre-Christmas and then there was David Cameron post-Christmas [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1827.92s)]
*  and I've always fascinated I'd just be fascinated to know which parties he went to over Christmas [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1834.24s)]
*  and New Year because something fundamentally changed in his language and his approach [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1838.5600000000002s)]
*  from what happened in late 2023 to what happened post early 2024 and I genuinely hope that this [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1844.72s)]
*  period including the time when David was there and you know now with the new foreign sec David [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1854.16s)]
*  Lammy I do hope that this period is put under a microscope because if our politicians are not [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1861.6000000000001s)]
*  being led by our policy and our values and our commitment to the rule of law and international [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1872.3200000000002s)]
*  accountability then that's a really dangerous place to be do you believe the British government [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1880.64s)]
*  and when I say British government I mean the conservative government of Sunak after October [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1886.4s)]
*  7th and now the Labour government of Kirstama David Lammy do you believe the British government [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1890.0s)]
*  is complicit in war crimes in Gaza I think that war crimes have been committed in Gaza and I feel [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1894.0s)]
*  that we have not done enough to stop them but are we complicit in it by arming them I think that's a [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1900.64s)]
*  judgment that would have to be made I know asking for your judgment but it's I think you're a [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1907.12s)]
*  private citizen now you can tell me your views and I think I'm also a lawyer and I'm also somebody [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1910.9599999999998s)]
*  who served at the highest level and therefore I am you know cautious about how I use my language [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1915.84s)]
*  but I that's why I said it is important that this period of British policy making is scrutinized [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1920.8799999999999s)]
*  and put into the microscope and it is made absolutely clear to the British people why we [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1927.04s)]
*  were making decisions that fundamentally do not seem to be in line with our own policy and our [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1932.72s)]
*  own values let me ask you a non-legal question then do you believe this period in British [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1938.08s)]
*  government history and foreign policy is a moral stain on the UK absolutely and just on the [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1942.72s)]
*  fallout in the UK Muslims being demonized again do you condemn terrorism the questions come back [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1950.16s)]
*  with a vengeance with Hamas like it was with Al-Qaeda after 7-7 how hard has it been to maintain [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1955.76s)]
*  Muslim-Jewish relations you do a podcast with the Jewish comedian and author David Baddiel [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1962.56s)]
*  how hard has that been has there been a backlash for you for him having those tricky conversations [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1967.28s)]
*  at a time when the two communities have probably never been further apart you know almost any space [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fpkgqu-7HTQ&t=1972.1599999999999s)]
