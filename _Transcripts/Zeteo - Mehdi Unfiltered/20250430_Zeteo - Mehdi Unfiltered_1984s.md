Video Description: US Democrats face record low approval ratings. That’s why prominent liberal journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson wrote ‘Abundance’ — a new book arguing that liberals need to innovate more by deregulating the government and developing a pro-business mindset.

The bestselling book garnered buzz and controversy — and Thompson joins Mehdi Hasan on ‘Mehdi Unfiltered’ to unpack it all.

They discuss the abundance agenda, and Mehdi presses Thompson on the book’s criticism from progressives, including its lack of focus on Republicans and oligarchy.

The author tells Mehdi that liberals are getting in their own way when it comes to building homes and green energy infrastructure, saying, “when you're trying to explain why some states like Texas are building ample housing and some states like California simply aren't, I don't think you can say that the problem is oligarchy.”

Thompson and Mehdi discuss the future of the Democratic Party, challenging Donald Trump and MAGA, Bernie Sanders and AOC, and the “orphaned center-right.” Watch the *FULL interview* to see Thompson admit that he and Klein got some things wrong.

# Mehdi CHALLENGES Derek Thompson on the ‘Abundance Agenda’ and Democrats
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU)
*  A provocative and bestselling new book is arguing that in order to create a future of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=0.0s)]
*  abundance rather than scarcity, liberals need to build and invent more. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=4.36s)]
*  And in order to do that, they need to take on government regulations and zoning requirements [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=9.1s)]
*  and also develop a more pro-business mindset. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=13.4s)]
*  It's co-authored by two prominent liberal journalists, Ezra Klein of The New York Times [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=16.2s)]
*  and Derek Thompson from The Atlantic. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=20.2s)]
*  And it's called Abundance. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=22.36s)]
*  The Abundance Agenda aims to create a future that doesn't revolve around scarcity, building [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  more homes, creating more jobs, innovating in green energy infrastructure and technology [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=28.92s)]
*  and making new strides in healthcare. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=34.24s)]
*  For example, the two write for government to do more or even for it to just do what [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=36.64s)]
*  it's already doing, sometimes it first needs permission to do much less. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  But not everyone is buying into what Klein and Thompson are selling as a path forward [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=45.52s)]
*  for Democrats. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=49.08s)]
*  In the Age of Maga Extremism, in a review of the book titled Abundance is How Dems Lose [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=50.24s)]
*  The Leavers, David Sirota writes that ultimately the rhetoric put forward by Doge and Abundance [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=56.26s)]
*  feature some of the same main villains. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=61.36s)]
*  Red tape, bureaucracy, overregulation and lefty do-gooderism gone wrong. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  So is Abundance the way forward for liberals and the left? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=68.42s)]
*  Is it what's going to win the Democrats the White House in 2028? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=71.78s)]
*  Or is it what helped cost them the White House in 2024? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=75.06s)]
*  Joining me now is The Atlantic's Derek Thompson, co-author of Abundance. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=78.82s)]
*  Derek, thanks so much for coming on the show. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=82.06s)]
*  It's wonderful to be here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=84.48s)]
*  Thank you for the very comprehensive summary. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=85.48s)]
*  I think that was a really good say. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=87.76s)]
*  We try, we try. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=89.26s)]
*  So I do want to challenge you on some stuff in the book. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  But before we get to that, for those that aren't familiar, and your new book with Ezra [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=92.24000000000001s)]
*  Klein has provoked a lot of discussion and debate, including criticisms, as I mentioned [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=95.92s)]
*  from the left, can you briefly explain, lay out in your own words, what you mean by Abundance [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  and what the Abundance agenda is? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=105.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=107.44s)]
*  We try to put it as plainly as we can in the introduction. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=108.44s)]
*  We say that to have the future that liberals want, we need to find ways to build and invent [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=110.7s)]
*  more of what we need. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=115.38s)]
*  And that starts with housing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=116.62s)]
*  The first chapter is about housing and the obvious and objective failures of many states [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=117.62s)]
*  and cities that are governed by Democrats to add adequate housing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=122.8s)]
*  The rates of homelessness tend to be highest in cities and states that are governed by [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=130.3s)]
*  That's for several reasons. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=131.3s)]
*  But I think a huge part of it is the fact that we've gotten in our own way in terms [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=132.3s)]
*  of adding sufficient supply in places that have high demand for housing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=135.2s)]
*  We then move on to energy and talk about the incredible need for the United States [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=140.12s)]
*  to build more clean energy if we want to meet our climate change goals and export that energy [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=143.70000000000002s)]
*  to the rest of the world so that people around the world can get richer while using technology, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=147.8s)]
*  energy technology that doesn't require simply burning what we find in the ground, but uses [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  solar and wind to generate ample energy that can help people live these rich lives in ways [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=156.72s)]
*  that are clean for the entire biosphere. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=162.78s)]
*  And then after that, we talk about good governance is really, really important, I think. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=165.0s)]
*  Liberals are focused not just on the processes that live in law, but also the fact that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=168.96s)]
*  we have governments that can do what they are elected to do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=173.84s)]
*  That is to build housing and infrastructure and transit and energy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  And then as you mentioned, the end of the book is about science and technology, because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it's really important to have a progressive movement in this country that sees the value [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=183.96s)]
*  of science and technology, a value that I think, ironically, you know, you mentioned [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=189.32s)]
*  in some ways, maybe we are a kind of, you know, dark doge compared to what Elon Musk [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=192.98000000000002s)]
*  is offering from the right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=197.32s)]
*  I don't think this administration understands at all the value of science and technology. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=198.6s)]
*  They are threatening to cut 40 percent of the budget. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  They are attacking universities. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=206.28s)]
*  They are tearing down aspects of the Department of Energy, like the loan programs office that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=207.76s)]
*  have been essential for helping to build energy projects in this country. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=212.95999999999998s)]
*  So you put that all together. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  You have a future of a plan for a lens for seeing abundance in housing and energy and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=217.66s)]
*  government competence, science and technology. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=224.04s)]
*  So you've said that the abundance agenda is the, quote, perfect negatively polarized [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=227.04s)]
*  message against the Trump administration. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=231.16s)]
*  Can you explain what you mean by that exactly? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=236.2s)]
*  I think that Donald Trump doesn't see the possibility of positive some exchanges in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=237.2s)]
*  the world. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  And that means that every single time he identifies some deprivation of the United States, he [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=242.16s)]
*  seeks to take something else away. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=247.0s)]
*  So for example, he sees the US doesn't have enough manufacturing and he says what we need [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=248.89999999999998s)]
*  is less trade. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=252.84s)]
*  Or he says the US doesn't have enough housing. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=254.04s)]
*  So what we need are fewer immigrants or what the US has is an issue with our debt. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=255.96s)]
*  So what we need isn't growth, but we need to catastrophically cut everything that government [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=261.52s)]
*  does, especially for the neediest and the most marginalized. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=265.68s)]
*  This is a situation where every time he's identifying something Americans don't have [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=268.92s)]
*  enough of, he's taking away something that we need. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=273.36s)]
*  Scarcity meaning scarcity. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=276.0s)]
*  And against that message of scarcity, the getting scarcity, ours is a message of abundance. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=277.4s)]
*  We need more houses. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=281.76s)]
*  Let's build them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=282.84s)]
*  We need more clean energy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=283.84s)]
*  Let's find ways to build it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=284.84s)]
*  We need more manufacturing in this country. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=286.2s)]
*  Let's embrace a pro-growth industrial strategy that really finds a way of helping American [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=288.4s)]
*  factories build more of what we need for national security purposes. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=293.76s)]
*  Not textiles or whatever it is that we're trying to do with our tariffs against China, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  but chips and solar panels and other military technology that is essential for national [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=302.52s)]
*  security. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  That is our message of abundance that I think works very cleanly, cuts a very clean line [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=311.08s)]
*  against the scarcity of the Trump administration. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=316.04s)]
*  So that's true in a way. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  And the worry though is, of course, as you know, that despite you and Ezra being very [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=322.56s)]
*  anti-Trump and you describing this agenda as anti-Trump, I think you say in the book [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=325.76s)]
*  or in one of the interviews around the book that Democrats can beat Trump with this message [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=329.4s)]
*  that Trump came from a scarcity era. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=334.4s)]
*  Some of the Trump people are haling it, Derek. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=338.24s)]
*  Elon Musk literally shared a clip of Ezra, your co-author, explaining to a bewildered [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Jon Stewart how Joe Biden's expansion of broadband Internet failed to be successful. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=345.76s)]
*  I think we've got the clip. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=350.0s)]
*  Let's play some of it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=351.0s)]
*  This is the Biden administration's process for its own bill. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=352.0s)]
*  They wanted this to happen. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=356.2s)]
*  This is how liberal government works now. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=358.32s)]
*  This is something they instituted for this bill. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=360.32s)]
*  For their bill. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=365.16s)]
*  This is a bill passed by Democrats with a regulatory structure written by Democratic [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=366.44s)]
*  administration. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=371.92s)]
*  OK, right. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=372.92s)]
*  So I want to come back to the content of what Ezra said in a moment. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=373.92s)]
*  Before we get to that, Musk shared that clip, Derek, I'm sure you saw, and he said, quote, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=377.12s)]
*  this shows why regulatory overhaul is necessary. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=381.08s)]
*  The burden of mountains of regulations is why the high speed rail can't get down in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=384.04s)]
*  California and the can't get done, sorry, in California and the bridge that the ship [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=387.32s)]
*  hit still hasn't been fixed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=391.0s)]
*  Now you can understand why that worries your progressive critics. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=392.8s)]
*  The Republicans have always wanted deregulation. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=396.28s)]
*  And here are two prominent liberals seeming to make the case for them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=398.96s)]
*  Because he says something on Twitter doesn't mean that it actually represents his values [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=422.76s)]
*  and doesn't mean that it has anything to do with what is actually right in the world. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=427.2s)]
*  Here's what I think is right in the world. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=431.56s)]
*  I think that the government has a lot of rules and some of those rules are fantastic. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=433.4s)]
*  They make the air and the water cleaner. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=437.8s)]
*  They make workers lives healthier. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=439.8s)]
*  They make it easier for people to afford health insurance or to retire outside of poverty. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=442.3s)]
*  Some rules are fantastic. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=447.8s)]
*  But just as everyone in, say, sports understands that some rules are good and some rules are [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=449.48s)]
*  bad, some rules in government are bad. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=453.6s)]
*  Some rules in government keep the government from being able to do what they were elected [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=456.16s)]
*  to do. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=459.78000000000003s)]
*  There are environmental rules like NEPA that I think make it harder for government to build [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=460.90000000000003s)]
*  housing and clean energy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=464.36s)]
*  I think that in states like California, there are rules like CEQA that make it almost impossible [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=466.36s)]
*  to fulfill the affordable housing needs that cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=471.76s)]
*  have. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=476.44s)]
*  What you're talking about right here with the clip of Ezra on Jon Stewart, there was [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=477.52s)]
*  this $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that Joe Biden passed or signed in 2021. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=482.16s)]
*  There was a feature of it called BEAD, Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, which reserved [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=487.04s)]
*  $42 billion to build rural broadband for people that were underserved by their internet service [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=492.0s)]
*  providers. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=496.64s)]
*  We've learned a lot, frankly, about how exactly this law was put together. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=498.76s)]
*  Ezra just wrote a column for the New York Times explaining how in some ways his interview [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=503.0s)]
*  with Jon Stewart got things absolutely right. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=506.88s)]
*  And in some ways, to be totally honest, he and I got some things wrong when we were initially [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=509.15999999999997s)]
*  talking about this bill. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=513.68s)]
*  The Biden administration, which no longer exists, but people who were senior in the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=515.08s)]
*  Biden administration were very upset with that clip and that argument. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=518.48s)]
*  In fact, they were very, like Bharat Ramamurthy, who I'm sure you know, former Deputy Director [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=521.6s)]
*  of President Biden's National Economic Council, he actually called that clip deeply misleading [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=525.2s)]
*  and saying that the process, the cumbersome broadband process, was largely the insistence [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=529.66s)]
*  of GOP senators as a condition for their votes for that infrastructure act. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=534.48s)]
*  And he says these GOP politicians acted at the behest of large incumbent internet providers [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=539.04s)]
*  who did not want a dollar spent to build new infrastructure where they were already providing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=543.58s)]
*  service. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  Another former Biden official, Alex Jackes, I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing his name [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  correctly, said, it's disappointing to see Ezra Klein get lazy to sell books here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=551.28s)]
*  The irony is that we had a simple, straightforward broadband bill, moderate Dems and Republicans [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=555.96s)]
*  forced a state by state Frankenstein instead. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=560.44s)]
*  They're saying, not just you got it wrong, they're saying you're being misleading to [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=563.36s)]
*  sell books. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=566.0s)]
*  Biden folks tend not to be very emotive from my experience. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=567.0s)]
*  That's pretty strong attack on you both. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, we're definitely not misleading on purpose to sell books, right? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=571.2s)]
*  We were trying to represent our best understanding of the BID program as we understand it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=574.32s)]
*  And when we published our first or when it was published, our first descriptions of this [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=578.6800000000001s)]
*  bill, people like Bharat, as you said, people from the Biden administration got in touch [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=582.6s)]
*  with us and they said, you're not actually describing the way that this bill was put [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=585.92s)]
*  together accurately. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=589.24s)]
*  There's some nuance that you're missing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=590.48s)]
*  And so we listened. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=592.0s)]
*  Ezra published an article in The New York Times, like a 1500, 1800 word article, where [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=593.64s)]
*  he talked to people like Jake Sullivan and Bharat with Biden's economic team. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=596.96s)]
*  And they said, look, in some ways, you've described, you've incorrectly described the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=601.44s)]
*  elements that were responsible for this 14 step process, this Frankenstein monster. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=607.48s)]
*  But in other ways, and this is so important, in other ways, you've underrepresented just [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=611.8s)]
*  how difficult it is to build anything in government in part because of the rules that we've put [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=617.36s)]
*  in our own way. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=623.16s)]
*  Jake Sullivan has this absolutely sensational quote in the piece where he says that any [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=624.36s)]
*  single every single time the government essentially tries to step into the physical world to [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=630.04s)]
*  build something, they are entirely swept up in rules and regulations. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=633.8s)]
*  You know, the Lilliputians, you know, sweeping up Gulliver with with their with their rope. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=638.7199999999999s)]
*  And so there's a way in which a really subtle way in which, yes, the reason why this law [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=643.04s)]
*  was overlauded with regulations had to do with rules that Republicans and ISPs, Internet [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=648.0799999999999s)]
*  Service Providers, wanted to overlay into the law. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=653.92s)]
*  But you didn't say that in the book or in the interview. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  You can see that you missed that out. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=659.9599999999999s)]
*  You're telling me you got some of it wrong. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=661.68s)]
*  You just said that a few moments ago. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=663.64s)]
*  Yes, yes. We we got some of this wrong in the process of describing it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  But just be clear, the beat example was not in the book. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  The broad-went equity access and deployment example appears nowhere in the book. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=672.4399999999999s)]
*  We heard about this partly because I was talking to heads of heads of transportation [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=676.64s)]
*  departments in states who were telling me, you don't understand how bad what Ezra calls [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=683.0799999999999s)]
*  everything big liberalism is at the state level. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=687.76s)]
*  It has become so impossible to get money from the government, to get money from the Biden [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=690.12s)]
*  administration, to build rural broadband. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=694.36s)]
*  We can't believe how hard it is to get anything done. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  So it's not and I'm not disputing that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=699.92s)]
*  And I appreciate it. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=702.52s)]
*  Just important to finish, as we were trying to accurately relay what we were hearing from [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=704.8s)]
*  states, we ended up not telling the full story as it applied to exactly how bipartisan [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=710.6s)]
*  infrastructure law came together. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=716.92s)]
*  Then as we got more information, we changed the way that we talk about it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=718.24s)]
*  So on that note, it's a very complicated story, as clearly as we can. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=721.28s)]
*  Understood. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=726.6s)]
*  And learning about how it how it actually happened. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=727.04s)]
*  So I'm glad you made that point, because that leads me to my next question, which is, did [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  you make that mistake? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=732.64s)]
*  Because at the big picture level, you are so focused on Democrats and not on Republicans [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=734.3199999999999s)]
*  or corporate power. As you know, many of your left wing critics have said corporate power [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=740.56s)]
*  is missing from this book. So when you say, you know, he very Ezra, very and I know Ezra [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=744.08s)]
*  well, he said it very confidently in that John Stewart. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=748.56s)]
*  This was a Democrat bill. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=751.0s)]
*  This was the Democrats. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=752.28s)]
*  No mention of Republicans and Internet providers. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=753.36s)]
*  And as I said on another podcast with you on Pod Save America, he said this about [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=755.48s)]
*  progressives, quote, there are certain kinds of problems they're willing to see and certain [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=759.5600000000001s)]
*  kinds of problems they're unwilling to see. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=762.64s)]
*  100 percent true. But I wonder, does that also apply to him and to you and to this book? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=764.36s)]
*  You kind of turned a blind eye to corporate power, to oligarchy. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=769.44s)]
*  I did a search of the book. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=773.6s)]
*  The words oligarchy and billionaire appear nowhere in the book. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=775.0400000000001s)]
*  The words corporate and corporation. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=778.24s)]
*  I counted six times in the entire book. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=780.0400000000001s)]
*  Was that a deliberate choice to just ignore all that? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  No, it wasn't a deliberate choice. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=787.1600000000001s)]
*  You know, we're trying to represent reality as clearly as we see it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=788.56s)]
*  And so when it comes to oligarchy and corporate power, when you're trying to explain [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=791.4s)]
*  why some states like Texas are building ample housing and some states like California [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=795.76s)]
*  simply aren't, I don't think you can say that the problem is oligarchy. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=799.8s)]
*  There's no way in which the state of Texas has something like 70 percent less oligarchy [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  than the state of California. That clearly isn't the key ingredient here in order to [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=808.4799999999999s)]
*  explain why Houston builds houses in San Francisco doesn't. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=812.88s)]
*  Why Dallas and Plano build houses, but Boston and Seattle and Portland don't. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=816.8399999999999s)]
*  It's not about the variable density of oligarchy across these markets. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=821.4s)]
*  It is in many cases about local rules and regulations. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=825.92s)]
*  It's about zoning. It's about permitting. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=829.52s)]
*  It's about environmental review. It's about the local defaults. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=831.16s)]
*  So we're trying to tell a story that answers specific questions. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=834.64s)]
*  If you're interested in understanding the question of why is housing so scarce [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=837.8399999999999s)]
*  in so many liberal markets? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=842.76s)]
*  I think it's important to look at the rules and not to look just at oligarchy. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=845.0s)]
*  That said, I really want to make this clear. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  There are some questions about American economics that are answered in the affirmative. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=852.32s)]
*  The question is, is oligarchy responsible for this? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=857.6s)]
*  OK, there are markets that are highly concentrated. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=860.8000000000001s)]
*  If you're interested in hospital consolidation or the concentration, the market concentration [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=863.1600000000001s)]
*  of dialysis market, especially in the South, absolutely, there are places where monopoly [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=868.56s)]
*  power and market concentration plays an enormous role in the outcomes that liberals [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=873.76s)]
*  and aggressors want. We're trying to answer. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=878.4399999999999s)]
*  We're trying to ask and answer relatively narrow questions and to do that to the best of our ability. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=880.72s)]
*  And if the narrow questions that we're asking about housing and energy, I do not think that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=885.72s)]
*  oligarchy is the prime active ingredient. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=890.4399999999999s)]
*  That does not mean that oligarchy doesn't exist, that market concentration doesn't exist. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=893.76s)]
*  And I trust. So I'll come back to the narrowness in a moment. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=898.68s)]
*  I'm glad you're setting me up for my future. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=900.96s)]
*  I want to talk about the narrow vision. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=902.6s)]
*  But before that, on oligarchy, one of your loudest critics, David Sirota, who I mentioned [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=904.04s)]
*  earlier, the leader, former Bernie Sanders speechwriter, he criticizes abundance for not [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=908.04s)]
*  focusing on concentrated corporate power, the role it plays in jacking up house prices [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=911.96s)]
*  and rents or the role that big oil plays in preventing action on climate change that you [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=916.16s)]
*  say you want to see. You started the interview mentioning the need to get more clean energy. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=921.24s)]
*  Sirota says, and I quote, we could pass all the federal permitting reforms climate [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=925.08s)]
*  Thompson could dream of. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=929.12s)]
*  But if powerful fossil fuel interests continue to call the political shots, we'll never [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=930.92s)]
*  achieve the clean energy bill that we desperately need. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=934.68s)]
*  That's undeniable, isn't it? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  Like we could agree to every single zoning reform that you might want. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=938.68s)]
*  But, you know, big oil spent one hundred fifty million dollars lobbying last year. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=942.36s)]
*  Donald Trump is now in office and doing their bidding at a federal level. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=945.36s)]
*  That's just undeniable. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  You can't say that the climate change infrastructure problem in America is one of zoning and [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=949.56s)]
*  not big oil. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=953.28s)]
*  I would absolutely argue that an enormous part of the fact that American states cannot [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=954.92s)]
*  build clean energy is because it has become practically impossible to actually alter the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=961.92s)]
*  physical environment without immediately incorporating permitting laws, environmental [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=968.36s)]
*  review and a host of other lawsuits that keep us from building. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=973.32s)]
*  I think it's absolutely undeniable. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=977.32s)]
*  Now, do I think that big oil companies have enormous lobbying efforts that in many ways [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=978.96s)]
*  throttle the development of clean energy? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=984.64s)]
*  Yes, I do think that that exists. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=986.68s)]
*  I do think that that is a bigger problem. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=988.84s)]
*  I'm just wondering. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=991.12s)]
*  I do not. I do not think it explains, though, why the state of Texas builds so much more [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=992.36s)]
*  solar power than the state of Massachusetts, even on a per capita level. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=998.88s)]
*  But you know that Donald Trump is now rolling back all solar power and wind power. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1003.12s)]
*  That's a Republican president. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1006.88s)]
*  And that's a separate issue. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1008.04s)]
*  You're bringing up a separate issue, which is totally fair. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1009.0s)]
*  But the first issue was whether or not big oil lobbying was responsible for the differences [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1011.16s)]
*  in solar power construction in Massachusetts and Texas. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't believe that it is. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1018.6s)]
*  The second question is whether Donald Trump is entirely opposed to our clean energy [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1019.92s)]
*  agenda. To the second question, the answer is absolutely. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1024.3999999999999s)]
*  He's not just opposed. He's imposed and he's opposed to it in such an embarrassing way [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1027.96s)]
*  that he has folks from the energy department coming in and essentially saying we're for an [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  all of the above energy strategy. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1035.44s)]
*  And immediately they go about trying to dismantle solar and wind and anything that smacks [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1037.2s)]
*  the Biden agenda. I mean, he right now is trying to tear down the loan programs office, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1041.12s)]
*  which if you're a real infrastructure nerd, you understand to be one of the most successful [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1045.8799999999999s)]
*  sources of capital for new clean energy construction projects in the country. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1050.9599999999998s)]
*  Trump is trying to destroy it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1055.1599999999999s)]
*  So absolutely. There are enemies here outside of local rules and regulations. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1056.76s)]
*  Of course, there are, especially with the Trump administration. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1062.4799999999998s)]
*  We could not have possibly written a book that was about actions the Trump administration [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1065.32s)]
*  took in March of 2025 because the book was finished in November. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1069.32s)]
*  I don't think that's the criticism. I think it's ignoring of the role. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1073.4399999999998s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on. I don't think anyone was suggesting you should write about a future Trump [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1077.24s)]
*  administration. But the idea that the big blocks and I know you don't agree with it, but this is a [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1080.72s)]
*  big tension. There is a debate about what is the big block. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1085.0s)]
*  And many people would say it's a fossil fuel industry that spends one hundred and fifty million dollars on [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1088.0s)]
*  lobbying. It's the airline industry that goes out of its way in places like Texas, Southwest [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1092.36s)]
*  Airlines to block high speed rail. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1097.04s)]
*  Have you talked to a CEO of a solar company? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1098.52s)]
*  Not recently. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1101.44s)]
*  I think it'd be interesting to do that. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1102.44s)]
*  I think it'd be interesting to talk to folks who are CEOs of solar companies and wind companies and [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1104.84s)]
*  enhanced geothermal companies and nuclear power, modular nuclear power companies. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1109.04s)]
*  Have them on the show and ask them how big a deal, how big an implement or how big a bottleneck [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1112.8s)]
*  is big oil lobbying to your efforts to build solar in places like California. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1119.8s)]
*  My guess from my reporting is that they will say it's a tertiary issue. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1125.52s)]
*  It's not that it doesn't exist. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1130.52s)]
*  It's just not as important as financing local permitting for projects, getting money and being able to [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1132.24s)]
*  break ground. Well, as you and I just agreed, the financing now is being withdrawn by a Republican [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1138.36s)]
*  administration at the federal level. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1142.8s)]
*  Absolutely. We have no debate there. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1144.56s)]
*  And that's big oil influencing them. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1146.48s)]
*  So let's talk about the politics if we're out of time. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1149.08s)]
*  So Bernie Sanders is leading rallies of tens of thousands of people right now. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1151.04s)]
*  A lot of people saying the Democratic Party is shifting left. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1155.0s)]
*  The base wants more fighters. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1157.16s)]
*  They want more progressive action. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1158.68s)]
*  AOC is doing well in polling. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1159.92s)]
*  A lot of your critics mentioned that Bernie Sanders gets a passing reference in the book, I think one [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1162.84s)]
*  time. But you do heap praise on Elon Musk, who you call a walking advertisement for what public will [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1166.24s)]
*  and private genius can unlock. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1171.04s)]
*  And you yourself have said much of what Peter Thiel says is, and I quote, quite brilliant. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1173.52s)]
*  Thiel is someone who is openly anti-democracy, calls Greta Thunberg a competitor to the anti-Christ. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1178.64s)]
*  Again, Derek, do you understand why a lot of progressives see this and go, whoa, are these guys, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1183.16s)]
*  whose side are these guys on? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1188.04s)]
*  You must understand that. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1189.56s)]
*  Do you have the full paragraphs or the quotes about Peter Thiel and Elon Musk? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1191.2s)]
*  Because they are not positive examples of these men's record. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1193.92s)]
*  They are. We are in these paragraphs describing ways in which we agree with aspects of the pro-tech [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1197.3600000000001s)]
*  argument while also dramatically opposing the degree to which Peter Thiel doesn't believe in democracy. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1205.6s)]
*  He's a libertarian. He doesn't even believe in Social Security. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1211.3999999999999s)]
*  No one who reads this book, I think, will be actively confused that we are arguing for a pro Peter Thiel [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1214.24s)]
*  party. No one reading this book will be confused that we are pro-Elon Musk doge folks who want to cut USAID [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1222.32s)]
*  and cut the NIH. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1229.24s)]
*  The policies that we recommend in this book are the exact opposite of the policies of the Trump [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1230.72s)]
*  administration. And there there's going to be absolutely no confusion. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1236.68s)]
*  But I will say this. I do think that you mentioned Bernie Sanders, you mentioned AOC. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1240.68s)]
*  You know, there is a fight right now. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1246.44s)]
*  I won't even say a fight. It's not violent. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1248.4s)]
*  There's a debate about what the Democratic Party should be. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1249.92s)]
*  Right now, the Democratic Party brand is polling at, you know, this better than I did, what, 27, 29 percent [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1252.3200000000002s)]
*  CNN poll. So basically, the Democratic Party is about as unpopular as it's ever been. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1257.28s)]
*  And there's a little bit of a skirmish to define the future of this party. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1261.4399999999998s)]
*  And there's some folks who want to define it as an antitrust party and some folks who want to define it as an [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1264.56s)]
*  anti-oligarch party. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1269.36s)]
*  And to be clear, I think that antitrust policy is important and I think oligarchy is responsible for very particular [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  problems in America. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1276.32s)]
*  This is a this is this is a distinct vision of the idea that Democrats need to be not only popular but also [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1277.76s)]
*  effective in the places where they wield power. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1285.12s)]
*  And it is, it is ironic and profound, I think, that many of the places where Democrats wield the most power in [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1287.6799999999998s)]
*  cities and states like San Francisco and Los Angeles and California and Oregon, people are leaving. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1293.4399999999998s)]
*  The working class is leaving in droves. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1299.12s)]
*  That is a very expensive vote against local leadership. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1301.6799999999998s)]
*  And if Democrats want a party that communicates authority and competence to the public, it needs to be able to [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1305.4399999999998s)]
*  handle the places in which it currently governs. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1312.48s)]
*  And that is a really, really. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1314.88s)]
*  That is a very, that is a very, very fair point. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1316.32s)]
*  And I'm not going to I'm not going to disagree with you on that. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1318.48s)]
*  Just stick it with the politics of this. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1320.8s)]
*  The book suggests that the problems identified by abundance help Trump win. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1322.04s)]
*  I think there's a line in there. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1325.56s)]
*  Last year, Kamala Harris was in many ways the abundance candidate. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1328.72s)]
*  We didn't have Bernie Sanders as the Democratic presidential candidate. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1332.76s)]
*  The Washington Post even ran an op-ed last October saying, and I quote, the Democratic nominee increasingly appears to be [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1335.6s)]
*  running on an abundance agenda. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1340.4s)]
*  Your critics would say the party tried your way and they lost. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1342.6s)]
*  I don't agree with that interpretation. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1347.72s)]
*  I think it's an interpretation that people can hold and I certainly can't determine what other people think. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1349.68s)]
*  I don't think it's the clearest way of seeing what happened in 2024. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1353.96s)]
*  Look at the advertisements that the Trump administration ran against Kamala Harris to understand what they thought were the [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1359.56s)]
*  most powerful arguments against the Harris ticket. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1367.2s)]
*  Were they criticizing her position on housing? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1370.24s)]
*  Were they criticizing the fact that she wanted to build more homes and clean energy? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1373.36s)]
*  Or are they criticizing positions that she took on cultural issues in 2019? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1378.56s)]
*  I think the answer is very clearly the latter. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1384.12s)]
*  What that tells me that's kind of complicated when it comes to evaluating the ideological identity of Kamala Harris's [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1386.4s)]
*  2024 campaign is that in a way there were two Harris campaigns. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1392.96s)]
*  There was a campaign that Harris was trying to run in 2024, both hugging Joe Biden and also distancing herself from him, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1397.0400000000002s)]
*  which I, by the way, think was a terrible mistake. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1404.0800000000002s)]
*  I agree. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1405.5200000000002s)]
*  And I think that you think so too. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1405.76s)]
*  But also there was like this parallel campaign that people were being reminded of, of Kamala Harris's identity as a much more [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1407.76s)]
*  culturally progressive political figure during the Democratic primary season of 2019. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1415.3600000000001s)]
*  And that makes it very hard to evaluate to what degree were people against Kamala Harris voting against Kamala Harris [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1420.72s)]
*  because she thought they thought she was too moderate or too liberal. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1425.76s)]
*  I think that a fair reading of polling of how people felt about Kamala Harris who weren't voting for her [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1429.84s)]
*  shows that Republicans or I should say moderates, independents who voted for Trump over Kamala Harris, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1437.28s)]
*  overwhelmingly did so thinking that she was too liberal rather than thinking that she was too moderate. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1442.52s)]
*  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, Derry. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1448.36s)]
*  I'm not disagreeing with the two points you made about the parallel campaigns, but I would add an extra layer, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1449.6s)]
*  which is we know a lot of Democrats stayed at home and a lot of the polling since the election suggests they stayed at home [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1454.0s)]
*  because they didn't think she was fighting for them enough. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1458.76s)]
*  They didn't think she was a voice for them enough. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1461.32s)]
*  They didn't think she was offering enough change. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1462.96s)]
*  You know, Donald Trump was the burn it down, you know, anti-system candidate. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1465.4s)]
*  Harris was very the safe candidate. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1469.08s)]
*  And this is why I want to just engage with you one last issue before we wrap up. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1470.96s)]
*  You say in the book that across Europe, government administered health care systems negotiate down the prices of drugs and [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1474.96s)]
*  treatments. And I cheered when I read that sentence. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1480.44s)]
*  And then you say in America, our fear of socialized medicine has led to huge inefficiencies, you say, in terms of delivering [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1482.8400000000001s)]
*  health care, the scarcity in health care, high cost health care. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1488.8400000000001s)]
*  Totally agree. I cheered again. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  So why don't you make the case for socialized medicine? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1493.68s)]
*  And why do we not see any mention of Medicare for all in the book? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1497.4s)]
*  That would be a way of dealing with scarcity. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1500.04s)]
*  That would be a way of dealing with the huge inefficiencies in the U.S. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1502.04s)]
*  health care system. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1505.1200000000001s)]
*  I believe in a single payer health care system. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1507.68s)]
*  I think that'd be the best path forward. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1510.04s)]
*  But I also want to be realistic. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1511.3999999999999s)]
*  I also want to be politically realistic. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1512.96s)]
*  Right. I mean, a good book has to be focused. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1514.4399999999998s)]
*  A good book has to understand what is the core argument that it's trying to make. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1516.1599999999999s)]
*  We can't make every single argument. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1519.6799999999998s)]
*  We're not talking about every single thing that could possibly be good in any political future. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1520.8799999999999s)]
*  We're trying to make a very clear argument that in many ways, the problems that Democrats face are the result of rules that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1524.8s)]
*  they allow in the systems that they design. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1530.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. That is one very clear, narrow argument of the book. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1532.28s)]
*  When it comes to socialized medicine, I think there are, of course, if you look at the case of Europe, arguments for having a single [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1537.48s)]
*  payer system that is allowed to negotiate prices with the private sector, to drive down prices, especially for the working and lower [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1544.56s)]
*  classes. There's a lot of good arguments for this. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1551.08s)]
*  If you look at the politics of single payer health care, it's incredibly fraught. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1553.88s)]
*  And so rather than write a chapter about the fraught politics of introducing Medicare for all, right, which is a chapter of a [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1559.0s)]
*  different book that I could research and write and represent the arguments for, I think very sincerely, I wanted to focus in my [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1566.68s)]
*  chapter on medical science on the ways in which the value of health care is not just determined by the card that you own, it's [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1573.0s)]
*  determined by all the things that that card buys. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1580.88s)]
*  So people like you, people like me, throughout the Democratic Party in the last few decades, we've been very focused on [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1583.96s)]
*  universalizing health care. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1589.4s)]
*  And again, I think that's a mitzvah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1590.8s)]
*  I want universal health care. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1592.4399999999998s)]
*  But sometimes in our emphasis on focusing on universal care, we think a little bit less on what that universal care actually buys. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1594.24s)]
*  And I think it's really important to have an invention agenda in America that focuses on all the medical technologies and the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1602.6799999999998s)]
*  science that allows that health care card to buy more drugs that extend people's lives. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1610.12s)]
*  So I want us to try much harder to build new medicines for diabetes and inflammation, dementia, Alzheimer's, all certain kinds of [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1616.4s)]
*  cancers. There's a lot of writing about that because that is the supply side of medicine, you could call it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1625.6s)]
*  But just because I'm focusing on that part of the message in this book, I don't want anyone to confuse with my antagonism towards [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1631.36s)]
*  single para health care. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1640.08s)]
*  I absolutely think that in an ideal world, we would have the government offer a health care plan that every single American [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1640.96s)]
*  could automatically. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1650.8s)]
*  Because it would deal with scarcity. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1651.56s)]
*  And I'm glad I gave you the opportunity to clarify that because I haven't heard you say that elsewhere. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1652.68s)]
*  So I appreciate that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1656.24s)]
*  You mentioned earlier about the time machine and Trump. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1657.68s)]
*  I did read this book thinking to myself, I actually felt bad for you guys. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1659.88s)]
*  I shouldn't feel bad for you guys. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1663.76s)]
*  It's a best selling book. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1664.56s)]
*  You're doing great. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1665.28s)]
*  But I read the book and I thought the timing of this book to be published at the start of the Trump presidency, did it get screwed by [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1666.0s)]
*  the time? Had it come out in 2022 when you wrote your first Atlantic piece or any year of the Biden administration? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1674.36s)]
*  I feel like it would have been much more relevant and urgent to the debate we were having then. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1680.3999999999999s)]
*  But right now, the book comes out where you're talking about high speed rail has failed in California. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1686.28s)]
*  Democrats need to get over their love for bureaucracy at a time when Trump and Musk are literally taking an axe to the entire [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1691.44s)]
*  federal government, getting rid of due process, trying to set up a dictatorship. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1697.72s)]
*  Feels odd to be talking about zoning reform when Trump is rolling back the entire welfare state. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1702.3200000000002s)]
*  One of your critics said it's like bickering over the drapes while an arsonist sets the house on fire. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1708.16s)]
*  Surely you must see that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1714.24s)]
*  You know what? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1717.2800000000002s)]
*  Here's what's funny. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1717.96s)]
*  I remember in September, October last year, Ezra and I were talking about what was going to happen in November. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1720.04s)]
*  And I said, I think this book is better off in a world where Kamala Harris wins the presidency because we can sort of show how [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1725.84s)]
*  the Democratic Party can take its agenda and funnel it toward, massage it toward abundance liberalism. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1736.4s)]
*  And there was this alternative argument that in a weird way, Donald Trump's victory is going to create such a sense of identity [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1744.32s)]
*  crisis for the Democratic Party that any book that offers a kind of prescription of the Democratic Party is going to feel like [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1750.9199999999998s)]
*  medicine for the political disease of that moment. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1758.6799999999998s)]
*  The humble answer here is that I was wrong, I think. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1763.24s)]
*  I think this book is detonating precisely because Donald Trump won. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1766.44s)]
*  And a lot of people are looking for a direction for the Democratic Party. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1772.3200000000002s)]
*  And as you said before, Bernie Sanders is on fire right now. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1776.5600000000002s)]
*  Like the man could he could announce a speech on Wednesday at an Applebee's in rural Iowa. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1781.04s)]
*  And on Thursday, 20,000 people would materialize in the parking lot to hear him speak. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1787.76s)]
*  Clearly, there's an enormous demand for that message, for a message that focuses on anti-capitalism and billionaires and oligarchy. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1792.0s)]
*  We have a subtly and sometimes not subtly distinct message and not humbly, I would say, not so humbly. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1800.8000000000002s)]
*  It's also detonating. Yes, it's not just. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1808.72s)]
*  You don't have to be humble about that. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1812.16s)]
*  You're on the show because I wanted to have this discussion because the book is definitely detonating and we've gone over time. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1814.52s)]
*  So I appreciate you taking time out for me. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1819.64s)]
*  Your book focuses. Last question. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1821.44s)]
*  Your book focuses on quote, the pathologies of the broad left. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1822.88s)]
*  You write that you don't see yourselves as effective messengers to the right. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1826.6000000000001s)]
*  I wonder we're more than three months into this disastrous Trump second term. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1830.4s)]
*  Do you think there might be an appetite growing among Republican voters or at least swing voters for an abundance agenda? [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1834.3200000000002s)]
*  One thing that's been really shocking to me is just how many people from the orphaned center, right, have been interested in talking about these ideas. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1841.0800000000002s)]
*  Right. And there's a way in which this book was not designed for them. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1848.3200000000002s)]
*  We were writing this book for liberals. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1851.3600000000001s)]
*  We said, as you quoted in the introduction, that this is a book by two progressives for the progressive movement. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  But it's interesting because, you know, I think in 2015, there were sort of two Republican parties that were at war with each other. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1859.0s)]
*  There was MAGA and there was like the Romney center, right. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1864.2s)]
*  And I think that Donald Trump basically ate the Romney center, right, and skinned it wearing it as a hat. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1867.4s)]
*  And a lot of people who kind of fashion themselves as Romney Republicans feel like there's nowhere to be. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1871.84s)]
*  I'm not suggesting I know this is going to be clipped in a way that makes it seem like I'm saying something like that. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1876.72s)]
*  I otherwise don't mean I am not suggesting that this book was designed to be a kind of house for Romney Republicans to move into. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1881.24s)]
*  That said, it's just been striking and unambiguous how many folks who I think might have previously defined themselves as center right have said, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1888.5600000000002s)]
*  here's the beginning of a kind of unapologetically liberal movement that talks about egalitarianism and climate change that I could imagine being a part of. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1897.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think you'd agree that one thing that the Democratic Party has to do right now is grow. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1906.24s)]
*  We have to find a way to get beyond the situation where we are losing the popular vote to an illiberal authoritarian who's taken over the right. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1910.3200000000002s)]
*  We have to find a way to grow the tent. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1918.16s)]
*  And so my hope is that, yes, while this book is fostering, not fostering, but engaged in a debate on the left about exactly the future Democratic Party, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1921.0s)]
*  it is, I think, to be fair, also opening a little side door to some disaffected Romney Republicans who are trying to find a new home. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1929.88s)]
*  It's not written for them. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1937.4s)]
*  The principal purpose of this book is not to welcome Republicans to the Democratic Party. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1939.0s)]
*  I do want to be clear. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1943.16s)]
*  That said, it has been a side effect and it's a side effect worth accepting and even mildly cheering because at some point parties who are the minority have to become the majority. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1944.56s)]
*  And there's no path away from growth for that. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTC5jKpYYNU&t=1953.48s)]
