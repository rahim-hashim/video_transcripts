Video Description: “As citizens of democracies, we will be primarily concerned with situations where our own governments…our own political classes, our media classes are complicit. And that is what is going to outrage us long before we get outraged about what is happening in East Timor or Myanmar.”

That’s just one reason Indian Author Pankaj Mishra has spent much of the past year advocating against Israel’s war on Gaza – the subject of his new book, The World After Gaza: A History. Mishra joins Mehdi Hasan to talk about Palestine, censorship, and more. They discuss colonialism, the suppression of Pro-Palestine student protesters, and the parallels between Israel and India - specifically in relation to what India is doing in Kashmir.

# How to Confront Oppression in Gaza, India, and Beyond
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [March 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E)
*  What does the world look like after a genocide that's taken place in front of our eyes? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=0.0s)]
*  What does the world look like after Gaza? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=5.0s)]
*  The acclaimed essayist, historian and author, Pankaj Mishra, has tried to answer that question in his new book [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=8.0s)]
*  by taking us back into the past century of Israeli militarism, American imperialism, Western colonialism, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=14.0s)]
*  the Holocaust and its aftermath, and every type of supremacy from white to Jewish to Hindu. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=20.0s)]
*  The book is called The World After Gaza and it's out now and the author joins us now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=27.0s)]
*  Pankaj Mishra, thank you for joining me on Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=32.0s)]
*  Thank you Mehdi. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=34.0s)]
*  So, in the beginning of your book, you talk about your quote, indebtedness to Jewish thinkers, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=35.0s)]
*  and how for so long, despite seeing the blatant oppression of the Palestinians, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=41.0s)]
*  it was hard for you to quote, resist the Zionist logic. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=44.0s)]
*  So I'm curious Pankaj, how did you, someone who was born, raised, educated in India, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=48.0s)]
*  how did you come to this issue of Palestine, of Gaza, and end up taking a stance that many would say is provocative, contentious? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=54.0s)]
*  Well, it was a tortuous journey in the sense that I grew up in a family of Hindu nationalists [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=62.0s)]
*  who were always extremely sympathetic to Zionism. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=68.0s)]
*  They were also sympathetic to Nazism at the same time, which is interesting in its own way, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=72.0s)]
*  but I think that broadly speaking, they were sympathetic to the idea of a very strong sense of nationality. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=78.0s)]
*  And they thought that Israel had cultivated that successfully and was a strong militaristic state [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=85.0s)]
*  that sponsored a very, very strong sense of belonging among its citizens. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=93.0s)]
*  And that's something we in India should emulate. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=99.0s)]
*  So I grew up essentially thinking of Israeli military heroes as people that we should be emulating in India. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=103.0s)]
*  And then of course, I came into contact with Palestinian students at university. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=111.0s)]
*  And then your view starts to change. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=115.0s)]
*  My view started to change, and obviously I started to read a lot more in the history of Palestine, of the Middle East broadly, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=117.0s)]
*  and came to realize that this was a far more complicated issue than I had childishly imagined. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=126.0s)]
*  And it's of course not just Israel that looms large in the imagination of nationalists and supporters of the Jewish state, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=132.0s)]
*  but also the Holocaust. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=139.0s)]
*  And your book really centers around how Israel in the West remembers the Holocaust, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=141.0s)]
*  which you say has now been weaponized against opponents of Israel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=145.0s)]
*  Is it your view that Israel and its allies abroad have misunderstood the Holocaust, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=150.0s)]
*  have taken a superficial understanding of the lessons of the Holocaust, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=156.0s)]
*  or that they're just cynically using it as a shield? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=160.0s)]
*  Well, I think the people who first pointed to the cynical exploitation of the Holocaust were the survivors of the Holocaust. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=163.0s)]
*  They could see very clearly from the 50s, 60s onwards. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=171.0s)]
*  These are people who had struggled to make their experience resonate for people to listen to them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=175.0s)]
*  They really struggled for audiences back in the 50s and 60s. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=181.0s)]
*  Again, this is a point, it's really important to make that the Holocaust was not institutionalized in so many national cultures. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=184.0s)]
*  It was much later. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=192.0s)]
*  Post-67 war. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=193.0s)]
*  Post-67, a little bit before that, but then it was a very deliberate construction. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=194.0s)]
*  And the survivors of the Holocaust were shocked, and these are people I write about in my book, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=200.0s)]
*  at the way the state of Israel had appropriated that memory and turned it into the service of a militant expansionist project. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=205.0s)]
*  You also write in the book about how when you first tried to write about Israel decades ago, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=214.0s)]
*  you were quickly met with a lot of resistance from publications that otherwise would publish you happily. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=218.0s)]
*  And you quickly noticed that, quote, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=223.0s)]
*  And actually last year you kind of witnessed that firsthand because you write this essay in the London Review of Books about the Shoah after the Shoah after the Holocaust, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=224.0s)]
*  the Shoah after Gaza. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=242.0s)]
*  The Barbican was supposed to host a lecture by you, and I believe they then pulled out. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=244.0s)]
*  Did they pull out voluntarily? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=248.0s)]
*  Were they put under pressure to pull out? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=251.0s)]
*  What was your reaction to that whole episode? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=252.0s)]
*  I'm actually quite sure what happened there at the Barbican, but they certainly pulled out at the last moment, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=254.0s)]
*  fearing that they might also attract the same malicious charge of anti-Semitism. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=261.0s)]
*  This is a fear that governs a lot of institutions, a lot of individuals, what they can say about the subject. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=266.0s)]
*  And of course, we know that this accusation has been vulgarized and cheapened dangerously to the point where we are kind of, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=272.0s)]
*  for a lot of people, anti-Semitism is just something that is, the charge of anti-Semitism is just used to silence critics. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=281.0s)]
*  But this is something you just have to prepare yourself for when you write about this subject. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=289.0s)]
*  And there are just a whole lot of taboos around this subject, and if you try to break them, you will be stigmatized. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=294.0s)]
*  No question. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=301.0s)]
*  But you went into both the LRB essay and the book that's come out of it with eyes wide open that this charge would be used against you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=302.0s)]
*  Look, Mendy, I mean, I think we've lived through like 15 months of extreme violence, accompanied by mendacity, deception on the part of Israel supporters. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=309.0s)]
*  I think this is something you can't really fear anymore. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=321.0s)]
*  We've seen horrific things in the last 15 months. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=325.0s)]
*  There is so much more to fear at this point than the charge of anti-Semitism. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=328.0s)]
*  After your article was published in the LRB and after that lecture was given, you received a lot of heat, including from the Jewish Chronicle here in the UK. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=333.0s)]
*  Specifically for writing that Israel believes it, quote, has the right to slaughter 13,000 children, not only as a matter of self-defense, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=341.0s)]
*  but because it is a state born out of the Shoah, out of the Holocaust. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=348.0s)]
*  What do you say to your critics who say, well, that's a very shallow understanding of Israel and the Holocaust. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=352.0s)]
*  It's offensive. It's anti-Semitic to say that Israel wants to kill kids because Jews endured a genocide. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=358.0s)]
*  And they also attack you for not talking more about Hamas and what happened on October the 7th. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=364.0s)]
*  How do you respond to critics like that? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=369.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I don't think Israel wants to kill children, but I think it's indifferent to the widespread killing of children during its military campaigns. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=371.0s)]
*  So that's, you know, I don't think there's sort of deliberate intention there to kill thousands of children. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=380.0s)]
*  And the figure has been exceeded. The 13,000 figure was that was that was last year. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=386.0s)]
*  You know, I think there's a lot of this subject about Hamas generates a lot more heat than light. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=391.0s)]
*  If you know the history of anti-colonial movements, you know that there are several phases, even within the Palestinian sort of resistance, as it were, since the late 40s. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=399.0s)]
*  You've had the PLO, which was once deemed a terrorist organization. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=409.0s)]
*  Then, of course, it was accepted into the mainstream and it up ruling the West Bank. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=413.0s)]
*  And likewise with Hamas, even Hamas has gone through several different phases. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=418.0s)]
*  It was once completely dedicated to the eradication of Israel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=423.0s)]
*  They also then changed. They dropped the anti-Semitism that was part of their founding charter. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=428.0s)]
*  They accepted a two state solution. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=434.0s)]
*  So, you know, if you're going to only equate people who oppose a colonial occupation with mindless savagery, which is the default position, then you're actually basically not interested in a political solution. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=437.0s)]
*  Yes. But can you do both, Pankaj? Can you say that Hamas of today, weirdly people don't realize this, according to their own updated charter, say they're in favor of a Huttner, a long term truce. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=452.0s)]
*  They're willing to accept a Palestinian state on 67 lines if that's what the people want, they say. Netanyahu doesn't accept that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=464.0s)]
*  So they're more moderate than Netanyahu. But on the other hand, on October the 7th, they did carry out acts of extreme barbarism, cruelty, war crimes, according to most human rights groups. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=470.0s)]
*  You can say both. Absolutely you can. And there's no question they committed horrific war crimes on October 7th, killing hundreds of civilians, many, many more civilians than soldiers. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=478.0s)]
*  I mean, nobody is really no sensible person is denying that. But we also have to look at what is what was happening before October 7th. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=489.0s)]
*  Yes, agreed. Another charge that's put it, I'd love to hear your response. People say, well, Pankaj Mishra is an Indian born writer living in the UK, writes about all sorts of things. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=498.0s)]
*  But when it comes to geopolitics, obsessed with the Middle East, why is he writing a book about Gaza? Why is he not writing about Sudan or Xinjiang or Kashmir? Why Gaza? Why the attention on Gaza? What do you say to that? You hear that a lot. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=511.0s)]
*  Well, I would say that they actually haven't read a lot of what I've written. You know, I've spent more time writing about Kashmir than I have writing about the Middle East. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=523.0s)]
*  I've spent more time writing about Hindu nationalism in India, Islamic fundamentalism in Pakistan or Afghanistan or Indonesia, Tibet. I can just keep on naming those places. They clearly haven't read what I've written. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=532.0s)]
*  Yes. What aboutism? What about all these other conflicts? Not this one. But there is a sense, and I think you said this at the Jaipur Festival recently where you were talking about your book, where we talk about Gaza more than Sudan or more than Xinjiang. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=547.0s)]
*  Certainly because we're complicit in what's happening in Gaza. Of course we are. I mean, that's something, you know, actually this book is largely about is the levels of complicity. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=561.0s)]
*  There are so many, obviously there's so many conflict zones around the world where horrific atrocities as we speak are being carried out. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=572.0s)]
*  But, you know, as citizens of democracies, we will be primarily concerned with situations where our own governments, where our own political classes, our media classes are complicit. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=581.0s)]
*  And that is what is going to outrage us long before we get outraged about, you know, what is happening in East Timor or Myanmar for that matter. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=594.0s)]
*  That's a very good point. I was just thinking as you were talking about while you wrote this book, you've written lots of books, acclaimed books, and you've done lots of media and people invite you into, you know, elite publications to write. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=604.0s)]
*  Have you felt a different response to this book? Have you felt that the phone is ringing less, people want to talk to you less about this book? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=615.0s)]
*  I'd be very curious to see how this book is received. It might be received with a thunderous silence. I'm not ruling that out. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=621.0s)]
*  Okay. Well, it doesn't deserve a thunderous silence. It's an excellent book. I encourage everyone to get their copy. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=629.0s)]
*  In the book, you draw a lot of connections between the rise in authoritarianism, nationalism, and support for Israel. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=634.0s)]
*  Writing the quote, some of the most fervent upholders of the memory of the Shoah and defenders of Israel are also Europe's and America's most authoritarian, often anti-Semitic politicians, movements, and personalities. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=641.0s)]
*  In your view, what is it that draws a Victor Orban or a Marine Le Pen to Israel? Is it that they see it as a bulwark against the Muslim hordes? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=653.0s)]
*  Or is it that they see it as a way of inoculating themselves from the charge of anti-Semitism? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=664.0s)]
*  A lot of anti-Semites, when they're accused of anti-Semitism, they say, I'm not anti-Semitic. I love Israel. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=669.0s)]
*  Immediately, that's their first response, as if that makes you immune from anti-Semitism. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=674.0s)]
*  What do you think draws these kind of far-right authoritarians to Israel? I mean, Israel is run by a far-right authoritarian, Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=678.0s)]
*  I think all of those factors that you mentioned, of course, trying to dodge the charge of anti-Semitism by, like Elon Musk classically, visiting Auschwitz, hanging out with Netanyahu, and then going to Israel. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=684.0s)]
*  But I think there's something more disturbing going on, and it's now becoming clearer and clearer. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=696.0s)]
*  The impunity with which Israel acts is a great moral and emotional boost for far-right authoritarians around the world. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=702.0s)]
*  They identify Israel now increasingly with a culture of impunity that they would like, really, to import in their own societies, in their own countries. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=712.0s)]
*  And that's something that now attracts all kinds of people, especially the far-right authoritarians, who also want to create little bonfires of international norms of morality in their own societies. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=722.0s)]
*  You have MAGA politicians, Trumpists in America, saying, well, they built a wall. Israel built a wall. Why can't we build a wall? Even that has borrowed the language of that. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=735.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And all these sort of appointments that Trump has made recently, getting this guy, the sort of defense secretary, completely unqualified. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=744.0s)]
*  I mean, quite the opposite. You cannot imagine a more unsuitable candidate for that role. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=752.0s)]
*  But when you look at the Israeli sort of guy who was in charge of the police there, again, we see sort of people... [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=756.0s)]
*  Parallels. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=767.0s)]
*  There are parallels there. People are actually literally modeling themselves on the state of Israel. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=768.0s)]
*  Very good point. Depressing point. You talk about a big part of your journey to advocating for Palestinians was recognizing that they were, quote, people who looked like me. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=772.0s)]
*  You refer to India's own struggle against British colonials within India, writing that the Palestinians, quote, now endured a nightmare that I and my own ancestors had put behind us. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=781.0s)]
*  Now, of course, that's not a perspective shared by the leaders of India today. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=792.0s)]
*  We talked about the Hindu nationalists who run India today, the BJP, the RSS, Modi and co. India has gone from being one of the strongest supporters of the Palestinian cause until the early 90s. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=797.0s)]
*  India didn't even recognize, had no diplomatic relations with Israel. Today, Modi hugs Netanyahu and goes for long walks on the beach with him. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=806.0s)]
*  What do you make of that shift? And what does that say about India and how India has changed under Modi that it's so close to Israel today? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=814.0s)]
*  You know, I think, as I said, you know, in my childhood, there were lots of people, but they were they were a tiny minority who wanted Israel to be a model for for Indian nationalism, for Hindu. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=823.0s)]
*  The majority was very pro-Palestinian. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=832.0s)]
*  The majority. But, you know, I would still say, look, the image projected by the Indian government of a very close alliance with Israel can be extremely misleading. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=833.0s)]
*  There are still large pockets within the Indian population of pro-Palestinian sentiment and emotion there. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=844.0s)]
*  So I think regardless of what the government says or thinks, and, you know, actually, the government has been no answer in its position too lately because it, you know, it realizes that it needs to keep all these other countries on board as well. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=853.0s)]
*  It can't put its eggs in just this one basket here. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=865.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I think there is, you know, obviously the experience of colonialism and the way we talk about colonialism in large parts of Asia and Africa that obviously determines how we respond to this situation. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=869.0s)]
*  Palestine is very much a case of postponed, delayed, criminally postponed decolonization. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=886.0s)]
*  And that's something that immediately comes to mind when you look at it from the perspective of place like India or any any country in Asia and Africa. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=892.0s)]
*  In the book, you talk about India's politics, the formation of national identity, for example, has come to mimic Israel, as you say. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=899.0s)]
*  That said, do you see parallels between what Israel has done to Gaza and what India is doing in Kashmir? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=906.0s)]
*  I think, you know, a lot of states after essentially gaining their independence from European empires have had a lot of trouble with their minorities. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=914.0s)]
*  How to accommodate them in this sort of new nation state? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=925.0s)]
*  Obviously, for many, many countries, India was one of them once upon a time, Indonesia, offering a multicultural, a multinational polity where all citizens have equal rights, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=928.0s)]
*  regardless of their ethnic, racial, religious ancestry. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=941.0s)]
*  That was a solution favored by so many, you know, post-colonial Asian, Asian and African countries. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=946.0s)]
*  If you move against, if you move away from that solution and you say, no, it's the Hindu majority or the Jewish majority, that's going to decide who gets to be a citizen. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=951.0s)]
*  Then obviously you're going to have a very serious problem. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=963.0s)]
*  Obviously, the Israeli-Palestinian case is very different from Kashmir. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=967.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I think what we look at is essentially a state, a newly sovereign state, unable to deal with problems of dispossession, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=971.0s)]
*  the problems that emerged during the creation of these states and resorting to really naked violence to solve these problems. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=983.0s)]
*  So I think there are sort of these parallels between not just between Israel and India, but also various other post-colonial states, including Indonesia, for that matter. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=994.0s)]
*  In the end of the book, you paint a pretty dismal picture for Palestine, writing that Israel will, quote, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1002.0s)]
*  most likely succeed in ethnic cleansing Gaza and the West Bank as well. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1006.0s)]
*  And you attribute that partly, obviously, to the reelection of Donald Trump, who's now said his plan for Gaza is clean out the whole thing, I think is the phrase he used. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1011.0s)]
*  I have to ask, with the Biden administration being knee deep in this genocide, complicit in this genocide, what do you make of what happened in the U.S. last year? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1018.0s)]
*  How closely were you following the election and the choice that was put before progressives, leftists, young voters, ethnic minorities, Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1029.0s)]
*  to choose between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, who succeeded him, who are complicit in an ongoing genocide, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1038.0s)]
*  or Donald Trump, who in some ways is going to be much worse for the region, although he now pretends to have gotten the ceasefire, does not really ceasefire. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1046.0s)]
*  But now he's talking about ethnic cleansing as well. It puts Americans in a real bind there when that's the choice on offer when it comes to Gaza. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1053.0s)]
*  It was an unpalatable, unpalatable choice. You know, I think this idea that there is this lesser evil out there and it's better to choose it. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1061.0s)]
*  When you know there is no such thing as a lesser evil, it was an impossible choice to make. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1069.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, you can't blame people for sitting out the election or voting for Donald Trump because this great despair and hopelessness that descended upon large parts of the American population, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1075.0s)]
*  they really had no choice except to hope for something different, hope for something better. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1090.0s)]
*  But when you're looking at Gaza or if you're looking at the Middle East more broadly and you're looking at Western imperialism, you don't think there is a lesser evil? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1096.0s)]
*  You don't think one of the two parties is more belligerent, more aggressive, more racist? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1102.0s)]
*  No question. No question. But, you know, I think if that party stands and large, you know, not just not just sort of, you know, a few people within the party, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1107.0s)]
*  but there is a very broad support within that party for an ongoing genocide, as you put it. I mean, what kind of choice does that offer? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1116.0s)]
*  Yeah, morally it's very difficult. It is extremely difficult. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1125.0s)]
*  Throughout the book you speak very highly of the students who protested the war in Gaza last year. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1127.0s)]
*  You say, quote, a whole generation of young people in the West was pushed into moral adulthood by the words and actions and inaction of its elders in politics and journalism, well put. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1131.0s)]
*  And of course, those student protests were demonised, assaulted, arrested, doxxed. Some of them had their careers, you know, future careers wrecked. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1142.0s)]
*  What do you think student protest and the reaction to it told us about America and the West's supposed commitment to free speech? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1152.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, you know, I think the suppression of those protests and again the way in which, you know, newspapers, mainstream newspapers, [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1161.0s)]
*  mainstream politicians collaborated in demonising those student protesters and then, you know, obviously kind of crushing them, them, them extremely brutally. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1171.0s)]
*  That was one of the most horrific events of the last year. I mean, you know, obviously in addition to what was going on in Gaza itself. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1181.0s)]
*  But I still think that those student protesters, even though they were crushed and silenced, offered us a modest hope. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1189.0s)]
*  The possibility that, you know, after the failures, catastrophic failures of the elders, and I include people like ourselves, you know, people who have been in the media for some time and, you know, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1198.0s)]
*  mainstream policy, we can't really expect too much from them at this point. But we have to keep our hopes alive in this younger generation that has lived through a live stream genocide and has discovered a moral sense, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1210.0s)]
*  you know, that it's really important to separate right from wrong and that, you know, you cannot be, you should not let yourself be corrupted by your professional engagements, by your careers. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1222.0s)]
*  That there is something about having a clear cut moral position on these issues. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1236.0s)]
*  And not just a moral position, but political power, right? The fact that these people were seen as a threat by the establishment, the reason they crack down so viciously is because they recognize that this is real. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1242.0s)]
*  This is a threat to the established order, to the way we do business, to our children. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1253.0s)]
*  A lot of these people in power like those are our kids being brainwashed on campus. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1257.0s)]
*  And now they're cracking down with this new definition, not new, but they're trying, newly trying to empower the old IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, which is seen as a way of silencing criticism of Israel. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1261.0s)]
*  Some of the definitions of anti-Semitism that the IHRA uses, which is, for example, calling Israel a racist endeavor, is seen as evidence of anti-Semitism. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1274.0s)]
*  A lot of Jewish scholars have come out against it. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1282.0s)]
*  But last month, Harvard University decided to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism after they settled a case with a Jewish student. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1285.0s)]
*  How worried are you about censorship? You are someone who has been in academia, who writes, who does long form journalism, writes books, written a book on Gaza. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1293.0s)]
*  Are we looking at a new era of censorship in the West? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1301.0s)]
*  Oh, definitely. I think as a writer, as a broadcaster, I think you have to be now constantly aware of a struggle ahead against all kinds of oppressive constraints. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1305.0s)]
*  And the possibility of being punished very severely, of being deplatformed, I mean, that has already happened to many people we know. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1316.0s)]
*  And so it's getting worse and worse, no question about it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1324.0s)]
*  But you have to keep doing what you believe in. You know, you have to keep you have to keep talking about these things wherever, wherever, wherever possible. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1328.0s)]
*  And speaking up on Gaza, it's not the first time you've had backlash. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1336.0s)]
*  In 2011, you got into a spat with the right wing historian Neil Ferguson after writing an article comparing him to Tom Buchanan from The Great Gatsby, which he called, quote, libelous and dishonest. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1341.0s)]
*  In 2018, you wrote a piece about Jordan Peterson, to which he responded by calling you a quite racist son of a bitch and saying he would slap you. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1353.0s)]
*  I got to ask Pankaj, when you write these pieces about men like Ferguson or Peterson, are you expecting them to respond in such an emotional way? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1363.0s)]
*  Are you poking the bear on purpose? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1373.0s)]
*  Well, it's all actually, you know, I'm actually engaging with what they've written, not with their volatile personalities. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1375.0s)]
*  OK, but you're aware of their volatile personalities. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1381.0s)]
*  I'm not even properly aware of, you know, Jordan Peterson also on social media. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1385.0s)]
*  I'm not on social media. I actually don't know what he's been saying on his YouTube channels and so on or on Twitter. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1389.0s)]
*  I'm actually looking at the stuff he's written and arriving at certain certain conclusions. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1396.0s)]
*  So it's it's sort of extraordinary to me that they would take this so personally instead of actually entering into a conversation, into an argument. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1402.0s)]
*  The people who moan so much about snowflakes tend to be snowflakes themselves. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1409.0s)]
*  Very true. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1412.0s)]
*  Just going back to your book, the end of your book, some might say is a little bit depressing. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1413.0s)]
*  Not only do you say Israel may very well succeed in ethnically cleansing Gaza, but you also take the famous Dr. Kring quote. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1417.0s)]
*  And you say there is already too much evidence that the arc of the moral universe does not bend towards justice. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1426.0s)]
*  What would you say to a student protester who you've praised and said gave us a modicum of hope? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1433.0s)]
*  Student protester who looks at your book, reads your book, says that line and says, all right, then so what's the point? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1438.0s)]
*  What's the point of me protesting? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1444.0s)]
*  No, I think even if you assume that there is no justice ultimately, you still have to fight for it. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1446.0s)]
*  And you know, life essentially consists of that struggle. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1453.0s)]
*  You actually, you know, in a way, find a meaning in existence by striving for justice. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1457.0s)]
*  Even if you don't think you'll be successful. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1463.0s)]
*  Even if you don't think you're going to get it, it's important to strive for it. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1465.0s)]
*  And that's how you make your life meaningful and the lives of the people around you. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1469.0s)]
*  Well said. Pankaj Mishra. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ8OoKYuB4E&t=1473.0s)]
