# Mehdi CHALLENGES Trump Campaign Surrogate on Elon Musk and Policy Flip Flops
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [January 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc)
*  You used to think Trump was unfit for office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=0.0s)]
*  You called him absurd. You called him unserious. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2.04s)]
*  Just like Vice President Vance and others, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=4.32s)]
*  President said... [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  No, I'm not Ben Benidhi. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=7.68s)]
*  ...have come to see the record and have come to see the man. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=8.96s)]
*  Trump lied, Adolfo, in order to demonize immigrants like you and me. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Let me tell you something. No, he's not talking about you and me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Trump branded himself as the person who would, quote, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=17.52s)]
*  drain the swamp in D.C. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=19.68s)]
*  Rather than draining the swamp, he is filling it with alligators, is he not? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=21.68s)]
*  He's listening to his friends, some of them will happen to be lobbyists. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=25.44s)]
*  You're confronting with a Trump statement. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=28.16s)]
*  You try and find a way to spin it, reinterpret it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=29.68s)]
*  But it's... [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=32.0s)]
*  Because the facts are clear. He lied. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=32.4s)]
*  It's when I take statements that President Biden or others have said... [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=34.24s)]
*  I don't care about Joe Biden. He's gone in two weeks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=37.28s)]
*  He's gone. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=39.44s)]
*  Joe Biden lies. He lies about Gaza. He lies about lots of things. We agree. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=40.0s)]
*  What about Trump's lie now? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=42.88s)]
*  Is it President Musk and Vice President Trump? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=44.32s)]
*  All these loaded questions, loaded comments. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=46.88s)]
*  Trump is... Trump... I just gave you a blunt quote. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=48.96s)]
*  You're unfiltered. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=50.88s)]
*  On Monday, the United States Congress certified the 2024 presidential election results and Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=51.52s)]
*  The process was peaceful, smooth and, well, a very different picture to what we saw four years ago. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=58.32s)]
*  When Donald Trump incited a full-blown insurrection, inspiring a mob of his armed supporters to storm the Capitol. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=64.72s)]
*  After, he and his cronies had spent months peddling lies about the president's lies. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=71.36s)]
*  And fraudulent votes following his loss to Joe Biden. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=78.16s)]
*  But when it comes to the results of the 2024 election, Trump has had seemingly no complaints about that rampant voter fraud he claims we saw in 2020. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=80.4s)]
*  No, instead, Trump was more than happy to watch Kamala Harris certify the Electoral College results. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=88.4s)]
*  Something his supporters almost killed Vice President Mike Pence for doing four years ago. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=94.4s)]
*  And now, with less than two weeks until his inauguration, Trump is already setting the scene for a term bound to be even more hypocritical and reckless than the first. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=101.36s)]
*  Not only has he nominated wrestling executives and anti-vaxxers to his administration, but he's also got billionaire Elon Musk setting his agenda. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  With Musk seemingly having convinced Trump to do a U-turn on legal immigration and even risking his life. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  Now, I've met a lot of people who will go to bat for Trump, but joining me now is perhaps one of his fiercest defenders, Adolfo Franco, who I debated on Al Jazeera's head-to-head just a few months ago. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=124.32s)]
*  Adolfo is a long-time Republican strategist who even worked for the late John McCain, but was most recently an official spokesperson for the Trump 2024 presidential campaign. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=132.32s)]
*  Adolfo Franco, thank you for joining us. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=140.32s)]
*  Thank you, Eddie. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=142.32s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=144.32s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=147.28s)]
*  Happy New Year. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=149.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=151.28s)]
*  The New Year started politically Monday, January the 6th. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=153.28s)]
*  This week, Congress did its constitutional duty. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=155.28s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris did her duty and certified the Electoral College victory for your man, Donald Trump. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=157.28s)]
*  Four years ago, then President Trump, insisted the election was rigged, urged his followers, many of whom were armed, to go to the Capitol and vote for Trump. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=163.28s)]
*  Which they did, injuring over 100 police officers, causing multiple deaths that day. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=172.24s)]
*  Why didn't he do that again this year? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=178.24s)]
*  Is it because he lost in 2020 and he won in 2024? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=180.24s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=184.24s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=186.24s)]
*  I think President Trump feels very, very strongly that the 2020 election was indeed irregular at a minimum. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=188.24s)]
*  Because he lost, but when he wins, it's not irregular. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=194.24s)]
*  No, no, I think it's a very different story. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=196.24s)]
*  I don't think anyone on any side believed this year, Mehdi, that the election was close, so they were contested. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=199.20000000000002s)]
*  This was a very close election in 2020. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  There were irregularities, even Democrats' irregularities. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  But of course you're not going to say when you have 312 electoral votes that you've won that the election, that you haven't won the election. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, Biden, I think, had 307. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  So they both pretty similar. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  And he actually had a bigger popular vote margin. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=223.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I don't think you want us to vote for Trump. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't think you want us to believe that when Donald Trump was the sitting president of the United States, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=228.16s)]
*  controlled the DOJ, controlled the armed forces, controlled the FBI, controlled the cyber security agency, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=232.16s)]
*  the Democrats somehow, without any power, managed to rig the elections against him. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=236.16s)]
*  But when the Democrats actually controlled the White House and the DOJ and the FBI and the quote unquote deep state last year, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=242.16s)]
*  they were unable to rig the elections to keep themselves in power. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=248.16s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=252.16s)]
*  Well, it does make sense. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=254.16s)]
*  But the elections are handled at the state and local level. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=257.12s)]
*  They're not handled at the federal level. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=259.12s)]
*  The elections in Georgia and Pennsylvania, the irregularities... [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=261.12s)]
*  Well, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin all have Democratic governors. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=263.12s)]
*  Why didn't they rig it this year? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=267.12s)]
*  But were the elections are local, such as in areas, jurisdictions like Philadelphia or Atlanta and these areas, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=269.12s)]
*  these are not federal areas. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=275.12s)]
*  These are areas controlled. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=277.12s)]
*  There's a long history of our country, whether you like it or not, called Democratic Party machines. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=279.12s)]
*  There were dailies in Chicago. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=284.08s)]
*  Yes, and the Democrats now run the White House, but they couldn't keep themselves in office. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=286.08s)]
*  No, it isn't strange, because it is local. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=290.08s)]
*  These are local elections and these were the local... [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=292.08s)]
*  And they still control all those places locally. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=294.08s)]
*  It's interesting you should mention Philadelphia. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=296.08s)]
*  On election day last November... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=298.08s)]
*  You know, can I answer the question? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=300.08s)]
*  The president said it. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=302.08s)]
*  Too big to be rigged. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=304.08s)]
*  I don't disagree... [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=306.08s)]
*  Well, it was a narrower victory than Joe Biden. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=308.08s)]
*  I don't disagree. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=310.08s)]
*  I disagree when the election is very, very large. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  This was a very close election. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  He won by one of the smallest popular votes in American history. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  But when you distributed, there wasn't 10,000 votes difference. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=321.03999999999996s)]
*  Oh, actually, the three swing states... [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  It was much larger. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  It was over 50,000 in Pennsylvania alone. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  The three swing states had 133,000 votes or something gone the other way for Harris. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  She had a win president now. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, but that's a larger margin than it was in 2020. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=339.03999999999996s)]
*  You mentioned Philadelphia. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=342.0s)]
*  On election day last November, Trump was talking about voter fraud. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=344.0s)]
*  On election day. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=346.0s)]
*  He was very specific. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=348.0s)]
*  He talked about there being, quote, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=350.0s)]
*  massive cheating in the key swing state of Pennsylvania. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=352.0s)]
*  As soon as he won Pennsylvania and won the election, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=354.0s)]
*  we didn't hear any more about massive cheating. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=356.0s)]
*  What happened to it? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=358.0s)]
*  Or is there only voter fraud when Trump thinks he's about to lose? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=360.0s)]
*  I don't believe that for a moment. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=362.0s)]
*  I do believe, and Republican pollsters, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=364.0s)]
*  even before President Trump have said that the margin [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=366.0s)]
*  in many of these large Democratic cities, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=368.0s)]
*  like in Baltimore, be they Philadelphia, that there is fraud. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=370.96s)]
*  The question, the answer again, is too big to be rigged. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=372.96s)]
*  There were rule votes, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=374.96s)]
*  there was a margin that was larger in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=376.96s)]
*  So there was massive cheating in Pennsylvania? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=378.96s)]
*  There was cheating in Pennsylvania. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=380.96s)]
*  In 2024? In 2024. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=382.96s)]
*  You just started the interview saying this was a fair election. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=384.96s)]
*  Well, fair in this way. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=386.96s)]
*  I said it was too big to be rigged. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=388.96s)]
*  You said that later. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=390.96s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=392.96s)]
*  By the way, President Trump also used those words. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=394.96s)]
*  So you have now said, everyone heard you say [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=396.96s)]
*  that there was fraud in the regularities in every election. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=398.96s)]
*  So on that basis, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=400.96s)]
*  if Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=402.96s)]
*  had said that she had heard there was massive cheating [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=404.96s)]
*  from Adolfo Franco and Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=406.96s)]
*  and she rejected the Trump state of electors [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=408.96s)]
*  from Pennsylvania, would you have been okay with that? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=410.96s)]
*  Would you have supported her power to do that? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=412.96s)]
*  And maybe declare herself president on Monday. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=414.96s)]
*  I'll tell you, the answer to that is two things. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=416.96s)]
*  Democrats have done that in 2020. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=418.96s)]
*  That's not what I asked. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=420.96s)]
*  Actually, they've never done that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=422.96s)]
*  Al Gore lost in 2000. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=424.96s)]
*  Many would say he won. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=426.96s)]
*  But handed over power without insurrection. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=428.96s)]
*  Not his to handle, not mine. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=430.96s)]
*  Well, according to Donald Trump's theory, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=432.96s)]
*  the Vice President gets to decide. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=434.96s)]
*  So could Kamala Harris on Monday have declared herself president [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=436.96s)]
*  on the basis of massive cheating in Pennsylvania? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=438.96s)]
*  She could have declared herself anything. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=440.96s)]
*  You would have supported that. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=442.96s)]
*  Why not? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=444.96s)]
*  Because I don't think the margins were close enough [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=446.96s)]
*  to justify a contest. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=448.96s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=450.96s)]
*  That's not what Donald Trump said at the time. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=452.96s)]
*  What will you go on? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=454.96s)]
*  Adolfo, you can't go on about margins. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=456.96s)]
*  In 2000, in 2004, in 2016, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=458.96s)]
*  Democratic members of Congress [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=460.96s)]
*  contested the results of the elections [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=462.96s)]
*  when Republicans won. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=464.96s)]
*  They didn't try to overturn the election result, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=466.96s)]
*  nor did the candidate. Hillary Clinton did not, Al Gore did not. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=468.96s)]
*  I am talking about members of Congress [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=470.96s)]
*  who actually vote for certification. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=472.96s)]
*  They're not the candidates. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=474.96s)]
*  I'm asking about the VP only. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=476.96s)]
*  The Vice President has the power to reject [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=478.96s)]
*  fraudulently chosen electors. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=480.96s)]
*  He said on January 5, he didn't add your little caveat [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=482.96s)]
*  of how big or small the result. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=484.96s)]
*  He said the Vice President has the power. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=486.96s)]
*  Now, I don't agree with him. You do. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=488.96s)]
*  So I'm asking, if Kamala Harris said on Monday [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=490.96s)]
*  Adolfo Franco and Donald Trump said massive cheating in Pennsylvania, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=492.96s)]
*  I reject the electors from Pennsylvania. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=494.96s)]
*  You support her power to do that. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=496.96s)]
*  I think she would have had a basis to do that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=498.96s)]
*  had the election been closer. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=500.96s)]
*  That's not the criteria. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=502.96s)]
*  The criteria, according to John Eastman, Trump's lawyer, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=504.96s)]
*  was that the Vice President is the ultimate arbiter. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=506.96s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=508.96s)]
*  But it's not the case that the Vice President [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=510.96s)]
*  is the only person who can change that. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=512.96s)]
*  Because it's not the same person [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=514.96s)]
*  who can change the law. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=516.96s)]
*  I mean, it's not the same person who can change the law. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=518.96s)]
*  I mean, it's not the same person who can change the law. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=520.96s)]
*  I'm asking about the VP. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=522.96s)]
*  We have to change the law because of Donald Trump. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=524.96s)]
*  There was no law. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=526.96s)]
*  We had to have clarity on the matter. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=528.96s)]
*  Here's what's so interesting. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=530.96s)]
*  It's not just Trump saying, oh, there's cheating. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=532.96s)]
*  I win. There's no cheating. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=534.96s)]
*  Suddenly, being OK with election results when you win [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=536.96s)]
*  Trump voters said that the election was run fairly. But this time around, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=538.96s)]
*  after their candidate won, the number surged to 93%. How can democracy [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=542.96s)]
*  in America survive, Adolfo, when one party only accepts the result when [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=547.96s)]
*  they win? The other party accepts, Democrats consistently accept when [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=551.96s)]
*  they lose, except when they win. But I have to reject that. Republicans [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=554.96s)]
*  do not simply say because we lost our election. I literally gave you the [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=558.96s)]
*  stats. 21% in 2020, 93%. Because the margins here were such that it was [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=562.96s)]
*  not contestable. But we lost very, very close Senate races and we did not [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=567.96s)]
*  contest them in Wisconsin, in Michigan, and in Nevada. We did not contest [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=575.96s)]
*  those races. You're telling me with a straight face, if Donald Trump had [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=579.96s)]
*  lost... I have to tell you with a straight face. Republicans would have [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=583.96s)]
*  accepted the result. The statement to say, the statement saying that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=586.96s)]
*  Republicans always reject elections when they lose is not true. I said in [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=589.96s)]
*  2020 they didn't. In 2024 they did. Nothing changed between those two [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=593.96s)]
*  elections. I think there were a lot of... The only difference is Trump won. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=598.96s)]
*  The difference is there were serious irregularities in a very, very close race [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=601.96s)]
*  in 2020. You just said there were irregularities in 2024. But the margin [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=605.96s)]
*  is too long. Do I think the regularity was too long? The margin was very narrow [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=608.96s)]
*  in all these states. It was not a narrow margin. What was the margin in Pennsylvania? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=611.96s)]
*  The margin of participation when they won was 50,000 votes. You think that's a [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=615.96s)]
*  big win? That's a large number. That's a large number. That is tiny number. No, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=618.96s)]
*  not 200 million Americans living in Pennsylvania. That is a wide, wide [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=622.96s)]
*  margin. That is why we won the election. What was the margin in 2016 in Michigan [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=626.96s)]
*  when Trump won? The margin in Michigan in 2016 was 10,000. Why did Hillary [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=629.96s)]
*  contest that? Because... There's no consistency to your argument. There is a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=633.96s)]
*  consistency. Did you accept that Hillary should contest? In 2019, what did [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=638.96s)]
*  Hillary say? The election was stolen from me. Did she contest it? I don't [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=642.96s)]
*  know why she didn't contest it. You would have supported her right to do it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=646.96s)]
*  She would have had to... Every viewer watching, sure you say, if the margin [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=649.96s)]
*  is narrow, you get to contest it. She can contest anything. But only [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=653.96s)]
*  Republicans get to contest it. No, she can contest anything she wishes to [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=657.96s)]
*  contest. There's a lot of inconsistency with the Republican Party. There's a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=660.96s)]
*  lot of inconsistency when Democrats now say the election was stolen in 2016. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=663.96s)]
*  They don't say it was stolen. Really? Well, look up... I must have missed it. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=667.96s)]
*  Your researchers did a better job in 2019. Was there an insurrection in [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=672.96s)]
*  January? There was no insurrection in 2020. That's not what Mitch McConnell [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=675.96s)]
*  and Kevin McCarthy said. No, there was a riot, a mob, and certain people [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=680.96s)]
*  should be held accountable. The Senate Republican leader called it an [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=684.96s)]
*  insurrection. I don't care what you call it. I'm just telling you the leader [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=687.96s)]
*  of your party said it was. He can speak for himself. He speaks for your party. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=691.96s)]
*  That's the definition of a leader. He is the leader of the Senate. He is not [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=695.96s)]
*  the leader of the Republican Party. I said he's a leader. But he does not [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=699.96s)]
*  speak for all Republicans. But he is a leader. He's not a random guy. He's a [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=702.96s)]
*  Senate Republican leader. He's not a national leader. Let me be clear to your [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=706.96s)]
*  viewers. Nobody elected Mitch McConnell except the people of Connecticut. No [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=710.96s)]
*  one else did. Kentucky, let's talk about inconsistencies in the Republican [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=714.96s)]
*  Party apart from accepting results that they win and disputing the ones they [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=718.96s)]
*  lose. That's not true. It's literally what we saw. During his first [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=722.96s)]
*  presidential campaign, Trump branded himself as the person who would, quote, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=726.96s)]
*  drain the swamp in D.C. who would get rid of White House and government [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=729.96s)]
*  corruption hilariously. This past election cycle even said, quote, you have [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=732.96s)]
*  to stop listening to lobbyists. And yet since being elected, Trump has tapped a [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=735.96s)]
*  number of long-time lobbyists and put them in key positions in the White [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=740.96s)]
*  House, his cabinet, his administration. Rather than draining the swamp, he is [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=745.96s)]
*  filling it with alligators, is he not, and completely betraying his working [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=749.96s)]
*  class base in the process. No. He's appointing loyalists, and that's the big [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=752.96s)]
*  difference. What people are in the past, when he came in in 2016, I remember [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=757.96s)]
*  when he came in vividly in 2017, is he was dependent and because he was new to [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=761.96s)]
*  Washington, D.C. on the establishment class. That's what he's referring to, a [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=767.96s)]
*  lobbyist. There are people that are lobbyists and so forth that are complete [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=770.96s)]
*  loyalists that he did not bring in in 2016. So people who he has now become [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=773.96s)]
*  acquainted with over the last eight years or had even prior to that. So it [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=779.96s)]
*  doesn't matter if they're lobbyists if he likes them? I don't think he likes [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=783.96s)]
*  them if they're loyal to his agenda. That's what he said to the country. He said [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=786.96s)]
*  our country has seen the sickness and corruption of the Washington swamp. Why [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=789.96s)]
*  put swamp monsters in your cabinet? But they're not necessarily, everybody [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=792.96s)]
*  that's a lobbyist is not necessarily a swamp person, not every single person. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=795.96s)]
*  So that's a circular argument. No, it isn't a circular argument. I'm looking at [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=800.96s)]
*  Pam Bondi, Trump's AG, long-time lobbyist for Amazon, a company Trump doesn't [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=804.96s)]
*  like. General Motors, Uber, the Qatari government. Duffy, who's at Transport. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=809.96s)]
*  He was a lobbyist for Transport. You don't think that's corrupt? And they're [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=814.96s)]
*  examples of people that are wedded to the MAGA agenda to rule over [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=818.96s)]
*  President Trump. We don't know that. We don't know what agenda they're going to do. Yes, they are. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=822.96s)]
*  He's a long-time transportation lobbyist who's now the transportation secretary. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=825.96s)]
*  How is that Trump raiding the swamp? And a close friend of President Trump, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=831.96s)]
*  someone who knows President Trump. So your argument against corruption is to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=835.96s)]
*  say he's appointing lobbyists who are his friends. That doesn't make any sense. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=839.96s)]
*  Yes, well, it does make sense in this regard. They're loyal to an agenda he will [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=842.96s)]
*  implement. They're not loyal to a broader agenda of the Washington establishment. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=845.96s)]
*  Pam Bondi, who I know, is an example of somebody who is extremely capable and [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=850.96s)]
*  completely loyal to President Trump. So now you're just emptying words of all [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=855.96s)]
*  meaning. You can be a lobbyist, but as long as you're friends with Donald Trump... [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=857.96s)]
*  He never said you cannot be a lobbyist and be at my administration. He said you have [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=860.96s)]
*  to stop listening to lobbyists. He's listening to them. He's appointed to them. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=864.96s)]
*  Yes, he's listening to his friends. Some of them will happen to be lobbyists, but [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=866.96s)]
*  he's not listening to the lobby class in Washington, D.C. Oh, the lobby class. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=870.96s)]
*  Yes, it is. OK, so Duffy and Bondi and Suzy Wells. Let's talk about Suzy Wells. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=873.96s)]
*  During the campaign, Trump committed himself to one of the biggest goals in the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=876.96s)]
*  Republican Party. A goal I assume you share, which is going after China, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=879.96s)]
*  standing up to Communist China, taking a stand, right? Tougher than Joe Biden on [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=882.96s)]
*  China. Well, he has been. And yet, he's made Suzy Wells, his campaign chair, the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=886.96s)]
*  White House chief of staff, the most senior official inside the West Wing. And [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=892.96s)]
*  she was, until very recently, the co-chair of a firm that lobbied for [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=897.96s)]
*  Chinese companies in the heart of the White House. Yes. Chinese government [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=901.96s)]
*  must be delighted. No, because I know she is committed to President Trump and [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=905.96s)]
*  President Trump's agenda. How do we know that? Because, you know, this is the [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=909.96s)]
*  same thing as nominees as they appear before the Senate is. President Trump [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=912.96s)]
*  sets the agenda. If Suzy Wells was, I know she is committed to President [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=915.96s)]
*  Trump... It doesn't work like that. Yes, it does. Oh, it does. First of all, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=919.96s)]
*  the average president gets influenced by people around him. Donald Trump is one [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=924.96s)]
*  of the most easily manipulated people I've ever seen. You don't think she can [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=927.96s)]
*  push... Why do you say that? I think it's the other way around. I've seen him. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=930.96s)]
*  I think it's the other way around. Joe Biden, who's never fired anybody, is the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=933.96s)]
*  most... Everyone who's worked with Trump knows that John Kelly used to say, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=936.96s)]
*  last person in the room, with influence, and that's why he blocked him. Oh, yeah, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=939.96s)]
*  fired. So you're telling me, I'm sure Suzy Wells will be fired soon, and you'll... [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=942.96s)]
*  I don't believe that to be the case. Let's make a bet, shall we? We made a bet on [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=945.96s)]
*  who won the election. Sportsman, I never bet with you on that because I had a [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=948.96s)]
*  lot of experience with it. I always worried that Trump would win, I was one [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=951.96s)]
*  voting against it. But let me ask you this, Suzy Wells is lobbying... Was it at a [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=954.96s)]
*  company that lobbied for a Chinese company? If Joe Biden had appointed as his [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=958.96s)]
*  chief of staff someone from a company that was lobbying for China, you'd have [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=961.96s)]
*  lost it. You and the Republican Party would have lost it. No, I'm not sure I [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=965.96s)]
*  would have lost it. It's all over Washington, so prevalent that I would think [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=968.96s)]
*  it would be business as usual. The difference is, Suzy Wells is committed to [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=971.96s)]
*  the president's agenda now. It may be all over Washington, but I don't know the [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=974.96s)]
*  last time the president has appointed a chief of staff who was literally at a [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=977.96s)]
*  meeting with a Chinese company. I don't know the last time he was appointed [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=980.96s)]
*  a chief of staff who was literally at a meeting with a Chinese company. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=983.96s)]
*  But the question is, we will see how Suzy Wells comports herself now in the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=986.96s)]
*  Trump administration. That's her bad. We've already seen Trump rolling over [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=989.96s)]
*  when he's influenced. He talked about banning TikTok long before Joe Biden did. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=992.96s)]
*  He's now asked for the Supreme Court to suspend the TikTok ban until he takes [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=995.96s)]
*  office, which there's no precedent for, claiming that he will find a way to [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=998.96s)]
*  quote, save the platform. And this comes just a few weeks after he met with the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1002.96s)]
*  president. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1006.96s)]
*  As a Republican, are you not concerned to see Trump cozying up to a Chinese [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1007.96s)]
*  company that many top Republicans have described as, quote, spyware and the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1010.96s)]
*  largest maligned influence operation ever? [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1014.96s)]
*  You've got an easy list to win, Tom Pauly. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1017.96s)]
*  I am concerned about TikTok, and so is the president. Let me tell you. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1020.96s)]
*  He's not? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1023.96s)]
*  No, no, no, no, let me tell you, and mark my words on this, speaking about [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1024.96s)]
*  coming back on the program, is the TikTok solution will be a solution where [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1027.96s)]
*  TikTok is eventually run by an American firm and is divested of China. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1030.96s)]
*  That is going to be what's going to be the solution. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1035.96s)]
*  That may happen, but right now it's not. Right now Trump is going to bat for a [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1037.96s)]
*  Chinese-owned company. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1040.96s)]
*  No, he's going to bat to keep... [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1041.96s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1043.96s)]
*  He's going to bat for a platform that 170 million Americans like to use, I [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1044.96s)]
*  don't use it, like to use it and want to use it. So therefore, he is going to [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1048.96s)]
*  bat for a solution for this. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1053.96s)]
*  It has nothing to do with his billionaire donors involved in TikTok. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1055.96s)]
*  It has nothing to do with that. It has absolutely nothing to do with that. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1057.96s)]
*  So we've seen Trump influence, we've seen him appoint lobbyists. Let's just [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1060.96s)]
*  talk about other people he's appointed to his administration, not just the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1063.96s)]
*  number of lobbyists that's caused controversy. It's the number of men [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1066.96s)]
*  accused of sexual assault, rape and other heinous crimes. He nominated [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1069.96s)]
*  Matt Gaetz for AG, a man investigated by the DOJ for sex trafficking, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1073.96s)]
*  accused of sleeping with underage girls, something he denies. He nominated [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1078.96s)]
*  Pete Hegs. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1082.96s)]
*  And investigated for by the DOJ, and no charges. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1083.96s)]
*  And the health ethics committee said they found substantial evidence. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1086.96s)]
*  The Justice Department, which has more resources than a house ethics [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1089.96s)]
*  committee. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1093.96s)]
*  Higher bar as well. He nominated Pete Hegs to be defence secretary, he's [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1094.96s)]
*  accused of sexual assault, something Hegs has denies. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1097.96s)]
*  These accusations, these are accusations. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1099.96s)]
*  And he nominated Robert F Kennedy Jr. to be health secretary, who was [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1101.96s)]
*  accused of sexual misconduct by a nanny, something he hasn't even denied. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1104.96s)]
*  Does your party not give a damn about sex crimes anymore? I mean, adults, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1108.96s)]
*  this looks like the sexual assault administration led by a president. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1112.96s)]
*  Really? Those are loaded propaganda words. Sex crimes? They've been [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1118.96s)]
*  convicted of crimes? Hold on, hold on. A propaganda word. Let me read out [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1122.96s)]
*  with it. Liable for sexual abuse. The president of the United States, your [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1127.96s)]
*  boss. So the head of the administration was found liable for sexual abuse, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1130.96s)]
*  and he's appointed people accused of sex crimes. Accused, accused. Is [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1133.96s)]
*  that okay? In the old days. I could accuse you of anything. You're older [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1136.96s)]
*  than me. In the old days, do you think Ronald Reagan or George Warsaw would [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1140.96s)]
*  have got away with these kind of appointments? In the old days, in this [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1143.96s)]
*  regard. The new days are these. If any of these individuals had been [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1146.96s)]
*  convicted. So that's the bar now. You have to be convicted. So what's the [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1152.96s)]
*  point of a house ethics committee's investigation? An investigation that [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1158.96s)]
*  has not concluded that Mr. Gates never had an appointment. Substantial [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1162.96s)]
*  evidence that former Republican Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1165.96s)]
*  girl. Did he have an opportunity to refute these charges? So why appoint [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1168.96s)]
*  him AG when he hasn't done it? Why did Donald Trump nominate him? But he [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1171.96s)]
*  was accused. He's never been convicted of anything. So you're okay with [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1175.96s)]
*  that? You glossed over a DOJ, extensive investigation under a Democrat [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1178.96s)]
*  president of Mr. Gates that led to nothing. So that makes him qualified [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1183.96s)]
*  to run the DOJ? Makes him qualified to say that he never committed a crime. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1187.96s)]
*  You're saying someone? Hold on, I want to be very clear. But, Medhi, you're [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1192.96s)]
*  saying if people are accused of something, it shouldn't be appointed. Yes, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1195.96s)]
*  there's credible accusations. Credible? What's credible? The entire America [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1198.96s)]
*  runs on that basis. Credible. If somebody's credibly accused of it, they [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1201.96s)]
*  stand aside, they recuse themselves, they're suspended by the investigations [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1204.96s)]
*  going on. You don't make them attorney general of the United States of [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1207.96s)]
*  America. No, no, no. For example, in the Senate, in the United States, if [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1211.96s)]
*  you're indicted, you step aside temporarily from committee chairmanships. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1215.96s)]
*  That's a Senate rule. Not everyone agrees with that. Look how chilling your [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1221.96s)]
*  conclusion is. An accusation credible, that's a subjective term, credible by [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1225.96s)]
*  one side. The House Ethics Committee is not a credible group? That's just [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1230.96s)]
*  one side of it. That's a side story. You haven't heard. How about R.F.K. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1234.96s)]
*  Jr. at health? You have heard. How about R.F.K. Jr. at health? What about him? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1239.96s)]
*  He was asked specifically about the nanny accusing him of groping her. He [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1244.96s)]
*  said, I have skeletons in my closet. Speaking of nannies, I don't know, the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1248.96s)]
*  first gentleman, I think... Great distraction. Oh, really? Who cares? What [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1252.96s)]
*  about the first gentleman? Get this, he actually... Do your what aboutism, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1256.96s)]
*  and I'll just ask the question again. He actually said he was engaged in it. I [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1261.96s)]
*  don't care. I'm asking about the health secretary. Joe Biden has been accused [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1265.96s)]
*  of inappropriately touching women. And he denies it. R.F.K. Jr. hasn't denied [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1269.96s)]
*  it. He has not denied it. So why is Trump nominating him to the health secretary? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1273.96s)]
*  He has not been convicted of anything. So that's your bar. You can be the [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1278.96s)]
*  highest, most official in the country unless you're convicted of a crime. I [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1282.96s)]
*  don't think you can be, other than that, be the standard. Just an accuser. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1286.96s)]
*  Just an accuser. Is that because Donald Trump was accused by over two dozen [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1290.96s)]
*  women of sexual harassment? No, it's not because of that. Hold on, let me ask [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1294.96s)]
*  you a question. I don't have the fact checks in front of me. I'm going to take [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1298.96s)]
*  your word for this right now. Maybe I'll Google it later. I'm going to ask you [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1302.96s)]
*  a question. Did you support the impeachment of Bill Clinton? No, I did not. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1306.96s)]
*  You said you were not convinced of the crime. I told you why. Republicans cared [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1310.96s)]
*  about character and credible accusations. Do you know why the only basis [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1317.96s)]
*  about Bill Clinton, you can Google this later, is he committed perjury, okay? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1323.96s)]
*  He lied. He admitted later that he lied under oath. Under oath he lied. That is [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1328.96s)]
*  perjury. You and I both know Republicans went after him over the affair. The [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1334.96s)]
*  cheapening of the impeachment process, as we began with President Clinton, was [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1339.96s)]
*  a colossal mistake and has led to these disastrous political impeachment [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1343.96s)]
*  strikes. And now you have this new bar where accusations don't matter, only [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1347.96s)]
*  convictions do. Don't you believe in the right to defend yourself? I believe [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1350.96s)]
*  there's a criminal process, but I also believe politics... What if I accused you [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1355.96s)]
*  of something and you lost this position? Politics. That happens every day in [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1359.96s)]
*  corporate America, Don't vote. I would hope an accusation, unless you would [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1363.96s)]
*  resign yourself. I think two dozen women accused Donald Trump of something. I [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1367.96s)]
*  trust two dozen women over one guy. Two dozen women are all lying. Well, a jury [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1372.96s)]
*  in New York disagreed with you. A jury in the kangaroo court, yes. Convenient. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1377.96s)]
*  When you lose elections, they don't count. When you lose court cases, they don't [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1382.96s)]
*  count. I'm 96% Democrat. You and I have... Everything is kangaroo. You and I have [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1386.96s)]
*  discussed before... Let's talk about not Manhattan and not judges who are [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1392.96s)]
*  Democrats. Let's talk about Republicans. You and I have discussed before that you [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1396.96s)]
*  used to think Trump was unfit for office. You called him absurd, you called him [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1399.96s)]
*  unserious back in 2016 and then you had a come to Jesus moment. I'm just like the [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1403.96s)]
*  vice president and Nikki. Let's go through the list. His new cabinet is filled. I [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1408.96s)]
*  don't think I've ever seen a cabinet of any leader in any country filled with [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1412.96s)]
*  Americans. I've never attacked Donald Trump. His vice president called him [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1415.96s)]
*  America's Hitler. His secretary of state called him a con artist. His director of [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1419.96s)]
*  national intelligence called him Saudi Arabia's bitch and his health secretary [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1423.96s)]
*  said he scammed American workers. With friends like that, who needs enemies? When [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1426.96s)]
*  did they say these things? You tell me. Before we knew Donald Trump's record and [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1430.96s)]
*  Donald Trump's capacity... Actually, they knew his record. That's why they said he [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1435.96s)]
*  scammed American workers. It was based on his role as CEO. You asked me my [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1438.96s)]
*  question. I don't know what I should have said. It was a question I was [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1442.96s)]
*  making when I was supporting Senator Rubin. What about his new appointees? His [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1446.96s)]
*  own cabinet thinks he's Saudi Arabia's bitch, a con man and Hitler. Just like [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1450.96s)]
*  vice president Vance and others have come to see the record and have come to see [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1456.96s)]
*  the man. You know what? We were wrong. Well, we were wrong. She was specifically [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1460.96s)]
*  referring to his foreign policy at the time. Saying you're behaving like Saudi [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1466.96s)]
*  Arabia's D. She was a Democrat at the time. She was a Democrat at the time. This [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1470.96s)]
*  is political in that sense. But these individuals, as myself and other [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1476.96s)]
*  Republicans... You all just fell into line. No, we fell into line when we saw... [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1481.96s)]
*  You did a hostile takeover of your party. You went from John McCain to Donald [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1485.96s)]
*  Trump. We saw the record of accomplishment, as did the American people. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1488.96s)]
*  How many presidents have come back after one term? Just sticking with his [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1492.96s)]
*  appointments and nominations so far, why did he say he had no idea about Project [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1496.96s)]
*  2025? He called Project 2025 ridiculous and abysmal. And now he's appointed [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1499.96s)]
*  about 10 different people from Project 2025 to his administration. He lied, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1503.96s)]
*  didn't he? No, because what you're mixing up something here. Stephen [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1506.96s)]
*  Miller, Brendan Carr, Russell Vogt. All Project 2025 contributors are now in [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1510.96s)]
*  the administration. You're mixing up like Project 2025 is an entity. It's a [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1515.96s)]
*  project within the Heritage Foundation. He's appointing Heritage Foundation [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1521.96s)]
*  people. By law, the Heritage Foundation and Project 2025 could not cooperate [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1525.96s)]
*  with the campaign. By law. But he had nothing to do with it. He didn't know [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1530.96s)]
*  who was involved in it. He said he didn't know who was involved in it. And he [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1534.96s)]
*  appointed the people. I don't think he knew who was involved in drafting up the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1538.96s)]
*  project. But they all suddenly got top job. No, no. But wait, they're all [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1541.96s)]
*  Heritage Foundation individuals. And many aspects of... Have you read Project [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1543.96s)]
*  2025? Yes, I have. It's a thousand pages, right? Yes, I have. And I did a [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1548.96s)]
*  summary of it. Many, many, many, many of those aspects of that program, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1551.96s)]
*  President Trump supports, I support. It didn't sound like that during the [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1555.96s)]
*  campaign. But here's the difference. He didn't say that during the campaign. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1558.96s)]
*  There's a legal barrier between the two. There's no legal barrier to saying [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1561.96s)]
*  whether he agrees with the report or not. He made it very clear he doesn't agree [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1564.96s)]
*  with it, although now he's appointed all the authors. So my question, my bigger [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1567.96s)]
*  question, Adolfo, is why does he lie so much? Not just about Project 2025, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1570.96s)]
*  but about everything. For example, let me give you an example. As you know, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1575.96s)]
*  on January the 1st, tragically over a dozen people were killed in New Orleans [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1579.96s)]
*  as a man drove a truck carrying an ISIS flag allegedly into a crowd full of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1582.96s)]
*  people celebrating New Year's. A horrific incident that's now being [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1586.96s)]
*  investigated as an act of terrorism. Donald Trump, the president-elect, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1590.96s)]
*  immediately took to social media and blamed the attack on Biden's, quote, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1594.96s)]
*  open borders policy. He wrote, and I quote, when I said that criminals coming [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1597.96s)]
*  in are far worse than criminals we have in our country, that statement was [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1601.96s)]
*  constantly refuted by Democrats and the fake news media, but it turned out to [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1604.96s)]
*  be true. No, it didn't. That's not true. That's a lie. The driver was a U.S. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1608.96s)]
*  native born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. Trump lied, Adolfo, in order to [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1612.96s)]
*  demonize immigrants like you and me. Let me tell you something. No, he's not [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1616.96s)]
*  talking about you and me. He's talking about people who pose a threat to the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1620.96s)]
*  country. What had been reported initially, which I know Fox News retracted [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1623.96s)]
*  after seven minutes, had been that the truck and some of these assets had come [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1627.96s)]
*  in from Mexico. So the president responded to that. The broader point... [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1631.96s)]
*  He responded falsely. No, he responded with the fragmented information that [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1635.96s)]
*  was made available by the press at that time. No, that's not what he said. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1639.96s)]
*  He made a definitive statement. That's not how a president or a leader behaves [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1643.96s)]
*  at a sensitive time. And the FBI initially, leaders, including the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1647.96s)]
*  president of Biden, said it wasn't a terrorist attack initially. He lied [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1651.96s)]
*  about it being immigrant. Has he apologized for that? No. Has he corrected [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1655.96s)]
*  the record when he's spoken about the broader point? He immediately lies [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1659.96s)]
*  about immigration. No, it's not a lie. It was an American born and raised. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1663.96s)]
*  It is American born and raised. So you got it wrong. It is terrorist inspired [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1667.96s)]
*  by ISIS. There's no question about that. That's what he said, though. But, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1671.96s)]
*  again, the information that came out initially, Mehdi, was fragmented. He [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1675.96s)]
*  jumped, but he didn't need to jump on it. But let me tell you, the broader [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1679.96s)]
*  point he jumped to... Biden didn't say it. Mitch McConnell didn't say it. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1683.96s)]
*  Only Trump said it. Remains valid. The broader point remains valid. You [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1687.96s)]
*  don't get to lie on a broader point. That's not how lies work. He lied [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1691.96s)]
*  about New Year's. No, he did not lie about it. And we don't have an open [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1695.96s)]
*  border. We do have an open border. That's ridiculous. I just came into [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1699.96s)]
*  the United States last night. I could have shown you. It wasn't an open border. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1703.96s)]
*  Did you come across the border in the Rio Grande? And in the southern border, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1707.96s)]
*  do you know how many people have lost their lives? Why do people lose their [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1711.96s)]
*  lives? I thought it was open. It is open. There's not enough security. Are [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1715.96s)]
*  you trying to tell me the American people in November didn't make a decision [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1719.96s)]
*  basically? I think the American people got it wrong in November. Just like you [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1723.96s)]
*  think they got it wrong in 2020. Did they get it right in 2020? Did they get [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1727.96s)]
*  it right in 2012? Did they get it right in 2008? Come on, don't give me this [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1731.96s)]
*  populist nonsense. I want to stick with the topic. Lies. Here's another brazen, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1735.96s)]
*  demonstrable lie Donald Trump has told in recent days. After Elon Musk, the [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1739.96s)]
*  shadow president, came out in favor of H1B visas for foreign workers and the [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1743.96s)]
*  MAGA base came out against it furiously, Donald Trump told the New York Post, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1747.96s)]
*  and I quote, I've always liked the H1B visas. I've always been in favor of the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1751.96s)]
*  visas. That's a lie, Adolfo. He said in 2016, in a presidential debate and [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1755.96s)]
*  across the campaign, that the H1B visa program was, quote, very bad, unfair for [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1759.96s)]
*  U.S. workers, and, quote, we should end it. Why does he lie so much? We saw it [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1763.96s)]
*  with our own eyes. I don't think it's a lie. I don't think it's a lie. I don't [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1767.96s)]
*  think it's a lie. I think he's for the program, but it needs to be reformed. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1771.96s)]
*  And it needs to be reformed. It can be manipulated. It's been a system that's [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1775.96s)]
*  been used many times to sue employers because of its use. I understand the [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1779.96s)]
*  program. You understand the program. These are your views. Donald Trump did [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1783.96s)]
*  not say any of this. I'm going to read it out again. I've always liked the H1B [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1787.96s)]
*  visas. I've always been in favor of the visas. He doesn't say anything about [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1791.96s)]
*  reform. In 2016, he didn't say anything about reform. He said very bad, we [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1795.96s)]
*  should end it. He didn't say reform it. We should end it. So he lied when he [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1799.96s)]
*  said he's always gone. Cherry picking in this way. I'm not cherry picking. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1803.96s)]
*  Those are the only quotes. Which quotes are I less familiar with? Because you're [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1807.96s)]
*  taking things out of context. This is a desperate Trump defense. No, it is not. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1811.96s)]
*  Out of context. He's a toddler who you have to interpret. No, it is not. I'm [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1815.96s)]
*  reading his words. It is exactly what he has said consistently. The program has [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1819.96s)]
*  major problems with it. That's not what he said in 2016. I'm going to read it [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1823.96s)]
*  again to you. I'm going to read it one more time. Very bad, unfair, quote, we [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1827.96s)]
*  should end it. What does end mean, Adolfo? End means reform. If I recall, there's [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1831.96s)]
*  a sentence or two afterwards that we need to find better ways to bring people [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1837.96s)]
*  into the country legally. And that's what he's referring to. He explicitly says [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1841.96s)]
*  we should end the H1B visa program. Eight years later, he says, I've always liked [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1845.96s)]
*  it and been in favor. That's a lie. Anyone who understands English knows that's a [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1849.96s)]
*  lie. Unless English is your second language, that's a lie. Maddie, the program [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1853.96s)]
*  actually could be eliminated and replaced with a different program. Fine, why [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1856.96s)]
*  didn't he say that last week? Why didn't he say quote? I'm going to read the quote [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1860.96s)]
*  again to you because you don't like his words. I know. No, but you're taking them [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1864.96s)]
*  out of context. There's no context. This is a statement to the Post. Take it up [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1867.96s)]
*  with the New York Post. I've always liked the H1B visas. I've always been in favor [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1870.96s)]
*  of the visas. That is not true. He was not in favor of the visas in 2016. I believe [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1873.96s)]
*  he has always, and I know this committed to... What you believe is irrelevant, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1876.96s)]
*  Adolfo, with respect. It's what he said. This is what you always do. You come on [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1879.96s)]
*  and you say, you're confronting with a Trump statement. You try and find a way to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1882.96s)]
*  spin it, reinterpret it, because the facts are clear. He lied. It's when I take [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1885.96s)]
*  statements that President Biden or others have said, you said, well, I don't care [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1889.96s)]
*  about this. Joe Biden lies. He lies about Gaza. He lies about lots of things. We [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1892.96s)]
*  agree. What about Trump's lie now? He lied in 2016. It isn't lies. What is it then? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1896.96s)]
*  It's this. I think he has real problems with the program. The program might be [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1901.96s)]
*  eliminated and the program will be replaced. So why did he say that to the [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1906.96s)]
*  New York Post? He didn't say, I've got real problems with the program. He said, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1909.96s)]
*  I've always liked the visas. I've always been in favor of the visas. That is not [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1912.96s)]
*  the only statement he made about immigration or visas. That is the statement [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1916.96s)]
*  he made to the New York Post about H1B visas. That is what he said. People can [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1919.96s)]
*  Google it. You're right. You're right. OK, let's talk about Elon Musk, the guy [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1923.96s)]
*  who he's basically... Trump's now bowing the knee to. He's dominating our [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1927.96s)]
*  political debate, Musk. Well, let's go through it. He's loaded with comments. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1930.96s)]
*  Trump is... I just gave you a blunt quote. You're unfiltered. Trump plays golf [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1934.96s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago. Elon Musk is basically running the country. He's leading on the [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1938.96s)]
*  immigration issue. Let me go through it. He's leading on the immigration issue. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1941.96s)]
*  He's leading on the spending bill. He's having secret meetings with the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1944.96s)]
*  Iranians, reportedly. He's called for the prime minister of our closest ally, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1947.96s)]
*  the UK, to be deposed, removed from office. Is it President Musk and Vice [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1950.96s)]
*  President Trump? No, it is not. That is just silly. Is it? I just read out multiple [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1954.96s)]
*  examples. It is silly. Anything that Elon Musk is doing, he's doing in [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1959.96s)]
*  conjunction with President Trump, or President Trump's direction. Wow. So [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1963.96s)]
*  Donald Trump wants the British prime minister removed. That's a big statement. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1967.96s)]
*  Well, he has... Donald Trump has made a lot of statements about foreign [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1970.96s)]
*  leaders. Has he called for Keir Starmer to go? He has not. Because Elon Musk [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1974.96s)]
*  has. You just said they're coordinating. Well, they're coordinating in this [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1977.96s)]
*  regard, in the broader policy issues and agenda that they're going to bring [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1980.96s)]
*  forward to Doge. There is no question that Elon Musk has his own personality. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1984.96s)]
*  He does not have an appointed position in the government, as you know. But he [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1988.96s)]
*  is going to have specific tasks that are going to be given to him. Including [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1991.96s)]
*  calling for the fall of the British government. He has opinions that he [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1995.96s)]
*  might have. I don't think he's calling for the fall of the British government. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=1998.96s)]
*  He's literally said that, Adolf. You should spend some time on his horrible [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2001.96s)]
*  website. I know what he's done. He's literally said that British leaders [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2004.96s)]
*  should be in prison and the government should be dissolved undemocratically. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2007.96s)]
*  Called for a coup. Called for the king to dissolve parliament. He has called [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2011.96s)]
*  for other changes than the European countries as well. Trump... Well, that [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2016.96s)]
*  doesn't make it good. Donald Trump seems to be bothered by the insinuation [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2019.96s)]
*  that Musk is the real president. He even went out of his way recently and [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2022.96s)]
*  said that he can't be president as he wasn't born here in the US. It's now [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2025.96s)]
*  being reported this week that he's complaining to people that Musk is [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2028.96s)]
*  around too much. This is all just Washington gossip. Trump said on the [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2031.96s)]
*  record, he said he's always around. He said he's always around. He said he's [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2035.96s)]
*  always around. He said he's always here, can't get rid of him in Mar-a-Lago [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2038.96s)]
*  jokingly. So you get to put that in jokingly. We know that Trump is bothered. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2042.96s)]
*  Elon Musk is going to be a strong ally. How long until they fall out? They will [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2047.96s)]
*  not fall out. They will not fall out. Can I book you right now to come back [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2051.96s)]
*  on the show when Suzy Wilds is fired and Elon Musk and Trump fall out? Yes. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2054.96s)]
*  And I'll come back when they're still in. In four years, right? Four years. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2059.96s)]
*  No one... Why? Why? President Reagan shifted people. Trump had the [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2064.96s)]
*  fastest turnover we know. Are we not living in an oligarchy when the [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2070.96s)]
*  world's richest man gives over $200 million to help get Trump and [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2077.96s)]
*  Republicans nationwide elected, then gets rewarded with a government [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2081.96s)]
*  position in a totally made-up... Are you talking about Mr. Soros? Which [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2084.96s)]
*  government department is George Soros from? Are you talking about Mr. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2088.96s)]
*  Soros? Adolfo, which government department is George Soros from? He [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2091.96s)]
*  ran in behind the scenes pumping hundreds of millions of dollars to [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2095.96s)]
*  help Democrats and setting up an agenda. Musk is running a totally made-up [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2099.96s)]
*  government department where he can eliminate all his conflicts of interest. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2103.96s)]
*  He's not running a government department. He's investigating Tesla's [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2106.96s)]
*  bulk of investigations. He doesn't have a government department. He has [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2109.96s)]
*  a made-up department. How is that not corruption? Only Congress can create [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2112.96s)]
*  departments. Agreed. How is that not corruption and oligarchy? It isn't [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2115.96s)]
*  corruption and oligarchy. He just gets this reward to run things. It isn't [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2118.96s)]
*  oligarchy. I give you $200 million and I get a government job. People come [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2121.96s)]
*  in to government to advise through commissions or simple advisers or [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2126.96s)]
*  designated official functions of the president. I thought Trump does things [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2130.96s)]
*  differently. He's bringing in an entrepreneur. Is he a champion of the [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2133.96s)]
*  working class? He's a champion of growing the economy and a champion of [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2137.96s)]
*  being able to grow... That's not what I asked. Elon Musk gave $200 million or [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2141.96s)]
*  more and he got a job. How is that not corruption? It's not corruption to [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2145.96s)]
*  come in somebody who doesn't need a job, somebody who's going to come in. He [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2149.96s)]
*  does need to get rid of lots of government investigations. He needs to [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2153.96s)]
*  get rid of his government waste and abuse. You don't think Elon Musk is [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2157.96s)]
*  going to get rid of his government waste and abuse? He's going to get rid [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2160.96s)]
*  of his government waste and abuse. He's going to get rid of his [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2164.96s)]
*  investigations against his companies. Were you born yesterday? No, I don't [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2166.96s)]
*  believe it. I believe he's going to get rid of... He's going to get rid of a [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2169.96s)]
*  bureaucracy and all the fraud, waste and abuse. You don't think it's [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2173.96s)]
*  oligarchy that billionaires are getting jobs in government? That's the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2177.96s)]
*  definition of oligarchy. It is not. One last question. During this whole H1B [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2180.96s)]
*  interview, you said you think it's a good idea for Americans to, forgive [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2186.96s)]
*  my use of this language, to fill up the Silicon Valley tech workforce. Do [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2190.96s)]

*  that? I don't agree with that view. Should Elon Musk apologize? I can't [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2198.96s)]
*  tell Mr. Musk what he should apologize for. Donald Trump apologized. I don't [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2202.96s)]
*  think the president Trump has to apologize. One of his top appointees [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2206.96s)]
*  is Joe Biden. He's talking about extremely sophisticated positions in [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2210.96s)]
*  government. If you can't do sophisticated positions, you're [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2214.96s)]
*  retarded. If Joe Biden had called Americans retarded, would you be OK [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2218.96s)]
*  with that? No, he called Americans garbage. But if he called them [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2222.96s)]
*  retarded, would you be OK with that? I wouldn't. I wouldn't agree with that. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2225.96s)]
*  Would you have called for him to apologize? I think he should apologize [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2228.96s)]
*  for calling American people garbage. Great. OK, so should Donald Trump [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2231.96s)]
*  apologize for his appointees? The difference is, President Biden used [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2235.96s)]
*  the words Trump apologized for. Why should Donald Trump apologize for [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2238.96s)]
*  the words of someone else? Because the guy he's appointed. Was President [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2242.96s)]
*  Biden apologizing for things his cabinet and his official staff? I know [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2246.96s)]
*  your only defense of Trump is what aboutism. Biden's wrong. I'm not a [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcQbi4SaAGc&t=2250.96s)]
