Video Description: “We're not going to ask the Muslim community to vote for the people that are funding and doing the slaughter. So that means Vice President Harris is going to lose about 40,000 Arab and Muslim votes.”

As election night approaches, Academy Award-winning filmmaker and Michigan native, Michael Moore, talks to Mehdi. They discuss why Kamala Harris is losing voters in that key swing state, what she needs to do to win the election, and what Arab-American voters in Michigan want.

**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [October 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk)
*  I am not going to, with my white privilege, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=0.0s)]
*  wag my finger at the Muslim community in Dearborn [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=2.48s)]
*  and say, you, you've got to get out there and stop Trump. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=6.0s)]
*  No, actually, what they want is to have not another cousin die. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=11.16s)]
*  Last week, you heard my message to Kamala Harris [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=21.28s)]
*  on how she needs to do more to win the Arab American vote. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=23.44s)]
*  And while you may have been listening to me, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=26.6s)]
*  there's a slight chance that she wasn't, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=28.92s)]
*  but maybe she will listen to my next guest, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  who also shared a similar message to her quite recently. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=32.96s)]
*  Academy Award-winning filmmaker [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=36.04s)]
*  and Emmy Award-winning TV host Michael Moore [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=37.6s)]
*  posted his own plea to Vice President Harris, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=39.96s)]
*  stressing the need for her to win in Michigan, his home state, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=43.0s)]
*  where he says, quote, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=46.6s)]
*  the vast majority of Arab voters are either going to stay home [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  or they will show up to vote, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=50.24s)]
*  but leave the president line blank. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=51.68s)]
*  Michael Moore's message goes on to outline [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=54.08s)]
*  not only what Harris is getting wrong, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  but he also explains what she can do to make things right. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=58.0s)]
*  And he joins me now to talk all about it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=61.36s)]
*  Michael Moore, thank you for coming back on the show. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=63.28s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=65.32s)]
*  Is Kamala Harris about to lose Miss Michigan? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=67.28s)]
*  And if so, can she still win the election [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=71.6s)]
*  on November the 5th without Michigan, in your view? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=73.92s)]
*  There is a way to win without Michigan. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=78.16s)]
*  I wouldn't risk it if I were the candidate. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=80.72s)]
*  I don't, this is the part I don't understand, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=82.68s)]
*  is that politicians usually [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  will do just about anything to win. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  And in this case, when you made your appeal to her, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=91.4s)]
*  and I've made mine, you don't have to do a lot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=94.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  You just have to say that when you're president [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  on January 20th, this ends, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=105.16000000000001s)]
*  the slaughter of civilians ends. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=110.28s)]
*  I'm not going to continue that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=114.16s)]
*  As she said on Stephen Colbert, I am not Joe Biden. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=117.64s)]
*  That'll be one of the big changes in the new administration. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=120.84s)]
*  She made it clear that she's not the incumbent. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=125.67999999999999s)]
*  So it's, I don't, I don't for the life of me understand why. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=130.84s)]
*  And I said, and what I said to her is, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=136.28s)]
*  you really just need to go to Dearborn or Detroit, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=139.16s)]
*  stand on a stage with two Jewish leaders from the area, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=142.48s)]
*  two Muslim leaders from the area, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=147.92s)]
*  and just say what the majority of Americans in every poll [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=150.56s)]
*  are saying, end the war, ceasefire now, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=154.64s)]
*  humanitarian aid immediately to everybody. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=160.32s)]
*  What is so difficult about that? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=164.83999999999997s)]
*  What, you know, how does that say that you no longer, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=167.83999999999997s)]
*  do you think that they're worried, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  do you think that they're worried [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  that if they were to do that, number one, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=174.44s)]
*  they're picking a fight with AIPAC [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=176.48s)]
*  and the pro-Israel lobby, which they don't want to do, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=177.88s)]
*  with weeks to go, and number two, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=180.04s)]
*  they'll lose some Jewish voters in Pennsylvania [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=181.32s)]
*  or Michigan on the other end. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=184.16s)]
*  I don't, see, I don't believe that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=185.88s)]
*  No, I don't either, but I'm just saying maybe they do. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=187.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  Well, then she's listening to the wrong advisors. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=190.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=193.39999999999998s)]
*  She should stop listening to the men around her, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=194.51999999999998s)]
*  telling her the same old, old stories, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=197.76s)]
*  and also putting Jewish voters [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=201.2s)]
*  in such a condescending light. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=204.32s)]
*  Let me tell, I mean, let me say some, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  first of all, the Jewish and Arab community, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=210.56s)]
*  and communities in Detroit and in Michigan [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=213.2s)]
*  have actually always gotten, not only along, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=216.8s)]
*  worked hand in hand with each other [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=220.6s)]
*  for all kinds of issues, social justice, peace, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=223.0s)]
*  the environment, you name it, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=227.96s)]
*  there's just a very long history of this, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=230.16s)]
*  and to say that, oh, if she says one little positive word [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=233.84s)]
*  about stopping this war, she's gonna lose Jewish voters. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=239.16s)]
*  Jewish voters, let me tell you, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=243.72s)]
*  for my whole life in Flint and in Detroit, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=245.8s)]
*  they're not going to abandon their centuries old values [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=250.12s)]
*  and beliefs in social justice, in not killing civilians. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  All the things that we know that we grew up with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=263.24s)]
*  in Detroit and Flint with our Jewish brothers and sisters [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=266.68s)]
*  were very similar to the values of the Muslim community [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=269.92s)]
*  and the mosques in our area. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=274.96s)]
*  And when she spoke, that first rally in Detroit, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=277.0s)]
*  right after the announcement that she was the candidate, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=281.8s)]
*  and if you remember, that was a big crowd there, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=286.4s)]
*  there were protesters there inside, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=290.08s)]
*  chanting about to stop the war, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=293.2s)]
*  and that was where she made that very sad [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=297.24s)]
*  and infamous statement to the protesters, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=301.12s)]
*  hey, I'm speaking, you be quiet. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=304.88s)]
*  And it was very much that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=309.96s)]
*  And, but I know, I wasn't there, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=312.52s)]
*  but I know there are all people, friends of mine, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  and people that were there in that crowd [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  that were chanting, and I can't give you the exact number, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=320.88s)]
*  but I'd say at least a third of them were Jewish [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=324.96s)]
*  that were chanting, and not in my name. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=328.2s)]
*  So it's interesting you mention that finger wagging. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=330.64s)]
*  She also said that day, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=334.52s)]
*  and she's improved her rhetoric since then, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=335.4s)]
*  but that day she said, oh, well, do you want Trump? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=337.16s)]
*  She said some version of, the alternative is Trump. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=340.48s)]
*  Nobody wants Trump. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=343.08s)]
*  Well, actually, some Arab Americans in Dearborn [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=345.48s)]
*  have actually endorsed Trump, interestingly enough. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=349.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=350.96s)]
*  A minority, a minority, yes. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=351.8s)]
*  Mehdi, Mehdi, in 2020, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=353.4s)]
*  one third of the Arab and Muslim vote in Michigan [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=355.6s)]
*  voted for Trump. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=358.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=359.0s)]
*  And 70% voted for Biden and Harris. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  So here's my question, Michael, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=362.76s)]
*  when I'm sure you hear from a lot of white liberals [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=364.32s)]
*  who with the best of intentions, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=367.2s)]
*  but perhaps in a condescending way say, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=368.88s)]
*  Michael, these people, the Arab Americans, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=370.44s)]
*  do they not understand that however bad Harris [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=373.71999999999997s)]
*  they think she is, Trump will be worse for them? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=376.32s)]
*  Yeah, don't they know? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  Don't they know? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=380.68s)]
*  Don't they know that Trump will be, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  don't they remember the Arab, the Muslim travel ban? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=384.44s)]
*  And I'm like, why do you, stop talking to me that way. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  Ooh, they don't know. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=392.64s)]
*  You must educate these Arab types [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=395.04s)]
*  that Trump is bad for them. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=397.72s)]
*  Don't they remember? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you know what? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=400.36s)]
*  They remember. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=401.18s)]
*  And if you were to walk through Dearborn right now [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  and try to convince the majority of people [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  that they have to vote for someone from the administration [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=407.12s)]
*  that has killed their cousins, their family, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=412.6s)]
*  their community, their friends, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=417.2s)]
*  people who are living in cowering in fear, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=419.32s)]
*  not just in Gaza, but the West Bank also and Lebanon, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=422.47999999999996s)]
*  and tell them, don't forget the Arab, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=426.56s)]
*  the Muslim travel ban. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=429.47999999999996s)]
*  And the answer will be, oh, that's right. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=431.2s)]
*  Trump, Trump wouldn't let us fly. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=435.28s)]
*  That's the worst you can say really about Trump [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=440.56s)]
*  to convince Arab voters to, no. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=444.24s)]
*  I mean, there is much worse. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=447.32s)]
*  There is much worse about Trump, but you're right. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  Just doing it as a travel ban versus a genocide doesn't work. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=451.76s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=455.16s)]
*  In your plea to Harris, and in a Guardian piece [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=456.74s)]
*  I wrote a few weeks ago, we both pointed to the example [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=459.12s)]
*  of Vice President Hubert Humphrey, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=462.36s)]
*  who refused to break with LBJ on Vietnam in 1968 [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=464.44s)]
*  when he was running in LBJ's place, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=468.84000000000003s)]
*  just as Harris is running in Biden's place. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=470.38s)]
*  But when Humphrey eventually did, September the 30th, 1968, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  his poll rating shot up overnight. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=477.6s)]
*  He narrowed the gap with Nixon [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  and lost by half a percentage point. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=481.68s)]
*  We're now at the end of October in the same cycle, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  and Harris is still refusing to break with Biden on Gaza. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=488.0s)]
*  As you pointed out, she keeps telling interviewers [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=491.68s)]
*  she won't do anything different to Biden. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=493.68s)]
*  Why? Who is advising her? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=495.88s)]
*  What is their strategy? I'm losing my mind. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes, and I'm a little older than you, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=501.36s)]
*  so I remember September 30th, 1968. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=503.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't born, Michael, that's on you. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=506.76s)]
*  I was in ninth grade. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=509.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=511.88s)]
*  And already, by waiting that long, five weeks, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=512.72s)]
*  six weeks before the election of Humphrey, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=516.56s)]
*  it was too late really for him at that point. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=518.56s)]
*  But at that point, the more liberal left vote [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=521.88s)]
*  in the Democratic Party had already checked out. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=528.0s)]
*  They just weren't going to vote. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=530.96s)]
*  And well, why is that? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=533.84s)]
*  Wouldn't Nixon be worse? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=535.96s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's a matter. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=539.44s)]
*  To them, Humphrey was going to continue the war [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=540.64s)]
*  for another four years, no matter what he said. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=543.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=545.4s)]
*  Nixon won and continued the war for another four years. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=546.52s)]
*  The fear is that the moment has been lost, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  and that I just, I'm really, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=558.0400000000001s)]
*  I wish things would be said by the campaign [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=561.96s)]
*  that were out of a moral core. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=565.2s)]
*  That this is wrong on a moral level. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=569.2s)]
*  We need to stop this and we need to get some food [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=573.12s)]
*  and water and medicine to the people in Gaza. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=575.8000000000001s)]
*  And now, everything that's going on, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=579.76s)]
*  they don't even bother covering what's going on [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=582.36s)]
*  in the West Bank. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=583.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=585.5600000000001s)]
*  Her advisors, Michael, her advisors went out of their way [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=587.36s)]
*  to tell the New York Times that don't confuse [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=591.0400000000001s)]
*  her empathy for Palestinian lives with a change of policy. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=593.88s)]
*  It's not. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=596.9200000000001s)]
*  Like, they literally, it's almost, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=597.8s)]
*  as one congressman said to me recently, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=599.48s)]
*  it's almost like they're trying to lose Michigan in a way, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=601.36s)]
*  the way that the rhetoric is so harsh. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=604.12s)]
*  And one other example, you have her campaigning [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=605.96s)]
*  with Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney in Michigan, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=609.64s)]
*  as part of her final two-week closing argument. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=613.48s)]
*  That's madness, is it not? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=617.2s)]
*  Oh no, let's campaign with the person whose father [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=620.16s)]
*  was responsible for the deaths of how many Arab [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=625.16s)]
*  and Muslim people in Iraq when we bombed the hell out of it, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=628.6s)]
*  when we invaded a country that had nothing to do [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=633.28s)]
*  with 9-11 under the pretense of we were going after [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=637.24s)]
*  the 9-11 killers. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=640.52s)]
*  Why, yes, to answer your question, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=645.48s)]
*  why would a campaign purposely seem to wanna lose [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=647.52s)]
*  when they could just so easily, easily, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=652.32s)]
*  she doesn't have to solve the war today, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=656.44s)]
*  she's not the president, she doesn't hold any real power. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=658.4000000000001s)]
*  And we've heard early reports in the Times [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=662.36s)]
*  from months and months ago and other papers [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=666.0400000000001s)]
*  that quietly, behind the scenes in the White House, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=668.6400000000001s)]
*  she's been a vocal critic of Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=671.12s)]
*  and funding him and yet cannot bring herself, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=675.5200000000001s)]
*  really, I guess, to break with President Biden on this. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=680.88s)]
*  And even when shown the data [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=686.52s)]
*  that you might not lose Michigan. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  Just do this out of pure politics. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=695.72s)]
*  And not just- Just do it to win. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=697.64s)]
*  And not just data of polling, you're seeing Donald Trump [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=700.48s)]
*  is leaning into this stuff. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=702.6s)]
*  He's putting out statements saying, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=703.88s)]
*  Dick Cheney killed Muslims, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=705.36s)]
*  Muslims vote for me, there'll be no more wars. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=706.92s)]
*  He's got some actually clever folks for once, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=709.04s)]
*  giving him some good advice on how to win Michigan. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  He's actually putting out statements [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=713.92s)]
*  leaning into the idea that he'll be anti-war, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=715.56s)]
*  which is, of course, bullshit. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=717.52s)]
*  But he's saying it, he's playing the game to win votes. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=718.88s)]
*  Michael, in your plea to Kamala, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=722.28s)]
*  you asked Harris and her campaign, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=723.52s)]
*  you asked Kamala Harris to, quote, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=725.76s)]
*  state that there will be a new understanding [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=727.28s)]
*  with Israel in your administration, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  one that will lead the way to real peace [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=731.12s)]
*  and a two-state solution. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=733.4399999999999s)]
*  But do you think the two-state solution [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=735.3199999999999s)]
*  is even on the table anymore [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  when you have a far-right Israeli government [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=738.32s)]
*  that is currently trying to resettle Gaza? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=739.84s)]
*  Forget the West Bank. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=742.24s)]
*  Oh, I personally, see, we don't even have the time [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=744.72s)]
*  to get into this question, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=748.72s)]
*  because when you say, is the two-state solution on the table, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=752.2s)]
*  you're talking about my table? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=757.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't know, actually, if it is anymore. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=759.0400000000001s)]
*  I've listened to enough people in the Muslim [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=761.84s)]
*  and the Arab and Palestinian community [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=766.16s)]
*  in Flint and Detroit that they like the idea [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  of a one-state solution. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=771.6s)]
*  They believe that both groups of people [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=773.36s)]
*  can learn to get along and live equally [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  in a democracy without apartheid, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  and that maybe that's our only hope for peace in the future. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=784.9599999999999s)]
*  But the problem is, every time you hear that statement, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=790.8s)]
*  that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=796.0799999999999s)]
*  I took government class, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=801.8s)]
*  and I took a couple of political science classes [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=804.16s)]
*  in the one year I went to college. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=806.7199999999999s)]
*  And a theocracy is not a democracy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=809.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, an ethnocracy as well. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=815.16s)]
*  I think ethnocracy is a phrase that's often used. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=818.3599999999999s)]
*  What is it? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=821.12s)]
*  Ethnocracy is often a phrase used to describe Israel, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=821.9599999999999s)]
*  one superior ethnic group. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=824.24s)]
*  Yeah, and thus it's then not a democracy [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=826.48s)]
*  because you don't have a superior group, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=829.44s)]
*  legally legalized superior group in a theocracy [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=832.24s)]
*  or an ethnocracy or whatever it's called, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=837.12s)]
*  because that's just not equal. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=840.64s)]
*  And we all have to support democracy. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=844.6s)]
*  We have to support equality, justice, all of these things. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=847.44s)]
*  And so can this be solved in any other way [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=851.4399999999999s)]
*  than the fact that people living in this area [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=855.8s)]
*  are going to have to live in a democracy [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=859.56s)]
*  where everyone is equal, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=862.0799999999999s)]
*  where no one suffers under any form of apartheid. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=863.88s)]
*  How far away are we? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=868.48s)]
*  And I was gonna ask you this, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=869.4s)]
*  and I know we have to go, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=870.56s)]
*  but I was thinking just sitting here [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  before coming on with you. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=873.92s)]
*  It's just, it's gotta feel just God awful at this point, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=876.64s)]
*  like there's no hope. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=883.16s)]
*  There's no way of stopping the madness. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=884.48s)]
*  How do we, and I thought, and I was gonna ask you, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=886.6s)]
*  how close does this feel that, you know, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=889.96s)]
*  up to nine, you know, right after 9-11, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=893.04s)]
*  when 9-11 happened. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=895.4s)]
*  I mean, I was there in Gaza and in the West Bank [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=897.04s)]
*  when the first Intifada began. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=903.52s)]
*  The rising up of children throwing stones [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=906.5600000000001s)]
*  at the Israeli soldiers. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=909.76s)]
*  So this was, this started in December of 87. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=911.0s)]
*  I got there in January of 88, about a month later. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  Was there for a month, traveled throughout the West Bank [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=918.48s)]
*  in Gaza, saw the truth about what was going on. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=921.2s)]
*  And, you know, there was movement then [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=925.5600000000001s)]
*  to sort of, okay, we've gotta fix this. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=928.9200000000001s)]
*  We can't have this. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=931.2s)]
*  Crazy Sharon was going to the Temple Mount [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=933.4s)]
*  and just trying to stir up trouble [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=937.6s)]
*  and trying to get settlers to kill Arabs and Muslims. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=939.24s)]
*  But the feeling, you know, not being Arab or Muslim, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=944.28s)]
*  what that must've felt like when 9-11 happened, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=947.92s)]
*  that sense of, oh my God, there it goes. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  We're never gonna get this solved. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=954.48s)]
*  We're never gonna get this resolved [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=956.28s)]
*  because now all the focus is on the terrorist attack [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=958.0s)]
*  and we've gotta go get them, stop them. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=963.0400000000001s)]
*  And of course it would be another, what, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=966.36s)]
*  10 years before the Obama administration killed Bin Laden. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=969.32s)]
*  Bush had long given up on all that. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=976.48s)]
*  They got all the rhetoric out [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=978.6400000000001s)]
*  and they got all the justification for the killing out, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=980.08s)]
*  mainly because it was, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=983.88s)]
*  we were gonna get all that oil in Iraq. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=985.2s)]
*  That was really the under, we gotta win this war [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=987.9200000000001s)]
*  because that's our oil. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=991.6s)]
*  But if you were a Palestinian at that moment, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=993.48s)]
*  that sense of, wow, we're just, we're forgotten again. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=996.76s)]
*  Yes. We're doomed again. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1002.5600000000001s)]
*  And I just gotta say to anybody who's watching this [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  in Flint or Detroit or anywhere, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1007.24s)]
*  that if you are Muslim, if you are Palestinian, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1010.6800000000001s)]
*  if you have family there who are cowering in the dark, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1014.44s)]
*  hoping that the next bomb doesn't come into their tent, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1019.28s)]
*  that awful, awful sense that we are forgotten. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1024.84s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1029.96s)]
*  They won't even let us come on the stage [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1031.66s)]
*  of the democratic convention, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1034.12s)]
*  even after we promised our delegates for Biden, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  Biden terrorists. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1041.56s)]
*  No, you can't speak. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1043.16s)]
*  You don't exist, really, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1045.18s)]
*  which is what the rhetoric of the right-wing Israelis is. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1047.56s)]
*  They don't exist. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1050.9199999999998s)]
*  See the new map? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1052.56s)]
*  There is no Palestine. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1054.44s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1056.84s)]
*  I don't know what I know from my grandparents [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1059.8799999999999s)]
*  about the Irish immigrants in America, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1063.1799999999998s)]
*  the signs in the store windows, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1065.48s)]
*  Irish need not apply, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1067.24s)]
*  that the N word was used [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1069.82s)]
*  when talking about the Irish immigrants here, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1071.24s)]
*  that they were the N word of Europe [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1074.56s)]
*  and this sort of discrimination and bigotry [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1078.3999999999999s)]
*  toward Catholics, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1081.84s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1092.12s)]
*  It's the closest I can come to having some sort of empathy [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1095.6799999999998s)]
*  for people now watching this. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1099.24s)]

*  away from the election. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1103.32s)]

*  the campaign isn't gonna say anything. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1108.6s)]
*  The campaign isn't gonna do anything. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1110.96s)]
*  Do, and the things that you and I are asking for [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1113.56s)]
*  are not, give us back this land. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1116.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1120.32s)]
*  It's just say, stand there with two wonderful Jewish leaders [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1122.12s)]

*  you know this, that we are the culprits here. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1158.76s)]

*  This is on us, this is on our conscience. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1165.0s)]
*  And you know, I mean, this may take it too far, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1168.48s)]
*  but it's like, there's not a whole lot of difference [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1171.6000000000001s)]
*  from if you or I had given the airplane tickets [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1175.2800000000002s)]
*  to the 19 hijackers on 9-11, if we'd paid for that. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1180.76s)]
*  Now, you and I admitted, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1184.16s)]
*  we didn't fly any planes in the building. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1185.8000000000002s)]
*  We didn't kill anybody. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1187.4s)]
*  Yeah, but we helped to fund it. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1189.5600000000002s)]
*  And therefore, that would be on us, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1192.16s)]
*  the deaths of those 3,000 people. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1194.64s)]

*  that might be coming in a Trump administration. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1245.0s)]
*  And what I'm doing, Mehdi, I'll close with this. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1248.8s)]
*  I'm sorry to take, I know we're over time here, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1251.84s)]
*  but what I have been doing over this last month [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1254.4s)]
*  is just saying to people, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1258.44s)]
*  we're not going to ask the Muslim community [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1260.2s)]
*  to vote for the people that are funding [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1262.64s)]
*  and doing the slaughter. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1266.16s)]
*  So that means Vice President Harris is going to lose [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1267.48s)]
*  about 40,000 Arab and Muslim votes. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1272.48s)]
*  If you even just go by the standard polls. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1278.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1280.24s)]
*  She's, you know, again, remember, let's remember, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1281.08s)]
*  70% of the Muslim community in Michigan [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1283.64s)]
*  voted for Biden and Harris. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1286.3600000000001s)]
*  Of the last poll I saw, she had it back up to about 43%, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1288.24s)]
*  but that's still 30% less than in 2020. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1292.92s)]
*  So how do we make up for these 40,000, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1296.92s)]
*  at least 40,000 votes we're not going to get [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1299.16s)]
*  on November 5th. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1301.72s)]
*  And so my point has been, you know what? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1302.88s)]
*  There were 2,000,009 voters in 2020, in Michigan alone. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1305.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1310.88s)]
*  Just 2,000,000 that didn't vote, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1311.72s)]
*  we're going to have to find 40,000 votes there. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1312.64s)]
*  Or 75,000 who voted in 16, but didn't vote. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1314.8s)]
*  I'm sure Liz Cheney will get them off the couch. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1320.2s)]
*  Michael Moore, we will have to leave it there. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1323.96s)]
*  Thank you for your passion and energy. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1326.3200000000002s)]
*  And let's hope that someone on the Harris campaign [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1328.8799999999999s)]
*  gets it in the next two weeks. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1331.72s)]
*  We can only hope. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1332.9199999999998s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1333.9199999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1335.3999999999999s)]
*  And my apologies to those who are suffering through this [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1336.24s)]
*  and whose families are suffering through this. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1339.6s)]
*  I, because I pay my taxes. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1343.04s)]
*  I am a funder of this. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1345.84s)]
*  We all are. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1348.76s)]
*  And I have to live with that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1349.6s)]
*  Thank you, Michael Moore. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1352.4399999999998s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAv-eW53Jk&t=1353.28s)]
