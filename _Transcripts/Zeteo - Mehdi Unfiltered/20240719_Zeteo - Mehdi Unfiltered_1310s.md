# "Normal Trump is batsh*t crazy": Mehdi Hasan debates on the RNC speech
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8)
*  One does not need to listen to Trump to know how extreme he is, but only listen to the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=0.0s)]
*  chance of his audience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=4.64s)]
*  Fight, fight, fight, they all shouted as the president said one lie or false promise after [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=6.04s)]
*  another on stage at the RNC on Thursday night. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=11.44s)]
*  If you watch this show regularly, if you follow my journalism, you know that I'm not one to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  shy away from the F word. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Yes, fascism and the way it's quickly creeped into American politics ever since the rise [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=20.0s)]
*  of Donald Trump and of course his MAGA-ism. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=23.76s)]
*  And with a spineless GOP in Congress, a conservative court bent on carrying out Trump's wish list [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=27.08s)]
*  and Donald Trump leading in the polls again, it's clear that American democracy is in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=32.08s)]
*  grave danger. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=36.44s)]
*  But naturally there are people who disagree with that statement, people who may say, that's [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=37.44s)]
*  too alarmist. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=40.64s)]
*  One of those people who said that to me before is columnist and author Shadi Hamid. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=41.64s)]
*  Shadi and I got into a heated debate almost two years ago at MSNBC right before the 2022 [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  midterms with him suggesting that people like me may be too catastrophic, hyperbolic when [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  it comes to talking about Trump and MAGA-ism and the end of American democracy. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=55.04s)]
*  Back then I wasn't able to change his mind but of course a lot has happened since then [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  so let me give it another try. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=63.04s)]
*  Joining me now is Washington Post editorial board member and columnist Shadi Hamid. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=64.72s)]
*  Shadi, thanks so much for coming on Mehdi Unfiltered. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=68.96s)]
*  In the wake of the attempted assassination attempt against Donald Trump, you published [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=73.36s)]
*  an article suggesting that maybe Trump would have a change of heart writing, a brush with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=77.08s)]
*  death has at least temporarily ushered in a more reflective Trump. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=82.2s)]
*  He has been quick to praise God saying that it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  from happening. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=90.76s)]
*  You published that article and then last night, Thursday night, Trump basically was back to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=92.8s)]
*  usual Trump, crazy Nancy Pelosi invasion at the border, China virus, they cheated with [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=97.9s)]
*  COVID. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=103.56s)]
*  He didn't sound very reflective to me. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=105.26s)]
*  Yeah, well I'll just note in that column. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=107.68s)]
*  I did say that this was a fantasy. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=110.56s)]
*  It's good for us to fantasize for a moment. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=114.56s)]
*  So you didn't believe he was going to change? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=116.56s)]
*  No, no, I believed it was possible but I also just qualified and said I'm skeptical, it's [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=118.16s)]
*  probably not going to happen but anything is possible and you know historically we have [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=123.48s)]
*  seen how near-death experiences can actually lead to mini conversions or even just people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=128.56s)]
*  mellowing out a little bit. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=135.4s)]
*  I mean he had a near-death experience before. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=137.0s)]
*  COVID almost killed him. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=139.44s)]
*  But I will say that there was some change of tone, especially in the first part of Trump's [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=140.44s)]
*  RNC speech. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=145.76s)]
*  We did see a more somber reflective Trump and over the course of the past week he has [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=146.96s)]
*  talked about God a lot and again I don't want to say that this is going to change his governing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=153.0s)]
*  style if he wins and becomes president but it is striking to me that he's talking about [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=159.36s)]
*  God with what seems to be real feeling in a way that we haven't seen before and again [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=165.68s)]
*  I don't want to make this into more than it actually is. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=170.28s)]
*  So just to be clear where we stand today, Friday, you accept that Trump's RNC speech [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=174.84s)]
*  on Thursday night, he didn't sound like a unifying or moderate or change man. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=180.6s)]
*  He was the Trump of old for most of that 90 epic minutes that he kind of borders with. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=186.16s)]
*  But it is worth noting that when he was reading off the teleprompter and that shows that at [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  least the Republican Party itself is trying to choreograph and humanize Trump. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=197.8s)]
*  Charlie, surely you hear how you sound. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=202.8s)]
*  At least when he was reading off the teleprompter for like 10 minutes of the 90. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=204.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay, but look, in my column I'm not here to necessarily advocate and say I'm someone [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=209.08s)]
*  who wants to explore questions around religion and politics. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=216.24s)]
*  It's a big part of what I focus on in my work. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=219.4s)]
*  Trump is not a religious man. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=222.2s)]
*  He never has been. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=223.39999999999998s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  But I mean that's what makes it interesting to sort of like, you know, how will this have [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  an effect on him? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=229.92s)]
*  And what I did in the column, I looked at past assassination attempts, Erdogan, Gamal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Abdel Nasser in Egypt in 1954, Reagan in our own country, and assassination attempts can [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=235.67999999999998s)]
*  radicalize people and make them more oppressive and that's what we saw with Nasser and Erdogan. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=243.32s)]
*  So there is still a chance that Trump will really go back to full Trumpism if he actually [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=248.12s)]
*  wins and governs and be more vindictive against his enemies if he follows on those footsteps. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=253.70000000000002s)]
*  Reagan though did mellow out and did actually talk about dedicating the rest of his life [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=260.16s)]
*  to God. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=264.88s)]
*  Maybe Trump will be somewhere in this nebulous in between. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=265.92s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=269.48s)]
*  But what I want to do, because I've been so despairing of our politics, I'm trying to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=270.48s)]
*  kind of think more positively and I don't think there's any harm in doing that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=274.72s)]
*  And of course, there is a little harm in that you're imagining things that aren't there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=279.98s)]
*  I mean that's hard, right? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  You're saying, oh, Trump's maybe better than we thought he was, even as he continues to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=285.40000000000003s)]
*  give speeches that are batshit crazy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=288.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, I don't think the speech in RNC that he gave was batshit crazy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=290.28000000000003s)]
*  It was just, a lot of it was just normal Trump. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=296.16s)]
*  But normal Trump is batshit crazy. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=299.28000000000003s)]
*  This is the mistake you're making. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=300.72s)]
*  You're basically saying, oh, because he's denied the election before and said they cheated [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=303.36s)]
*  using COVID, that's normal Trump. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=306.88s)]
*  That's not a normal thing to say in any democracy that your opponents cheated using COVID. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=309.28s)]
*  You don't believe the 2020 election was cheated or rated with COVID. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=314.2s)]
*  No, but this is, I guess what I'm trying to say is that Trump is Trump and it's a low [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=317.2s)]
*  bar and that's what we got to work with. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=321.44s)]
*  Well, some of us are trying to raise the bar. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=323.48s)]
*  So after Trump's almost assassination, the editorial board at the Washington Post, which [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=325.12s)]
*  you're part of, put out a piece in which you all wrote, every participant in our civic [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=328.92s)]
*  life needs to conduct some soul searching. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=333.16s)]
*  When I read a sentence like that, it feels to me, correct me if I'm wrong, if there's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=335.88s)]
*  a bit of what we call both sidesing going on, as if everyone in our political spectrum [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=339.40000000000003s)]
*  is equally responsible for kind of violent rhetoric, incendiary conduct, ratcheting up [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=344.32s)]
*  the temperature, that the Democrats, the left are as responsible for incitement as the right, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=349.12s)]
*  but they're not. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=355.68s)]
*  Factually, all of the extremist related murders in America in 2023 were carried out by the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=356.68s)]
*  right. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=361.48s)]
*  All of the extremist related murders in 2022 were carried out by the right. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=362.48s)]
*  75% of extremist related murders in the US over the past decade or so carried out by [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=366.24s)]
*  the right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=371.24s)]
*  4% by the left. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=372.24s)]
*  The problem of violence and incitement and incendiary rhetoric is almost exclusively [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=374.4s)]
*  right-wing problem in this country. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=380.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, we didn't both sides in that editorial, but also in others. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=382.32s)]
*  We didn't draw moral equivalency. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=387.76s)]
*  We do always try to acknowledge that Trump and the Republicans are worse when it comes [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=389.91999999999996s)]
*  to this kind of rhetoric and talking in vindictive ways about punishing their enemies and all [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=395.68s)]
*  of that. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=400.64s)]
*  But I do think it's also important to look inwardly on our own side, if you will, and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=401.64s)]
*  to the extent that we are on the center or those of us who are writing about the center, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=407.4s)]
*  center left, we're not going to have a lot of impact with MAGA folks, but we can have [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=412.52s)]
*  impact with Democrats and left-leaning people. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=417.2s)]
*  And I think there is necessity for reflection. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=421.15999999999997s)]
*  Because I think when we... [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=425.0s)]
*  E.G.? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=426.0s)]
*  For example, what would you reflect on? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=427.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=428.44s)]
*  I mean, we as Democrats, we do talk, unfortunately, a lot about how Trump is going to destroy [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=429.44s)]
*  America and make America into an authoritarian fascist state that democracy is about to die. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=435.28s)]
*  And as you know, from some of our past debates, I have been and still am critical of that [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=441.59999999999997s)]
*  kind of approach. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=446.8s)]
*  I don't think that Trump presents an existential threat. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=448.2s)]
*  I think if he wins, it'll be a pretty bad four years and I'm dreading that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  And that's one reason I've been so... [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=454.91999999999996s)]
*  I went back to listen to our last discussion before this one, and I couldn't quite work [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  out listening to you then. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=459.96s)]
*  And I want to clarify now. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=460.96s)]
*  Is it your position? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=462.96s)]
*  You said a moment ago, I don't think that's a... [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=464.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it's a helpful approach or right approach. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=465.03999999999996s)]
*  Is it... [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=467.32s)]
*  I don't know if I'm talking to a journalist or a politician activist, because are you [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=468.32s)]
*  saying that we shouldn't say these things because they're untrue or we shouldn't say [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=473.15999999999997s)]
*  these things because they're received in a way that's not good for America? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=476.71999999999997s)]
*  Those are two different things. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=479.76s)]
*  Both. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=480.76s)]
*  Both. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=481.76s)]
*  On the level of truth, I don't actually believe that Trump is an existential threat in the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=482.76s)]
*  sense that I believe America and our institutions that were strong enough and resilient enough [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  to withstand the pressures that Trump will throw on us. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=492.52s)]
*  And I think it's also odd to say, well, American democracy is so weak, we have so little faith [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=496.56s)]
*  in our own country that we think Trump can topple our democracy in just a matter of four [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=501.56s)]
*  years. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=506.64s)]
*  Let's also be clear, Trump cannot run for a third term unless he changes the US constitution, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=507.64s)]
*  which is basically impossible because he would need bipartisan support for that. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=514.0s)]
*  So we will... [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=518.24s)]
*  So I'll come back to that moment. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=519.24s)]
*  Where I meet you halfway is clearly it's not good for America if we're always talking [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=520.68s)]
*  about the end of democracy, authoritarianism, fascism. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=524.9599999999999s)]
*  My counter to that would be what am I supposed to do as someone like you who explores these [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=529.0s)]
*  subjects, writes about this stuff, speaks about this stuff, when that is what the available [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=533.56s)]
*  evidence seems to be telling us, right? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=537.12s)]
*  That's where I differ from you in that I agree that it would be great if in this country [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=539.3599999999999s)]
*  we all start talking about the end of the world. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=543.12s)]
*  It's not great for our mental health. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=545.12s)]
*  Certainly not good for my mental health. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=546.5999999999999s)]
*  I wish I could talk about tax rates and minimum wage and not these existential questions. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=548.0s)]
*  But I look at the evidence and I do see US democracy under threat. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=552.84s)]
*  And since the last time you and I argued about this... [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=555.76s)]
*  Oh yes, it might be under threat. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=557.76s)]
*  I just don't think it's existential. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  When we use that word existential, we're talking about our existence in a nation... [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=560.9200000000001s)]
*  The subjective word existential because again, what would you describe as a threat to democracy [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=565.48s)]
*  that was tolerable, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=569.72s)]
*  So when you and I discussed last time, that was 2022. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=570.86s)]
*  Since then, and I just went through the list as I was thinking of this discussion with [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=574.24s)]
*  Since we last spoke, Trump has called for the termination of the constitution that you [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  mentioned a moment ago. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=582.0s)]
*  He said he wants to be a dictator, his words, for a day, of course, only a day, picked a [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=583.0s)]
*  running mate, JD Vance, who says he would have overturned the 2020 election had he been [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=586.96s)]
*  in Mike Pence's place. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=590.96s)]
*  He didn't need four years. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=591.96s)]
*  They could have done it on that day. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=593.1600000000001s)]
*  And of course, we have a Supreme Court that's literally given Donald Trump immunity for [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=594.6400000000001s)]
*  all crimes committed in office that are official acts. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  And of course, he has a handpicked judge in Florida who just threw out his classified [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=600.48s)]
*  documents case. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=603.6400000000001s)]
*  And of course, Project 2025, they're now saying, look, it's not just about Trump. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=604.84s)]
*  We have a ready to go authoritarian road map. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=608.24s)]
*  None of that has changed your mind at all made you think maybe I should take this more [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=611.6s)]
*  seriously than I have done in the past. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=615.04s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, I think I think all the things that you mentioned, I think make it [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=616.8s)]
*  very clear for me that if it comes to Trump and God, I mean, hopefully it's not Biden [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=622.52s)]
*  and we can talk about that if you want. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=628.04s)]
*  But Trump versus Biden, there's no doubt to me what Americans should choose because Trump [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=630.64s)]
*  is considerably worse. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=636.04s)]
*  I just I think that we have to just retain faith in in our ability to withstand the pressures [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=637.48s)]
*  that I mentioned. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=645.0s)]
*  Also, I think the bigger issue for me right now is the more we talk about this existential [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=646.0s)]
*  threat that Trump poses, people use that as a justification to just accept whatever Biden [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=650.48s)]
*  offers us. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=657.24s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=658.24s)]
*  Because Trump is so bad that even if Biden is comparable to a mop, then that's OK, because [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=660.2s)]
*  at least it's a way of sort of pushing us into submission to accept things that we shouldn't [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=666.96s)]
*  accept. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=674.04s)]
*  But you said one word before you move on. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=675.04s)]
*  I don't want to talk about Biden and Gaza before we run out of time. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=676.2s)]
*  You did say a moment ago, I have faith, use the word faith, which I thought was interesting, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=678.36s)]
*  because what happens when your faith gets it wrong? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=682.24s)]
*  And I'm talking about religious faith, your faith in the system in the in America, you [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=685.28s)]
*  said, you know, I don't believe democracy can be turned in four years. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=688.76s)]
*  I'm saying it could have been done in a day on January the 6th had Pence been J.D. Vance. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=690.92s)]
*  And you said, for example, on January the 6th, you said, as of today, we're going to [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=695.6s)]
*  have a peaceful transfer of power. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=698.92s)]
*  A tweet that you and I have discussed before you deleted the tweet. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=700.28s)]
*  You've very honorably said, you know, you got things wrong. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  It's not about whether you got it wrong. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=704.84s)]
*  Again, I wonder when you have so much faith in a system that actually, you know, most [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=705.84s)]
*  Americans don't have faith in our system. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=709.8s)]
*  Two in 10 Americans trust the government to do the right thing. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=711.56s)]
*  People don't have faith in the Supreme Court anymore. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=714.64s)]
*  They don't have faith in Congress. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=716.4399999999999s)]
*  They are worried. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=717.64s)]
*  Where is that faith? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=718.8000000000001s)]
*  Just blind optimism when the evidence says actually you could, you know, to quote the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=720.6s)]
*  famous line, it could happen here. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=724.64s)]
*  You could get fascism here. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=726.4s)]
*  American democracy could easily be overturned. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=727.64s)]
*  It's very brittle. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=729.24s)]
*  I would totally disagree with this idea that we could have fascism here. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=730.2s)]
*  And I've always pushed people and I think I pushed you, Mati. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=733.84s)]
*  What is the plausible scenario in which America becomes an actual dictatorship, not just using [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=736.9200000000001s)]
*  this language of autocrat dictator and just meaning very possibly? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=743.2s)]
*  I have a very simple answer before we move on. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=748.08s)]
*  Trump can do whatever he wants in office and it's not a crime, according to the Supreme [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=750.0s)]
*  Court. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=753.24s)]
*  That's what they've given. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=754.24s)]
*  A man who says, a man who says I want to destroy the Constitution and be a dictator has been [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=755.24s)]
*  told by the Supreme Court when you get to office, whatever you do won't be criminal. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=758.72s)]
*  That's a pretty toxic combination for allowing for complete degradation of our system. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=762.72s)]
*  Yeah, but who's going to stop him? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=766.9200000000001s)]
*  That's my question to you, Shadi. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=768.48s)]
*  Who's going to stop Donald Trump? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=769.8000000000001s)]
*  He says I want to stay for a third term, hypothetically. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=770.9200000000001s)]
*  Who's stopping him? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, we do have another party and it's still going to be close to 50-50. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=773.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, that allows us to get to our next topic. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=776.4s)]
*  They might lose everything. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=779.76s)]
*  Trump could come back with a unified MAGA government, House, Senate, the White House [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=781.0s)]
*  and the Supreme Court. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=785.76s)]
*  If that happens, then we as Democrats deserve what we get. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=786.76s)]
*  We will have put a candidate that is just so unimpressive and kind of pathetic. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=789.6s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=794.84s)]
*  Elections have consequences. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=795.84s)]
*  People have two choices and they make a choice. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=797.12s)]
*  And I'll understand if people decide to go in Trump's direction. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=799.12s)]
*  If all we as folks on the left can muster is Joe Biden, that means that we don't take [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=803.92s)]
*  the threat seriously. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=809.92s)]
*  Because if Democrats really thought it was an existential threat, they would actually [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=810.92s)]
*  get someone who can effectively prosecute the case against Donald Trump. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=815.5999999999999s)]
*  A lot of Democrats who I never thought would do this, like Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=820.0799999999999s)]
*  Barack Obama reportedly are pushing to get rid of Joe Biden as of Friday morning when [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  we're taping this segment. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=828.36s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=829.36s)]
*  He might be gone by the time it airs. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=830.36s)]
*  Although his campaign manager has been on MSNBC this morning saying he's going to be [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=831.48s)]
*  in the race. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=835.52s)]
*  I don't want to waste time talking about Biden's flaws because you and I agree on that and [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=836.52s)]
*  I've talked extensively to our audience about that. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=840.0s)]
*  I want to talk about just one point that Biden supporters make, which is a fair point. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=841.88s)]
*  I want to put it to you as someone who works for the Washington Post, which is that the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=845.6s)]
*  New York Times, the Washington Post are obsessed with Biden's age. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=848.28s)]
*  How do you respond to the critique that says, all right, he's old, he clearly messed up [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  at the debate, he's getting, you know, he's in decline. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=854.82s)]
*  But the disproportionate coverage of Biden versus a Project 2025, a Donald Trump who [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=858.06s)]
*  also gave an incoherent speech at the RNC, you know, his criminal conviction. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  One study found recently that New York Times published 200 articles on Biden's debate performance [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=869.2199999999999s)]
*  and just 92 on Trump's, half of which were about the Supreme Court decision. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=874.54s)]
*  The Washington Post as well has given a lot of coverage to Biden's age. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=878.6999999999999s)]
*  What is your defense to Biden supporters who say, yeah, he's old, yeah, he's not great, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=881.9s)]
*  but come on, the obsession with his age from the media is a bit much. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=886.06s)]
*  It's not that he's old, it's that he's incompetent. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=889.06s)]
*  It's that he can't finish complete sentences. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=892.3s)]
*  That he's not mentally or physically fit to be president. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=895.26s)]
*  But the disproportionate coverage, but he's up against a convicted criminal, which is worse. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=897.06s)]
*  Let's be honest. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=900.26s)]
*  A convicted criminal is worse, right? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=901.26s)]
*  Yeah, but of course, Washington Post readers and New York Times readers don't need reminders [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=902.66s)]
*  that Trump is bad. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=907.06s)]
*  This idea that we just keep on repeating the same things over and over and preaching to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=908.66s)]
*  the converted, that doesn't actually move the ball forward. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=913.4200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't actually offer something constructive. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=916.62s)]
*  Yes, we should continue doing that, but we also have to look and be self-critical about our own side. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=919.22s)]
*  That's what I've always said. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=926.02s)]
*  And if we don't have that level of self-reflection, and also I'll just add one more thing on that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=928.02s)]
*  For the last two years, there wasn't enough coverage of Biden's declining fitness. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=932.22s)]
*  Well, I actually think he's declined much more in recent months. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=938.22s)]
*  But there was, I mean, let's be honest. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=940.82s)]
*  There's been a lot of Democrats and also folks in the media promoting this idea that Biden was [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=942.4200000000001s)]
*  the second coming of FDR, that he was the empathizer in chief, that he's this wonderful foreign policy guru that knows all the... [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=950.82s)]
*  Let's talk about foreign policy before we run out of time. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=958.62s)]
*  But Democrats promoted a fiction about Joe Biden. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=960.62s)]
*  Joe Biden's a mediocre white man. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=963.62s)]
*  Let's just be honest about that. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=965.82s)]
*  Although we don't have time for this now. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=966.82s)]
*  His domestic policy record, put aside as foreign policy, is something that compares to at least an LBJ for sure. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=968.22s)]
*  Do you think Kamala Harris can beat Donald Trump? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=973.82s)]
*  I think she has a better shot of beating Donald Trump than Joe Biden. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=978.22s)]
*  She's not my ideal preference. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=982.22s)]
*  And that's why I hope there can be an open mini-primary mini-convention and that we actually have different candidates throwing their hats in the ring. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=984.22s)]
*  So Democrats can have a real debate about who the best person is. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=992.22s)]
*  Why should we just use Kamala as our default? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=995.42s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of reasons. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=999.42s)]
*  One is she's the vice president. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1002.42s)]
*  That's not automatic. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1004.42s)]
*  No, but she's already won votes in primaries and in a general election. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1005.42s)]
*  She didn't really win many votes in the primary. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1009.42s)]
*  As part of the Biden ticket is my point. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1011.42s)]
*  And she also has access to his funds that no other candidate legally has access to. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1013.42s)]
*  And of course, it will be a civil war in the Democratic Party if they overlook a black woman. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1017.42s)]
*  I want to challenge that premise, this idea that black people are going to be so... [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1021.42s)]
*  I mean, not everyone operates according to blind identity politics. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1025.42s)]
*  There's more to black and brown people than the color of our skin. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1029.42s)]
*  I agree, but you don't think there'll be controversy? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1033.42s)]
*  It'll be controversial, but why should we shy away from controversy? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1035.42s)]
*  Why are Democrats so afraid of debate, of really just talking about things in a frank, open way? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1038.42s)]
*  Politics is about conflict. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1044.42s)]
*  The convention is a time to really air out these differences. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1046.42s)]
*  And then whoever actually comes out in front, I have trust that Democrats will unify behind that candidate. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1050.42s)]
*  Because they won't have a choice at that point, let's just be clear. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1057.42s)]
*  Before we finish, Gaza. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1060.42s)]
*  You joined the Washington Post editorial board on October 1st, I believe. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1062.42s)]
*  Just days before, of course, the horrific attacks on October 7th and then the horrific genocide in Gaza. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1065.42s)]
*  You have been outspoken since then. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1072.42s)]
*  You've been calling for a ceasefire. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1073.42s)]
*  You've been criticizing Israel. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1075.42s)]
*  What's that like, being at the Washington Post, making these arguments, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1077.42s)]
*  when, let's be honest, most of the Washington Post columnists have lined up behind Israel and are happy to support what Israel's been doing? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1080.42s)]
*  What is it like for you taking that different stance? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1086.42s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm not sure if I'd really characterize all the Washington Post columnists having one particular view. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1089.42s)]
*  I think it's more diverse than that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1095.42s)]
*  I'm not sure that's true, but that's an argument for another day. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1097.42s)]
*  But your voice stands out as a pro-Palestinian voice or an anti-Israel bombing voice. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1099.42s)]
*  Yeah, sure. And I'm really proud that I can be at the Washington Post at this moment. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1104.42s)]
*  I mean, I believe the only Muslim columnist at a major newspaper and to really be openly and unapologetically talking about Palestinian rights and the brutality that Palestinians are facing. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1107.42s)]
*  And it's great that the Washington Post actually values that and values me being there. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1121.42s)]
*  And I think it really also shows that the mainstream of our political debate is shifting, where you have a growing number of pro-Palestine writers and commentators, including yourself, including people like Eamon Mahyiddin and so forth. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1126.42s)]
*  I mean, that would have never been possible post-911 to see this many Arabs, Muslims, brown folks actually kind of sounding the alarm about Israel's policies and America's relationship with Israel. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1142.42s)]
*  So something is definitely shifting, particularly within the Democratic Party. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1155.42s)]
*  And my hope is that a new generation will come in five, ten, fifteen years that will be more solid, like more balanced at least. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1159.42s)]
*  And that's not to say that the U.S. has to cut ties with Israel. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1167.42s)]
*  I don't think that's realistic. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1171.42s)]
*  But to actually have a balanced policy that talks about Palestinians as human beings, I mean, that's my hope. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1173.42s)]
*  And that's something that I'm going to fight for. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1179.42s)]
*  And as you're fighting for it, what is happening to Muslim communities in America? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1183.42s)]
*  Last question to you, you wrote in November last year for the Post. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1186.42s)]
*  But many of the Arab Americans who say they won't vote for Biden also report discrimination, growing fears for their personal safety. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1189.42s)]
*  Fortunately for Democrats, the election isn't being held today. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1195.42s)]
*  In politics, a year is a long time. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1198.42s)]
*  We've only got four months left. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1199.42s)]
*  That was a year ago. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1201.42s)]
*  What are you hearing from Muslim American, Arab American communities right now about who they're going to vote for? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1202.42s)]
*  Well, I think it's gotten worse since then because they already had doubts about Biden and now those doubts are piling up. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1207.42s)]
*  And Biden was also, let's be clear, terrible on the campus protests, the way that he talked about students actually doing what students should do, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1213.42s)]
*  which is expressing their grievances and their objections in an almost overwhelmingly peaceful and legitimate manner. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1224.42s)]
*  And Biden dismisses that and demonizes these protesters. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1232.42s)]
*  That was really hard to see because I think all of us as Arabs and Muslims, we know people who have kids or friends who were on the front lines in those encampments. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1236.42s)]
*  And it's like, wow, our own government can turn against our own community members, our own kids and friends and all of that. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1247.42s)]
*  That was really hard for me to see as an Arab and Muslim American. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1254.42s)]
*  So I think that I look, I think it's going to be hard for me in good conscience to make the case to my fellow Arab and Muslim Americans and tell them suck it up and vote for Biden. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1259.42s)]
*  Like on a level of just integrity and being comfortable with myself. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1269.42s)]
*  I don't know if I can do that in good faith, especially considering that Biden is also a very weak candidate for completely unrelated reasons. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1274.42s)]
*  So I think there is going this could really we haven't talked about it as much because everyone's freaking out about Biden for non Gaza related. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1282.42s)]
*  I agree. I agree. But let's we have to remember that Arab and Muslim Americans, but also young progressives aren't going to forget Gaza. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1289.42s)]
*  It's not as if it was already an issue. Pre the debate. Exactly. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1297.42s)]
*  Shadi Amid, we'll have to leave it there. Thank you so much for your time. Thanks so much, my pleasure. Thank you. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgIj_SbLZr8&t=1300.42s)]
