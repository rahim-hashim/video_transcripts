# Debunking Trump’s Plan to End Birthright Citizenship
**Zeteo - Mehdi Unfiltered:** [December 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI)
*  If you're born in the United States of America, you're an American, right? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=0.0s)]
*  That's how it's always been. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=4.08s)]
*  I mean, it's in the Constitution. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  But Donald Trump doesn't care about the Constitution, and he's been very open for a while [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=8.32s)]
*  about how he plans to end this core constitutional principle, end birthright citizenship. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=12.72s)]
*  You have people on the border, and in one day they walk over, have a baby, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=19.92s)]
*  and now all of a sudden we're supposed to pay the baby. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  We are looking at birthright citizenship very seriously. It's frankly ridiculous. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=27.04s)]
*  On day one of my new term in office, I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=34.08s)]
*  that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward, the future children of illegal [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=40.96s)]
*  aliens will not receive automatic U.S. citizenship. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  You heard that last part. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=51.04s)]
*  Trump not only thinks he can take away a right explicitly outlined in the very first sentence [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=52.48s)]
*  of the 14th Amendment, which explicitly says, quote, all persons born or naturalized in the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=57.279999999999994s)]
*  United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=62.16s)]
*  But Trump being Trump, he thinks he can get rid of it all by himself. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=67.12s)]
*  Not via constitutional amendment, not even via Congress, but via executive order. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=71.12s)]
*  Yes, our next president is planning on instructing government agencies to deny [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=76.64s)]
*  social security numbers, passports, and public benefits to newborn babies in the U.S. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=80.32s)]
*  whose parents don't provide proof of their immigration status. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  But here's the thing. Birthright citizenship isn't just explicitly laid out in the Constitution. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  It's also been explicitly upheld by the Supreme Court. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=94.16s)]
*  In fact, the relevant precedent here is over 100 years old. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  Yes, back in 1898, birthright citizenship took center stage at the Supreme Court [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  after Wong Kim Ark, who was born to two Chinese immigrants in San Francisco, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=105.92s)]
*  had his citizenship challenged by the xenophobic Chinese Exclusion Act, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=110.4s)]
*  which at the time banned Chinese immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=114.88s)]
*  Nevertheless, in U.S. versus Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court upheld his citizenship, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=119.92s)]
*  despite him being born to non-citizens, writing that, quote, the 14th Amendment [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=125.12s)]
*  affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=129.52s)]
*  Now, of course, the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=134.88s)]
*  doesn't have a great track record when it comes to upholding precedent [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=138.56s)]
*  or constitutional rights for that matter. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=141.6s)]
*  And with justices like Amy Coney Barrett, who once referred to the 14th Amendment as, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=143.92s)]
*  quote, possibly illegitimate, it's not crazy to think that this court may well give Trump [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=147.92s)]
*  their stamp of approval on this issue, which to be clear would be a shocking [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=153.12s)]
*  and shameless disregard for the Constitution. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=158.32s)]
*  And don't just take my word for it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=161.6s)]
*  Even James Ho, a conservative lawyer turned Trump-appointed judge, wrote in 2009 that, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=163.52s)]
*  quote, text, history, judicial precedent and executive branch interpretation [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=169.68s)]
*  confirm that the citizenship clause reaches most U.S.-born children of aliens, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=175.36s)]
*  including illegal aliens. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=180.08s)]
*  Now, as plain and obvious as the 14th Amendment is, when it comes to birthright citizenship, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  there are four words in the middle of that first sentence that Team Trump thinks [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=187.92s)]
*  supports their case against birthright citizenship. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=192.72s)]
*  It's the bit where it says, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  all persons born or naturalized in the United States [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=196.64s)]
*  and subject to jurisdiction thereof are citizens. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  Conservatives argue that part, subject to jurisdiction thereof, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=204.48s)]
*  was written in order to deny citizenship to anyone who still has loyalty to a foreign power, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  which they say includes people whose parents have not entered the country legally. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=213.44s)]
*  But this isn't the mic drop they think it is. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=218.23999999999998s)]
*  When the 14th Amendment was being passed back in the 1860s, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=220.55999999999997s)]
*  the senators debating it pretty much all agreed that it would apply to pretty much everyone, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=223.76s)]
*  including the children of foreign citizens with loyalty to other countries, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=228.72s)]
*  but excluding Native Americans on reservations. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  Congress agreed to adopt the interpretation of Senator Jacob M. Howard, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=235.83999999999997s)]
*  the author of the citizenship clause, who clarified the jurisdiction language, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=239.44s)]
*  saying that it meant birthright citizenship would not apply to, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=243.6s)]
*  persons born in the United States who are foreigners, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=246.96s)]
*  aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=249.28s)]
*  but will include every other class of persons. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  When Senate Judiciary Chair Lyman Trumbull was asked if birthright citizenship [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=256.8s)]
*  applied to kids of Chinese immigrants, he said back then, undoubtedly. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=260.96s)]
*  So, conservatives say they're originalists, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=265.84000000000003s)]
*  that the Constitution should be interpreted in accordance [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=268.8s)]
*  with the original historical era in which it was written. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=271.68s)]
*  And the senators at that time were clear that birthright citizenship applied to the kids of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=274.56s)]
*  all foreigners with the exception of foreign diplomats. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=279.52s)]
*  Oh, and remember US versus Wong Kim Ark? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=283.2s)]
*  That case also addressed this jurisdiction language head on, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=286.0s)]
*  with Supreme Court Justice Horace Gray writing for the majority that the Amendment's language, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=289.52s)]
*  quote, was not intended to impose any new restrictions upon citizenship. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=294.08s)]
*  Gray then confirmed that the language was only intended to exclude children born [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=299.92s)]
*  to Native Americans living on reservations, children of foreign diplomats, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=303.6s)]
*  and, based on English common law, quote, children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=307.36s)]
*  So, okay, that jurisdiction language was also intended to exclude children [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  of literal military invaders, which partly explains why Trump and the GOP have been [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  so desperately and so falsely and so ridiculously trying to brand migrants at the southern border [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=324.32000000000005s)]
*  as invaders. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=330.88s)]
*  Conservatives also like to point to the fact that in the Wong Kim Ark case, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=333.12s)]
*  Ark's parents were immigrants living here legally, whereas Trump's executive order would [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=336.32s)]
*  only go after children whose parents are undocumented. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=339.84s)]
*  But once again, judicial precedent is not on Trump's side. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=342.88s)]
*  Take a look at Plyler versus Doe, 1982. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=347.76s)]
*  The Supreme Court struck down a public school in Texas's attempt to deny admission to undocumented [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  children, saying, and I quote, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  In other words, even if you are undocumented, you are still within the jurisdiction of the U.S., [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=358.24s)]
*  and therefore birthright citizenship as laid out in the 14th Amendment still applies to your kids. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=376.08000000000004s)]
*  And yet Donald Trump thinks that's a, quote, ridiculous idea. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=382.32s)]
*  Now, how ridiculous were the only country in the world where a person comes in, has a baby, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=385.92s)]
*  and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States for 85 years with all of those benefits? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  For starters, that's not true. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=395.92s)]
*  Over 30 countries, including Canada right next door to us, also have birthright citizenship. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  But even if we were the only country in the world that offered it, so what? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=402.72s)]
*  Isn't American exceptionalism what this country is all about? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=407.52000000000004s)]
*  Isn't that what's supposed to make America great? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bujb18wW5HI&t=410.96000000000004s)]
