# Some Dali crew members remain in Baltimore 1 year after bridge collapse
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc)
*  Welcome back. One year after the container ship called Dolly struck and collapsed the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=0.0s)]
*  Key Bridge near Baltimore, 11 crew members who were on that vessel are still in the Baltimore [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=5.5s)]
*  area. They were asked by federal officials to stay in this country while investigators [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=10.94s)]
*  review the accident. That work is still going on. Now, fortunately for them, some groups [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  in the Baltimore area have been looking after them, even as they wait to return home. One [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=22.0s)]
*  of them, one of those groups, is led by Andrew Middleton. He is the director of Apostleship [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=26.54s)]
*  of the Sea, and I'm glad to say he joins me now. It's great to have you with us. Tell [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=32.22s)]
*  us about these folks, what they've been going through, and what you've been doing to help [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=36.82s)]
*  them out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=39.66s)]
*  Oh, thank you for having me, Major. Yeah, we still have 11 crew members here. You know, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=40.66s)]
*  it's... They're kind of stuck here in a position where everything's kind of an unknown. They [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  don't know when they'll be going home. They don't know when the legal process will be [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=56.82s)]
*  finished. So we're doing our best to support them spiritually, emotionally, meeting their [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=59.9s)]
*  physical needs. You know, we're doing grocery shopping trips to a local Indian grocery store. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=71.5s)]
*  We've done some baseball games, a trip to Washington, D.C., anything to kind of help [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=80.46s)]
*  break up the monotony of being stuck here and not being allowed to work for, you know, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=85.97999999999999s)]
*  a year now. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=92.58s)]
*  And as I understand it, Andrew, they're being paid. Their lodging is being covered by the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=93.58s)]
*  shipping company. They're just, as you said, reasonably, understandably, kind of bored [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=99.5s)]
*  out of their skulls because there are questions to be asked and answered, but that doesn't [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=107.06s)]
*  happen all that often, and they're just waiting, waiting, waiting, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=111.17999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're essentially sitting in their apartments, you know, day in and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  day out, trying to figure out what they're going to do for the next five minutes, let [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  alone the next five days, to entertain themselves. You know, we make every effort to try and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=126.66s)]
*  help them entertain themselves or do things that will entertain them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=133.3s)]
*  Right. And can any of them, if they wanted to, take odd jobs or work in any official [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=139.58s)]
*  legal capacity in our country in this interim time? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  I don't know that they can because of their visa status. So, you know, it's some of them [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  have expressed an interest in getting a job while they're here, but their visas, I don't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=160.1s)]
*  think are the correct visas in order to be employed here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=167.34s)]
*  And Andrew, as I understand it, they're mostly Indians and one Sri Lankan, correct me if [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=171.38s)]
*  I'm wrong on that, but all or mostly all huge cricket fans, and you've been sort of pulled [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=176.38s)]
*  into their cricketing fandom universe, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=182.18s)]
*  Yeah, so we've I've watched one cricket match with the entire crew when they were all still [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=185.62s)]
*  here. And then message with a few of them about cricket here and there. I know that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=193.26s)]
*  the master of the vessel is a big cricket fan. So he and I talk about cricket from time [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=201.89999999999998s)]
*  to time. One of these days, I'll figure out the rules and be able to actually enjoy the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  game as opposed to trying to figure out the rules. But it's something that we can we can [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=215.42s)]
*  share in common. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=220.78s)]
*  Andrew, I will ask you this favor when you do figure out the rules to cricket, will you [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=221.78s)]
*  get in touch with me? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=226.66s)]
*  I absolutely will. If I ever figure them out. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=228.33999999999997s)]
*  In the meantime, while you and I do or do not indulge our cricket watching habits, language [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=233.77999999999997s)]
*  barriers, faith barriers, what kind of just fundamental like day to day life things are they [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=242.34s)]
*  still working through? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=247.14s)]
*  Language is not not really an issue. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=249.66s)]
*  They all speak English. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  Religion, you know, our ministry is a Catholic ministry, but we don't discriminate based on [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=255.01999999999998s)]
*  on anyone else's religion. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=262.3s)]
*  So, you know, we're serving the Catholic crew, the Hindu crew without regard to that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=263.66s)]
*  You know, just just last week, I took a few of them down to one of the local Hindu temples [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=272.70000000000005s)]
*  for one of their festivals and spent maybe a half hour there with them, watching them [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=278.38000000000005s)]
*  celebrate and celebrating along with them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=287.86s)]
*  And do you get a feeling that they sort of gotten a different taste of Baltimore in that [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=290.22s)]
*  general region because they've been here so long and because so many folks have kind of [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=295.54s)]
*  come to their assistance? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=299.06s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  I you know, it's. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=302.58000000000004s)]
*  It's been their home for the last year, for better or for worse, and they seem to be [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=305.26000000000005s)]
*  learning as they go and they're able to navigate themselves around to and from grocery [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=311.58000000000004s)]
*  store and and local shops and entertainment to to. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=316.22s)]
*  Make life as normal as possible. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=322.02s)]
*  Well, if you can figure out cricket, you can probably figure out a garden variety metro [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=324.86s)]
*  bus line, and I guess that's one of the things that they've been able to successfully do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=328.62s)]
*  Andrew Middleton, thank you for your service to them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=332.74s)]
*  Thanks for joining me. I appreciate it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=334.86s)]
*  Thank you. Have a nice night. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlAGZIwkdvc&t=336.7s)]
