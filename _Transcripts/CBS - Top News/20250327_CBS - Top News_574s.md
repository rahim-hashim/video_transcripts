# Latest news on Trump administration as news of car tariffs startle industry
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o)
*  What we're going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=0.0s)]
*  States. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=7.96s)]
*  If they're made in the United States, there's absolutely no tariff. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=8.96s)]
*  We start off with a 2.5% base, which is what we were at, and we go to 25%. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=11.76s)]
*  President Donald Trump continuing his aggressive push to boost domestic manufacturing with [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=20.28s)]
*  new tariffs on all cars and car parts imported into the United States. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=25.8s)]
*  Those taxes are set to go into effect on April 2nd. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=30.0s)]
*  The president described the introduction of these tariffs as the beginning of Liberation [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=33.8s)]
*  Day in America. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  About half of cars sold in the U.S. are imported from countries like Mexico, Japan, South Korea, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=40.56s)]
*  and Canada. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=46.16s)]
*  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke against the tariffs just hours after Trump made the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=47.16s)]
*  announcement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=51.56s)]
*  Let's listen to what he had to say. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  You know, this will hurt us, but through this period by being together, we will emerge stronger. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=54.68s)]
*  I think what's happened, and this was part of our discussion, over the course of the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=62.2s)]
*  last several months, Canadian workers, Canadians as a whole across this country, have gotten [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=67.76s)]
*  over the shock of the betrayal and are learning lessons. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=74.72s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves and we have to look out for each other. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=80.52s)]
*  It would be appropriate that the president and I speak, given the action that he's taken. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=85.84s)]
*  I'm sure that will happen soon. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to give you a precise timing on that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=92.32s)]
*  The president hit back early this morning with a post on social media. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=96.08s)]
*  Trump seemingly threatened even higher tariffs on foreign goods by saying, quote, if the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large-scale [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=104.56s)]
*  tariffs far larger than currently planned will be placed on both them in order to protect [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=110.08s)]
*  the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=116.32s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Erin Navarro is on the ground with the latest. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=120.32s)]
*  Erin, good morning to you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=124.6s)]
*  Are retaliatory tariffs on some foreign partners still in the realm of possibility for the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=126.64s)]
*  president right now? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=132.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=134.56s)]
*  The short answer is yes. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=135.64000000000001s)]
*  And you're just seeing President Trump's tone change, as you mentioned, in this tariff [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=137.04s)]
*  trade war earlier before he put that post out that you mentioned. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  Trump actually talked about reciprocal tariffs, that he would be, quote, more lenient with [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  it, that he would be more on the somewhat conservative sides, that people would be [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=150.56s)]
*  surprised, but that it would begin to be applied to all countries. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  But he did keep the door open for exceptions as you're seeing Europe respond, as you're [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=158.36s)]
*  seeing countries like Germany asking the European Union to respond more forcefully. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=162.76s)]
*  That's where you get the tone from that true social post of President Trump that you just [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=167.08s)]
*  read. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=171.2s)]
*  So the White House is also dealing with the fallout of that signal group chat. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=174.2s)]
*  I mean, we've been talking about this for so long now. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=179.12s)]
*  Trump doubled down on dismissing the controversy, calling potential investigations a witch hunt, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=181.8s)]
*  something he tends to call anything he does not agree with. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=187.0s)]
*  We're going to play some of that sound and then we'll talk to you on the other side. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=189.16s)]
*  I think it's all a witch hunt. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=192.72s)]
*  That's all I think it's a witch hunt. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=193.88s)]
*  I wasn't involved with it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=197.0s)]
*  I don't I wasn't there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=198.32s)]
*  But I can tell you the result is unbelievable because the Houthis are looking to do something. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=199.56s)]
*  They want to know how do we stop? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=205.24s)]
*  How do we stop? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=207.8s)]
*  How do we have peace? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=208.8s)]
*  The Houthis want peace. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=209.8s)]
*  And so, Aaron, just based off of that, do we have a sense on if the president plans [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=212.26s)]
*  to hold anyone accountable for that signal text chain? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=216.92s)]
*  Yeah, yesterday, President Trump was asked if he supports the inspector general looking [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=221.51999999999998s)]
*  into the signal issue, which we just saw this morning is something that congressional leaders [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=226.28s)]
*  of both parties have called him to do. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  Trump did not oppose that. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=233.56s)]
*  And this morning, White House press secretary, Caroline Levitt, did call it, quote, a mistake [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=235.1s)]
*  and said that national security adviser Mike Walz has taken responsibility while still [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=240.28s)]
*  looking to move past this story. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=244.48s)]
*  Take a listen to what she had to tell reporters this morning at the White House. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=246.16s)]
*  We have never denied that this was a mistake and national security adviser took responsibility [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=249.56s)]
*  for that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=255.76s)]
*  And we have said we are making changes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=256.76s)]
*  We are looking into the matter to ensure it can never happen again. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=258.52s)]
*  But of course, the president has put together a team look at the Secretary of Defense, Pete [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=261.52s)]
*  Hexette, who was voted in by the United States Senate, putting our warfighters first, making [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=266.76s)]
*  the world a safer place for the American people and for all people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  And we're going to stay focused on that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=275.04s)]
*  Now, while Levitt, President Trump and Mike Walz himself have taken responsibility for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=277.36s)]
*  that, President Trump said yesterday that Defense Secretary Pete Hexette had, quote, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=284.04s)]
*  nothing to do with the signal chat despite him being the one to share those details of [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=287.56s)]
*  those missile strikes minutes before they happened. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=292.6s)]
*  OK, Aaron, I also want to ask you about new staffing cuts to federal agencies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=300.2s)]
*  Yeah, the Trump administration and the HHS plans to cut about 10,000 full-time employees [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  from the Department of Health and Human Services, about a tenth of that workforce there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=308.32s)]
*  2,500 will come from the Food and Drug Administration. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=313.84s)]
*  2,400 will come from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=316.92s)]
*  The agencies say the reduction will not impact reviewers, inspectors of drugs, medical devices [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=321.12s)]
*  and that no CDC infectious disease personnel are being cut. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=327.3s)]
*  But that combined with the offers for early retirement and the deferred resignation program [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=331.18s)]
*  means about 20,000 cut from America's health agencies. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=336.62s)]
*  Wow, that's a lot of cuts there. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=340.66s)]
*  Aaron Navarro, thank you so much for your reporting today. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=342.62s)]
*  And we are following market reaction as President Trump announced 25 percent tariffs on all [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  cars and parts imported. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=351.18s)]
*  The race starts next week and many are bracing for higher prices for the cost of a car. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=353.1s)]
*  But one of the largest labor unions in the United States, they say they support it. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=357.90000000000003s)]
*  The United Auto Workers Union says, we applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=362.5s)]
*  end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades, ending [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=367.58000000000004s)]
*  the race to the bottom and the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  So let's get to CBS News senior business and tech correspondent, Jolene Cairns. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=379.62s)]
*  Jolene, good to see you again today, by the way. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=383.34000000000003s)]
*  How could these tariffs affect the auto industry and consumers too? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=385.86s)]
*  Mugo, it's great to see you too. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=389.86s)]
*  Look, there are, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a million people in the [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=392.46s)]
*  United States who work in auto production. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=396.66s)]
*  So this is definitely going to have an effect. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=399.58s)]
*  You saw the reaction from the UAW here. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=402.14s)]
*  But we do know that the average cost of a car could increase anywhere between $3,000 [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=406.04s)]
*  and beyond $10,000, depending on the type of car you buy if these tariffs take hold. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=411.48s)]
*  25% across the board if they're manufactured outside of the U.S. and sold here in the U.S. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=417.48s)]
*  And so what that could mean is it could, with higher prices, mean demand for cars go down [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=423.36s)]
*  because the less people can afford to buy the cars that are being manufactured here [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=428.68s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=432.64000000000004s)]
*  However, it's important to point out that manufacturing here in the U.S., bringing it [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=433.64s)]
*  back will take time. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=438.56s)]
*  Yesterday, President Trump in the Oval Office did point to what he says is a new Honda facility [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=440.24s)]
*  that will be established in Indiana, but that won't come for several years. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=446.76s)]
*  And so the impact on jobs, while likely to have a material impact in the here and now, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=451.88s)]
*  is also likely to really materialize later on. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=457.56s)]
*  You also have to remember, as you drive down the road, you see these car dealerships everywhere, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=460.64s)]
*  right? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=466.28s)]
*  Two million people work in and around car dealerships in the United States. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=467.28s)]
*  Those jobs could also be impacted as well. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  And so when we look at the overall impact of these tariffs, it's certainly not only [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=474.08s)]
*  going to impact the trade relationships that we have with South Korea and Japan and countries [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=478.26s)]
*  in Europe, as well as Canada and Mexico. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=483.41999999999996s)]
*  We also know that it will impact the way people buy a car, how much used cars could [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=485.98s)]
*  cost that is likely to go up if these tariffs hold, because if people can't buy a new car, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=490.82s)]
*  they can't afford it, they're going to increase the demand on used cars. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=496.26s)]
*  And we know what happened during the pandemic when all of that went down, Muko. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=499.14000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, good perspective to have there. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=502.5s)]
*  I also want to ask you about Social Security. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=504.22s)]
*  The administration will start clawing back over payments from recipients, but how do [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  overpayments happen in the first place, and how will this move affect people? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=510.62s)]
*  So overpayments and Social Security benefits, Mugo, often happen when it's a miscalculation [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=516.46s)]
*  by the Social Security administration or a failure to update your current status with [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=520.98s)]
*  the SSA. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=526.38s)]
*  And so what the U.S. government is now saying is starting today, any cases of overpayment [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=527.62s)]
*  will result in having up to 100% of your Social Security check clawed back, which means you [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=533.34s)]
*  would not receive up to 100% of your expected payments until the overpayment is resolved. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=540.74s)]
*  Now, you might remember several years ago, there was a program put into place that allowed [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=546.82s)]
*  for 10% repayment over time. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=551.62s)]
*  And so people who have that current setup prior to today will continue to have that [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=555.3000000000001s)]
*  offered to them when it comes to getting most of their Social Security check with a 10% [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=562.7s)]
*  repayment for overpayments, Mugo. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=567.7s)]
*  Okay, Jill and Kent, thank you so much for joining us on the stream today. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=569.78s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWva4BO0X3o&t=573.34s)]
