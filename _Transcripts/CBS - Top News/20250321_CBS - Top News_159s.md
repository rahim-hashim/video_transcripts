# Russia continues massive airstrikes on Ukraine, U.S.-led peace talks to resume next week
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M)
*  Russian drones have hit Odessa, Ukraine igniting massive fires overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes after President Trump expressed optimism for peace talks that are expected [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=5.36s)]
*  to resume in a few days. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=8.96s)]
*  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the attacks, saying in part, joint pressure [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  on Russia by way of sanctions and defense support is the way to stop them. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=14.8s)]
*  Let's bring in Brian Taylor. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=19.2s)]
*  He is the director of the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at the Maxwell School at [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=20.28s)]
*  U Syracuse University. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=24.96s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us again. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=26.62s)]
*  Good morning, Glenn. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=28.16s)]
*  So, new talks are scheduled between Russia and Ukraine next week. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=30.0s)]
*  What realistically can we expect to come out of them? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=32.88s)]
*  Well, it's a curious situation in that both the Russian and Ukrainian delegations are [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=35.92s)]
*  going to be in Saudi Arabia to meet with the American delegation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=41.88s)]
*  It doesn't seem they're actually going to meet directly with each other. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=45.68s)]
*  So the Americans are probably going to be shuttling between the two sides. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=48.96s)]
*  And what they're hoping to agree on is what the terms of this stop to air targeting of [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=53.28s)]
*  energy and other infrastructure amounts to. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=59.6s)]
*  And Russia wants it to just be energy infrastructure. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=62.32s)]
*  Ukraine wants it to be strikes on all infrastructure. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=66.2s)]
*  And so there's a bit of a disagreement in the details there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=68.78s)]
*  So it's remarkable that Russia wants the United States to stop military aid. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=72.92s)]
*  They want the Ukrainians to stand down. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's no pressure being put on the Russians to do anything. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=79.44s)]
*  Would the Ukrainians agree to that? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=83.5s)]
*  Well, I think the Ukrainians really would like a broader ceasefire at this point. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=86.92s)]
*  At least President Zelensky agreed to that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=92.2s)]
*  Remember that the discussion last week was about or two weeks ago was about a ceasefire across the board. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  Then it was air and sea. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=101.16000000000001s)]
*  Now they're concentrating on air, but maybe talking about sea in Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=102.92s)]
*  But I think your basic point is right that so far, most of the pressure seems to be on the Ukrainians [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=106.92s)]
*  to make concessions and very little pressure on the Russians to make [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=112.44s)]
*  bigger concessions, given that they're the party that started the war. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=116.68s)]
*  And where is NATO and the European Union in all of this? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=120.76s)]
*  Well, this is an interesting part of this story because as the United States seems to be stepping [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=126.12s)]
*  back from supporting Ukraine and in some sense moving closer to the Russian position, the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=132.44s)]
*  Europeans are trying to come together and step up and support Ukraine in a more determined fashion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=137.64s)]
*  But there are questions about whether they can come to unity on that and whether they have all [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=144.76s)]
*  the military means that they would need to provide that support if it comes down to it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=149.55999999999997s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=154.2s)]
*  Brian Taylor, thank you as always, my friend. Appreciate it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, thank you, Vlad. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNSYrMCfS6M&t=157.79999999999998s)]
