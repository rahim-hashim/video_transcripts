# U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia appear to end but no news on Ukraine ceasefire
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE)
*  Now, talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia this morning have now reportedly [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=0.0s)]
*  ended. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=5.88s)]
*  Yesterday, the U.S. team met with Russian officials to discuss a maritime ceasefire [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=6.88s)]
*  across the Black Sea. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=11.38s)]
*  For more on this, I'm joined by CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=12.6s)]
*  Hey there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=16.8s)]
*  Good morning, Willie. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=17.8s)]
*  We're expecting the U.S. and Russia to release this joint statement hours ago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=18.8s)]
*  Why the delay? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=24.36s)]
*  Hey there, Errol. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=25.36s)]
*  Good to see you this Tuesday morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=26.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=29.4s)]
*  We expected that statement at 4 a.m. local time, 11 a.m. in Moscow, and that never materialized. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=30.4s)]
*  But officials are essentially calling these conversations between the U.S. and the Russians [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=37.0s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia very useful. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  But really, there's just nothing to share yet, because the Russians are looking over, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=44.339999999999996s)]
*  taking notes, of course, looking over this conversations that happened in Saudi Arabia [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=49.76s)]
*  coming perhaps to some type of decision. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=57.96s)]
*  Basically, they have to work out this maritime ceasefire deal in the Black Sea. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=60.6s)]
*  Of course, as you mentioned, that would involve a part adding on to that limited ceasefire [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=65.16s)]
*  that has already been agreed to by the Russian and Ukrainian leaders. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=70.64s)]
*  I'll also point out that Mike Walz on Face the Nation on Sunday said an aerial infrastructure [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=75.16s)]
*  ceasefire went into effect immediately after the conversation between President Trump and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  President Putin of Russia. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=86.56s)]
*  So details still being worked out, both sides in this case, optimistic that some type of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=88.16000000000001s)]
*  agreement can come about. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=95.0s)]
*  And perhaps we'll see that statement sometime later, Errol. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  And Willie, I want to ask you about some of the mass firings that we've been reporting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=99.72s)]
*  on the past few weeks, because the Trump administration yesterday asked the Supreme Court to pause [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=103.16s)]
*  a lower court decision, which requires six agencies to reinstate more than 16,000 federal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=108.7s)]
*  workers who were given the boot. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=115.48s)]
*  What more can you tell us about that? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=119.68s)]
*  Those probationary employees were perhaps to be reinstated following that lower court [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=120.28s)]
*  order. But the Trump administration is saying, look, you can't come in between the executive [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=125.36s)]
*  branch and its ability to make decisions about its personnel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=130.44s)]
*  That's essentially what they're arguing in this situation here, asking the Supreme Court [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=134.8s)]
*  to intervene to overturn this lower court order that, as you mentioned, would affect [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=139.96s)]
*  some 16,000 workers at the Veterans Affairs Department, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=144.76s)]
*  Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury, to be exact, all of those government agencies [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=150.56s)]
*  where these probationary workers who have been on the job for about a year or two would [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=155.44s)]
*  have been reinstated according to this order. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=160.16s)]
*  But the Supreme Court now, of course, has a case before it. It's not the first case [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=162.16s)]
*  to come before the Supreme Court, then the Trump administration. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=166.92s)]
*  I'll also point out that there are at least a hundred different cases challenging the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=170.32s)]
*  president's executive authority and what the president has started to do in his second [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=176.28s)]
*  term here, Errol. So lots to see here, but we'll have to wait and see as to what the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=180.84s)]
*  Supreme Court decides in this case affecting some 16,000 probationary employees. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=185.28s)]
*  Yes, so many people's jobs on the line with that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=190.48s)]
*  All right, Willie, thank you very much. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4kMwjUoSsE&t=193.16s)]
