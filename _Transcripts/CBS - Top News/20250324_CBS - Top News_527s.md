# Trump slams judge on El Salvador mega-prison deportations case
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw)
*  First, deportation flights to Venezuela resumed this weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=0.0s)]
*  Some of them included alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=4.64s)]
*  And in a few hours, the Trump administration will be in court. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=8.2s)]
*  They'll argue against a federal judge's decision to temporarily block their use of the Alien [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=11.68s)]
*  Enemies Act. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=16.8s)]
*  The administration used the 1798 law to quickly deport alleged gang members without due process. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=17.98s)]
*  Just this weekend, on Face the Nation, White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  defended its use. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=28.72s)]
*  We are saying that TDA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  This is how the Alien Disadition Act applies. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=36.2s)]
*  And we cannot have district judges interfering with the commander-in-chief's actions to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  take care of, in the way he deems necessary, a terrorist organization. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=45.66s)]
*  Now last night, President Trump took to social media once again. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=51.84s)]
*  He called out Judge James Boasberg, who blocked his administration from using the law to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=54.9s)]
*  conduct deportations. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=60.04s)]
*  Trump compared him to the judge who presided over his New York fraud trial and called for [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=62.18s)]
*  his disbarment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=67.3s)]
*  And we are staying on top of this story with CBS News White House reporter Willie James [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=69.34s)]
*  Inman and CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=73.3s)]
*  First, though, let's bring Willie in for more on the president's response to this case. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=77.25999999999999s)]
*  Willie, thanks for joining us today on a Monday. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  We are seeing Trump continuing to ramp up his attacks on the judiciary. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=84.22000000000001s)]
*  So what more can you tell us about that? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=88.86000000000001s)]
*  Hey there, Mugo. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=90.86000000000001s)]
*  Good to be with you and good morning to you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=94.06s)]
*  Well, that's certainly right. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=96.06s)]
*  That's what we've seen from President Trump via social media, as he posted yesterday on [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=97.38000000000001s)]
*  true social blasting this judge that is overseeing this case related to deportations of alleged [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=102.58000000000001s)]
*  Venezuelan gang members. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=109.5s)]
*  Now, CBS News has reported that some of these individuals do not have criminal records and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=111.5s)]
*  some of these individuals were in fact didn't necessarily have the due process to see a [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=118.3s)]
*  judge in terms of their deportation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  But the White House nonetheless pushing back against judges. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=127.34s)]
*  This isn't the first time that we've seen President Trump do this. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=130.14000000000001s)]
*  Of course, he himself has had to deal with the court of law over the past several years. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=132.82s)]
*  But the White House officials, the White House press secretary in fact, calling some of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=138.02s)]
*  these judges activist judges and President Trump pushing for this specific judge in this [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  case to be removed. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=147.46s)]
*  And this is certainly something that we've seen ramp up over the past couple of weeks [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=149.06s)]
*  as his agenda has really been thwarted by federal judges across the nation, Mugo. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Willie, thank you. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=158.98000000000002s)]
*  Now let's go to CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen for more on today's hearing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=160.34s)]
*  And Jake, what kind of arguments are we expecting today? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=165.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=169.34s)]
*  Well, the Trump administration has argued since the first hearing, which was over a [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=170.34s)]
*  week ago now, that Judge James Boesberg, who Willie just spoke about, had no authority [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=175.3s)]
*  to even put a temporary block because they believe that the Trump administration's invocation [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=180.70000000000002s)]
*  of the Alien Enemies Act is unreviewable, which means that the executive has the authority [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=186.86s)]
*  pleases with invoking that as to any group of people that it wants to and that there [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=192.0s)]
*  is no authority for the judge to even have done that in the first place, let alone the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=196.9s)]
*  decisions that he's made, which broadened and blocked the deportation from just the [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=200.82s)]
*  first five plaintiffs to the entire class of people who fit under this invocation of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=205.08s)]
*  that law. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=209.84s)]
*  Now, another thing at stake here is really just what the judges who are hearing this [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=210.84s)]
*  argument, how they believe and whether they want to parse through the invocation of that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=216.5s)]
*  to basically get to the point of, can these Venezuelan people who are subject to this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=221.1s)]
*  have their cases reviewed potentially individually, which is what the plaintiffs has asked for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=227.12s)]
*  the entire time? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=231.38s)]
*  They want and believe, Judge Boesberg put it in writing again today, that there has [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=232.5s)]
*  to be some kind of either administrative or judicial step before these people are just [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=236.5s)]
*  simply put on a plane and deported. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=241.0s)]
*  Again, there are very limited rights in these Salvadoran prisons. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=242.82s)]
*  It is basically once they're on the ground there, it's very hard to bring them back. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  So there are two big issues to look out for today. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=250.94s)]
*  And we know U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, she spoke about the case over the weekend. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=251.94s)]
*  What did she have to say? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=256.38s)]
*  Well she again, like the Trump administration has, and now 13 members of the Trump administration [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=259.38s)]
*  have criticized Judge Boesberg. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=264.09999999999997s)]
*  She is one of those people. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=265.9s)]
*  She said that the judge is blocking a top priority of the nation's national security [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=267.94s)]
*  and that Boesberg along with numerous other judges, which she name checked, have stopped [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  Trump from implementing his basically day one priorities of his administration and said [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=278.94s)]
*  that they don't have the authority to do that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=284.34s)]
*  She says that she expects this case to go to the Supreme Court, that the Trump administration [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  will fight it until it goes to the Supreme Court and a final decision is made there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=290.38s)]
*  There are a number of legal questions that play in so many of these different cases, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=295.02s)]
*  but she said this one specifically they're going to fight for. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=298.4s)]
*  And she again called Judge Boesberg unqualified to basically have any role in blocking any [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=301.12s)]
*  of these policies. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=306.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=307.58s)]
*  We'll see how all of this plays out in court. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=308.58s)]
*  CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=310.16s)]
*  Thank you for joining us today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=313.12s)]
*  Let's head back to the White House with Willie James Inman. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=315.22s)]
*  And Willie, we just learned President Trump is expected to hold a closed door cabinet [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=318.2s)]
*  meeting at this hour. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=322.44s)]
*  What can you tell us about this? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=324.12s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=326.12s)]
*  We're hearing from the radio pool that President Trump is expected to hold that cabinet meeting. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=328.74s)]
*  As you mentioned, it's going to be behind closed doors, closed press, so members of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=333.98s)]
*  media won't be in that meeting. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  But anything could change and we could perhaps bring you a little bit more information about [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=340.1s)]
*  that meeting. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=343.98s)]
*  But we of course know that Elon Musk has been a really key focus of the president's cabinet. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=344.98s)]
*  Although he's not a member, an official member of the president's cabinet, he has joined [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=350.22s)]
*  these meetings and he is expected to join this meeting today. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=353.94s)]
*  Okay, and let's talk about Greenland because U.S. officials and Second Lady Usha Vance [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  they're heading there this week. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=363.38000000000005s)]
*  What is the significance of these visits in light of the Trump administration's talk of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=364.70000000000005s)]
*  taking over Greenland? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=369.66s)]
*  Yeah, it really is a significant trip to have the Second Lady of the United States and to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=371.70000000000005s)]
*  have Mike Walz, the National Security Advisor, travel there and the Energy Secretary as well [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=379.06s)]
*  Although they're going on two separate trips, but there will be a chance for them to take [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=386.14s)]
*  in some cultural events. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=391.97999999999996s)]
*  Also the National Security Advisor is expected to meet with U.S. officials, U.S. military [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=394.21999999999997s)]
*  members on the ground there at a military base. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=401.38s)]
*  This comes of course as President Trump. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=404.62s)]
*  In fact, during his joint address to Congress, essentially said that he would like Greenland [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=406.38s)]
*  to join the United States. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=413.53999999999996s)]
*  The reason why in part is because of the strategic location of Greenland, the natural resources [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=414.86s)]
*  that that territory could provide. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=421.54s)]
*  But to Greenland's defense, the outgoing prime minister called this a provocation and the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=423.06s)]
*  Danes have made it clear. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=429.7s)]
*  The Danes of course run Greenland. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=431.9s)]
*  That's Danish territory. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=435.7s)]
*  They have made clear that it is not for sale. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=437.7s)]
*  Greenlanders have also made clear that it is not for sale that they do not want to join [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=440.7s)]
*  the United States, although we have this trip coming with U.S. officials, including the [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=447.42s)]
*  Second Lady, traveling there to the territory. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=451.82s)]
*  And Trump is also set to appear with Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry for a big economic announcement [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=455.65999999999997s)]
*  in that state. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=461.06s)]
*  Do we know anything about this just yet? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=462.38s)]
*  Yeah, we got a little bit more information about this. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=464.58s)]
*  This event is set to happen at 2 p.m. today. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=469.38s)]
*  The president and the governor of Louisiana are set to make this announcement with Hyundai [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=472.58s)]
*  making a significant investment of some $5.8 billion for steel manufacturing in that state [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9gTOFShNqw&t=480.02s)]
