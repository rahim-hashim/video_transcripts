# Trump privately irritated about Signal texts, Waltz having Goldberg's number, sources say
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU)
*  In Washington, President Trump is publicly backing members of his cabinet, but sources [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=0.0s)]
*  are telling CBS News he's privately fuming over the signal chat that included a journalist. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=5.24s)]
*  Sources also said after Mike Waltz admitted the authenticity of the Atlantic report, White [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=10.98s)]
*  House officials are debating if he should resign. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=16.66s)]
*  A federal judge has now ordered all records of the chat be preserved following a lawsuit [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=19.2s)]
*  from a government watchdog. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=24.88s)]
*  We've got team coverage on this for you this morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=26.16s)]
*  Nicole Killian is following developments from Capitol Hill, but let's begin with Natalie [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=29.2s)]
*  Brand at the White House. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=32.72s)]
*  Natalie, how is President Trump reacting to this still brewing controversy behind closed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=34.4s)]
*  doors? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=39.36s)]
*  Great, Errol, and it's different than how he's acting publicly because all week from [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=40.36s)]
*  President Trump to top administration officials, the White House press secretary, they have [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=46.16s)]
*  maintained that the president maintains full confidence in his national security team. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=51.64s)]
*  He has defended his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who is the one who inadvertently [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=58.18s)]
*  invited Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg inside that signal group chat, and also has [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=63.42s)]
*  defended his defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who we know from the reporting posted sensitive [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=70.34s)]
*  details about the military operation. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=76.3s)]
*  But as you alluded to privately, sources tell CBS News that the president is venting an [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=79.1s)]
*  irritation and monitoring, closely monitoring all of the news coverage that the White House [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=85.98s)]
*  has been trying to downplay this week. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=92.26s)]
*  One official described this situation is very much still a, quote, hot potato. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  And then the White House, note, Errol, has not ruled out the possibility of ousting someone [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=101.16s)]
*  over this or holding someone accountable. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  different probes, internal investigation and one that will be heating up related to a Senate [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=110.9s)]
*  request, which Nicole will be talking about in a second. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=117.5s)]
*  So there's a lot of details still to come. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=121.18s)]
*  CBS News has also learned, according to sources, that President Trump is very irritated, particularly [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=124.14s)]
*  irritated that his national security adviser had the phone number of journalist Jeffrey [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=130.54000000000002s)]
*  Goldberg in his phone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=136.86s)]
*  That is someone who the president has long criticized, even ahead of this situation coming [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=139.14s)]
*  to light. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  And as for this public show of confidence, sources telling CBS News that the White House [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  has been so vocal because they really do not want to hand the Atlantic or Democrats what [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=153.45999999999998s)]
*  would be perceived, Errol, as a win. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=160.73999999999998s)]
*  And meanwhile, Natalie, Mike Waltz is use of another app is also causing him a bit of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=163.62s)]
*  a headache. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=169.70000000000002s)]
*  And this app is something our viewers are likely to have used themselves. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  Help us understand what that is. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=174.18s)]
*  Yeah, we're talking about Venmo, the very commonly used payment app, which defaults [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=175.98000000000002s)]
*  to public, meaning if you don't change your privacy settings, your contacts and information [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=183.34s)]
*  about transactions could be public. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=190.78s)]
*  So CBS News has confirmed after some reporting by Wired, the tech outlet, that some top administration [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=193.86s)]
*  officials, even after the Atlantic article published, still had their settings as public, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  particularly Mike Waltz a day later, according to screenshots, had his contacts as public. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=210.78s)]
*  Now that changed, we believe, by Wednesday after the Atlantic article, a number of Trump [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=217.46s)]
*  administration officials made sure that their settings were private or even perhaps deactivated [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=222.98000000000002s)]
*  their accounts. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=228.86s)]
*  A national security spokesman says Venmo is a commonly used app and Mike Waltz has made [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=229.86s)]
*  necessary updates for his personal privacy protection, Errol. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=234.9s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand, with all the latest at the White House. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=239.62s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  Let's jump over to Capitol Hill now with CBS News correspondent Nicole Killian. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  Nicole, we know that a federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to preserve all messages [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=246.98s)]
*  related to this Huthi attack group chat on Signal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=251.9s)]
*  Explain that and lawmakers efforts to discover more. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=255.9s)]
*  Yeah, well, in terms of this lawsuit, obviously it was filed from a nonprofit advocacy group [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=258.94s)]
*  that was concerned that about whether or not these messages were classified into that's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=264.1s)]
*  why they filed suit. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=268.82s)]
*  And so as you mentioned now, the administration must preserve those records and file a status [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=269.82s)]
*  update early next week. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=274.9s)]
*  But it is consistent with some of the demands that we have also heard from lawmakers as [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=276.46s)]
*  well. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=279.82s)]
*  Many lawmakers, particularly Democrats, have also been calling for similar measures to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=280.82s)]
*  make sure that those records were preserved. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=284.82s)]
*  They're concerned that could potentially be a violation of the Presidential Records Act, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=287.62s)]
*  the Federal Records Act, if for some reason those messages or that signal text chain was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=291.02s)]
*  deleted. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=295.62s)]
*  Separate from that, there is also a bipartisan inquiry now directed at the Department of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=296.62s)]
*  Defense and its inspector general asking for an expedited review. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=301.78s)]
*  This is coming from the Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker and Senator Jack [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=306.61999999999995s)]
*  Reid, who lead that panel. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=311.82s)]
*  But they want the Defense Department watchdog to conduct a very quick review in terms of [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=314.02s)]
*  whether or not this material was classified. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  More details about this signal chain. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=322.5s)]
*  They also are demanding a classified briefing from administration officials. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  Nicole, there's one other headline I want to ask you about because yesterday President [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=329.02s)]
*  Trump pulled the ambassador nomination for New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik to become [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=332.14s)]
*  ambassador to the UN. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=338.14s)]
*  And it seems to be connected to the Republican majority in the House, but President Trump [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=339.94s)]
*  would have known that when he made the nomination. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=343.64s)]
*  So what changed since then? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=345.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=347.5s)]
*  I mean, you know, there are a number of special elections that are happening, one actually [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=348.94s)]
*  for Mike Walz's seat down in Florida. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=354.74s)]
*  But also if Elise Stefanik were to have resigned from her seat from Congress, that would have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=356.86s)]
*  opened up that seat. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  And there was concern that the governor there might take some time before holding a special [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=362.58s)]
*  election to try to fill that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=367.3s)]
*  And so all of that does kind of impact the margins in the House at a time where the president [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=368.62s)]
*  is trying to get a very robust legislative agenda passed in both chambers of Congress. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=373.3s)]
*  So for that reason, that appeared to be a factor in pulling this nomination from Elise [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=379.46s)]
*  Stefanik. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=384.18s)]
*  She spoke out about this for the first time last night after her nomination was pulled [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=385.18s)]
*  because she will now be returning to the House and GOP leadership. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=389.9s)]
*  Take a listen to what she says is next for her. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=394.14s)]
*  I'm going to continue speaking out. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=397.53999999999996s)]
*  The good news, Kayleigh, is because I am not pending confirmation, the American people [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  will be hearing a lot more from me because you're limited in what you can say when you [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=402.94s)]
*  So I'm glad to have joined Fox today, as I will continue to do, and just look forward [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=407.9s)]
*  to sharing my voice, as I always have, being one of the top fighters and top allies on [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=412.58s)]
*  behalf of President Trump. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=417.56s)]
*  House Republican leaders haven't specified exactly what leadership position she will [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=420.82s)]
*  return to because she did give up her seat as GOP conference chair, and the current chair [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=424.17999999999995s)]
*  right now, Lisa McLean, has indicated that she has no plans to step down, so again, remains [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=429.21999999999997s)]
*  to be seen what role Congresswoman Stefanik will take next. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  We'll keep watching that closely. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  Nicole, thank you very much. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyANyYc44RU&t=439.78s)]
