*  Signal platform that order to retain messages that were sent on that chain [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=13.44s)]
*  Don't delete any of them so that statement reads quote the Trump administration has and will continue to comply with all applicable [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=18.64s)]
*  record-keeping laws [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman streaming with us following that so what can you tell us about this? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=27.82s)]
*  Some messages automatically delete after a certain period of time this judge obviously wants them preserved [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=33.7s)]
*  Hey there read good to be with you on this Friday afternoon [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=40.34s)]
*  Well the White House is saying they will comply with that judges order and that judge is James Boasberg [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=43.94s)]
*  He is a judge overseeing this case a group seeking transparency about the situation [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=49.54s)]
*  Situation is suing to do just that to try to get some answers here and try to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=54.82s)]
*  Shed some light on this situation now as that legal process plays out the judge is ordering the Trump administration to preserve [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=60.22s)]
*  Those records now we do know that that signal message included a journalist [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=67.58s)]
*  From the Atlantic on those messages [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=73.42s)]
*  And that's why we saw them come to light because the Atlantic reported about that situation [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=75.78s)]
*  And this of course happens as the White House is seeking to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=81.18s)]
*  Not only handle the fallout from this situation, but to potentially fire someone for it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=84.98s)]
*  We know that behind the scenes there were conversations according to sources about whether or not Mike [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=91.1s)]
*  Waltz the national security advisor in this case who added that journalist inadvertently the White House says to that message chain [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=96.68s)]
*  Whether or not he should step down now. We know that he did not offer to resign neither [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=103.38s)]
*  The president asked him to step down, but those conversations did take place the president other officials are publicly supporting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  National security officials including the national security advisor the Secretary of Defense p. Hegseth who sent a play-by-play [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=117.0s)]
*  Of sorts sensitive information the White House says it isn't classified information, but certainly sensitive information [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=125.0s)]
*  About the attack on the Houthis in Yemen on March 15th [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=131.66s)]
*  And we know that the president has publicly supported those officials, but privately [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=136.14000000000001s)]
*  He has expressed irritation and is watching news coverage of the fallout closely read [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=140.62s)]
*  Well, and I'm also struck by that statement [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=146.18s)]
*  We will comply and that it was just kept to that because we know in recent days [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=148.18s)]
*  President Trump has gone head-to-head with this very same judge [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=153.3s)]
*  Relative to the fast-track deportations of those suspected gay members to Venezuela was that striking to you? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=157.62s)]
*  Yeah, it was really interesting to hear this judge's name pop up again now [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=165.06s)]
*  Essentially, there's nothing necessarily nefarious here or anything like that because this judge was randomly assigned this case [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=170.70000000000002s)]
*  James Boasberg is assigned to oversee the case of revolving around the president's use for him invoking the alien enemies act [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=177.74s)]
*  That is a a centuries-old law a wartime law that is used to deport people under wartime conditions [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=185.86s)]
*  The president executed that law in deporting these of Venezuelan [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=193.34s)]
*  Alleged gang members from Venezuela to El Salvador and so that is tied up in court for now [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=198.18s)]
*  But this is just a really interesting situation to play out here of this judge being assigned not only [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=204.46s)]
*  This case revolving the signal revolving around the signal [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=210.5s)]
*  Chat but also this case with the president's use of that wartime law read [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=213.94s)]
*  Well, there's also a lot of interest today over executive orders relative to this [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=218.34s)]
*  Sonia Institute walk us through that and what prompted that executive order [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=222.5s)]
*  Yeah, this is something that the president signed [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=227.45999999999998s)]
*  Just last night. We got the text of the executive order [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=231.14s)]
*  Essentially empowering the vice president because he serves on the Board of Regents for the Smithsonian [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=235.14s)]
*  Institution now this would empower him to look at things and root out what the White House is calling [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=241.22s)]
*  essentially a [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=247.94000000000003s)]
*  Culture of fight I should say in terms of what the White House is calling is directing the vice president to ensure that [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=250.42000000000002s)]
*  Future funding for the Smithsonian is not used on exhibits or programs [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=256.66s)]
*  specifically when it relates to things such as [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=262.66s)]
*  trans women or things that they believe or [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=266.18s)]
*  Or perhaps putting Americans against each other. That is the focus here [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=270.46s)]
*  I think we have for our viewers we can bring up some of the text of this executive order [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=274.9s)]
*  Part of that text reads the National Museum of African American history and culture has proclaimed that hard work [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=280.58s)]
*  Individualism and nuclear family are aspects of white culture [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=287.38s)]
*  I'm quoting the executive order there and then it goes on to say the forthcoming Smithsonian American women's history museum plans on [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=290.8s)]
*  Celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women's sports now [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=297.70000000000005s)]
*  This is part of that cultural shift and change the White House has made an effort to do in terms of looking at those [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=302.70000000000005s)]
*  iconic cultural institutions the Smithsonian [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=309.94s)]
*  Institute and its museums in this case the National Zoo to be included [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=313.18s)]
*  Also the Kennedy Center the White House has effort to make some changes there part of that cultural shift [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=317.22s)]
*  If you if you will describe it that way in terms of how the White House is looking to reassess different types and different [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=323.02000000000004s)]
*  Facets of American liferead Willie James inman CBS News White House reporter on Friday. Thank you for all of those updates [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CakSGlS9xY&t=329.94s)]
