# Israeli troops ordered to seize more territory in Gaza by defense minister
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk)
*  Now we're following developments in the Middle East for you this morning where Israel's defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=0.0s)]
*  minister is ordering troops to seize more territory in Gaza if Hamas fails to release [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=3.92s)]
*  more hostages. Let's bring in CBS News foreign correspondent Remy Inosensio live in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=9.76s)]
*  Once again, Remy, good morning to you. What else do we know about this new directive for IDF soldiers? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=14.72s)]
*  Ariel, good morning. Yes, on top of seizing those additional areas in the strip that you mentioned, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Israel Katz, the defense minister, has ordered troops to expand the security zones around Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=27.04s)]
*  And he says that this is all about the hostages and that the more Hamas continues its refusal [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  to release them, then the more territory, he says, it will lose to Israel. And a reminder, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=39.6s)]
*  it's believed 59 hostages, both alive and dead, are still held in Gaza. And this new order would [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=45.36s)]
*  apparently be building off of the IDF's initial operations that we reported earlier this week, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=50.64s)]
*  focusing on central Gaza and southern Gaza. The IDF dropped leaflets telling people to evacuate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=55.76s)]
*  certain areas. So those areas may also be expanded. And then there's, of course, their new loss of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=61.92s)]
*  lives. Nearly 600 people killed in the past four days alone in that IDF bombing. And there likely [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=68.08s)]
*  will be more strikes, more death, really, as we've been saying, turning the clock back even more, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=74.24s)]
*  as if that ceasefire over two months really hadn't happened. Wow. And Remy, the prime minister there [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=78.24s)]
*  has fired the head of Shin Bet. Help us understand the significance of that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=83.68s)]
*  Absolutely. Yes. And actually, Israeli newspapers, this is what they're talking about today. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=89.36000000000001s)]
*  This is unprecedented. It's the first time that the head of the country's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=95.92s)]
*  internal intelligence services, some compared to the FBI, has ever been fired. His name is Ronen [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  Barr. And the cabinet fired him in what was a unanimous vote late last night. Now Netanyahu [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  said that he lost faith in them. His allies accused him for the security failures of October 7th. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=112.16s)]
*  They say that he actually got intel the night before October 7th, but then didn't act on it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=116.8s)]
*  But there's always a flip side, right, Errol? Barr, turns out, was leading a high-profile [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  corruption probe into, guess who? Netanyahu, into influence from Qatar directly into his office. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=125.92s)]
*  Critics of Netanyahu say he's just trying to save his own skin, firing the chief, and then trying to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=131.84s)]
*  install someone who will be an ally. This case is now headed to the high court. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=136.24s)]
*  Rami Enosensio, thank you very much. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmM45F2_hfk&t=141.76s)]
