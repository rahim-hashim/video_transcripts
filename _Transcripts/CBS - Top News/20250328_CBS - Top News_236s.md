# Myanmar asks for international assistance after deadly earthquake
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI)
*  And you and I were talking earlier this morning, how significant is it that the military junta there is asking for international help? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, Errol, as you know, the military junta seized power in a coup back in February of 2021. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=12.08s)]
*  And since then, it's very much been isolated from certainly the West diplomatically. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=19.76s)]
*  The country engulfed in civil war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=28.0s)]
*  So the fact that the military junta has asked for international assistance would certainly [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=30.48s)]
*  indicate how desperate and dire the situation is on the ground. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  We've heard from local officials from Napier, that is the capital of Myanmar, the hospital there [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=42.64s)]
*  is the same quote of mass casualty. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=50.32s)]
*  So you can only imagine what is transforming there on the ground with the number of injured. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  And we don't even know what the death toll could be. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=65.92s)]
*  But the epicentre was Mandalay, it's the second largest city, it's home to more than a million [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=69.04s)]
*  people we've seen. Temples and mosques just crumble. We know that there were worshippers inside. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=74.16s)]
*  There is footage from Mandalay University which is engulfed in flames, these black plumes of smoke [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=81.92s)]
*  just billowing from the university. There's bridges connecting across rivers that have just [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=89.04s)]
*  collapsed. So this is a country where the infrastructure has obviously been greatly [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=96.64s)]
*  damaged. We know that there are many people who have been injured if not killed. And we will have [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=102.56s)]
*  to wait for those international teams to reach the ground to assess how bad the situation is. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=108.88s)]
*  And as you were speaking we're just seeing some of the early images out of Myanmar showing the [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=116.88s)]
*  destruction there. But most of the footage we're seeing is coming out of Bangkok in Thailand, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=121.36s)]
*  hundreds of miles away from the epicentre and in a place where some buildings are actually built [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=126.64s)]
*  to withstand quakes. Help us understand the situation in Bangkok and what we've been seeing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=133.2s)]
*  It's interesting, Aral, because Myanmar is prone to earthquakes but to reach Bangkok, that is [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=139.12s)]
*  unheard of. I've spoken to friends and relatives there who live in the city and they say they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=148.48s)]
*  cannot remember the last time there was an earthquake. And it was a 7.7 magnitude quake, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  there was a 6.4 aftershock that came 11, 12 minutes later. Many people terrified of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=158.88s)]
*  re-entering their homes. Remember this is a high rise city, 17 million people live in Bangkok and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=166.88s)]
*  many of them ran out onto the streets just terrified that there could be even further [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=174.4s)]
*  aftershocks. But that footage of that skyscraper, that 30 story skyscraper that was under [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=181.76s)]
*  construction collapsing is absolutely terrifying. You mentioned the death toll of the buildings [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  the death toll as it stands officially, the defence minister is saying three dead, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=195.92s)]
*  but we know that there are at least 90 missing. And you look at the slabs of concrete, Aral, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=200.32s)]
*  30 stories, you know, just sandwiched and crumpled on the ground. So obviously authorities [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  fearing that death toll will rise. Yeah, yeah, we fear the same. The footage as it is is just [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  shocking to see Anna Corrin with the latest for us out of Hong Kong. You're looking at footage there [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=219.76s)]
*  out of Bangkok, that building under construction collapsing after the quake and aftershock. Anna, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=224.88s)]
*  thank you. And we will continue to monitor these developments throughout the day. So stay close to [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  CBS News 24 seven. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr5Q5EdGZI&t=234.48s)]
