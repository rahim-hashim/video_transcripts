# Expert warns of aftershocks in Myanmar after deadly earthquakes
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0)
*  Massive earthquakes in Southeast Asia have killed dozens of people and wreaked havoc [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=0.0s)]
*  across Myanmar and Thailand. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  A 7.7 magnitude quake struck near Mandalay, Myanmar's second largest city this afternoon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=6.24s)]
*  Aftershocks followed, one of them measuring 6.4 magnitude. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=11.72s)]
*  Officials say more than 140 people are dead in Myanmar and hundreds of others are injured. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=16.52s)]
*  In Thailand, a high-rise building that was under construction collapsed, killing at least [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=21.66s)]
*  eight people in the capital of Bangkok. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=25.92s)]
*  Incredible video there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=29.6s)]
*  I want to bring in Jeming Wong. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=30.6s)]
*  He's an associate professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Kentucky. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=31.6s)]
*  Jeming, thanks for being here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Earthquakes pretty common in this region. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=38.6s)]
*  Why is this causing so much damage and such a high death toll? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=39.92s)]
*  I think it's one, two things. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  One, you know, the Myanmar is a poor country and all that you can see now is the construction. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=45.84s)]
*  The material is really more mortar, more kind of the concrete buildings. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  That is not good for earthquake resistance. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=59.32s)]
*  The other thing is quite dramatic, what I see in Bangkok. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=62.64s)]
*  If you look at Bangkok, it's really more than a thousand kilometers away from the epicenter. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=68.44s)]
*  Normally, we won't see the significant damage, but in this case, you see the damage. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=74.16s)]
*  Pretty much you can see most high-rise buildings. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=80.36s)]
*  This is one of the cases I can see in earthquake engineering, with so-called side effects, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=83.16s)]
*  because Bangkok is set on a thick, soft sediment. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=88.68s)]
*  So because that sediment really amplifies those frequencies, ground motion energy really [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=94.72000000000001s)]
*  causes the building shake much harder. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=102.76s)]
*  High-rise buildings shake harder. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=105.56s)]
*  You can see that's what happened there. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=107.12s)]
*  What hazards do Myanmar and Thailandians need to watch out for now in the aftermath of this? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=110.56s)]
*  I think it's really important for people, particularly in the Myanmar area, particularly [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=116.12s)]
*  in the epicenter area. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=123.16s)]
*  All people can do, I think right now, just immediately leave the old house because aftershocks [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=126.12s)]
*  will come in, particularly in the area, like the rural area. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=131.76s)]
*  Their house is very shaky. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=136.36s)]
*  You can see on the screen, all the new is all this mortar. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=137.92s)]
*  It's really not good earthquake resistance structures. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=143.28s)]
*  So they are very dangerous. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=147.56s)]
*  They should move out right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Jemi Wong, thank you for your time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJxpwwlCvx0&t=156.04000000000002s)]
