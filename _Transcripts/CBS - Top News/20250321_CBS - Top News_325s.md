# Venezuelan official likens deportations to El Salvador prison to start of "concentration camp"
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY)
*  We are learning more about the 238 Venezuelan men that the Trump [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=0.0s)]
*  administration recently deported to El Salvador. The Trump [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=4.7s)]
*  administration claims all of them are connected to Venezuelan [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=8.3s)]
*  gangs, but has not provided any evidence to that. Venezuela's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=11.8s)]
*  interior minister said on a podcast today that quote, none [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=16.0s)]
*  of the men are tied to a Venezuelan gang. Also saying [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=19.6s)]
*  what's happening in El Salvador is the establishment of a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=23.1s)]
*  concentration camp. Anyone who agrees with what the US and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=27.4s)]
*  El Salvador are doing is a barbarian. Let's bring in CBS [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=31.6s)]
*  News immigration and politics reporter Camila Montoya Calves. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=35.5s)]
*  Camila, we also understand we have a list of names of those [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=38.4s)]
*  men who were deported. What do you know? Hi Liz. Yes, we [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=42.2s)]
*  obtained the entire list of everyone who was sent to El [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=46.5s)]
*  Salvador last weekend from Venezuela and we know that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=50.9s)]
*  there are about 230 deportees on this list, specifically 238 [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=54.7s)]
*  Venezuelan men who were deported from the US and many of them [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=61.1s)]
*  were actually expelled from the country under the Alien Enemies [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=66.3s)]
*  Act of 1798. That is that wartime legal authority that the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=70.10000000000001s)]
*  Trump administration has cited to try to summarily arrest and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=74.9s)]
*  detain Venezuelan migrants here in the US who are allegedly [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=80.2s)]
*  part of this Tren de Aragua transnational gang, but that is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=84.6s)]
*  of course now at the subject of not only a legal fight in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  federal court with the judge barring these removals for the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=92.5s)]
*  time being and also asking the Justice Department whether the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=96.1s)]
*  administration knowingly defied his order to turn around the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  deportation planes last weekend, but it has also now turned into [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  a broader fight between the administration, the US government [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=109.0s)]
*  and the relatives and lawyers of these deportees Liz because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=113.9s)]
*  while the administration is accusing these 238 men of being [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  part of this notorious transnational organization, their lawyers [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=122.7s)]
*  and relatives say that they are non-criminal migrants who were [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=127.4s)]
*  in some cases, yes in the US illegally, but were not part of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=131.9s)]
*  any criminal organization and the US government has said that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  not everyone on those deportation flights had criminal records, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=139.4s)]
*  but they have said that everyone was part of Tren de Aragua, which [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=143.4s)]
*  is of course an accusation Liz that now the relatives and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=147.1s)]
*  Venezuelan government is disputing. Yeah, they're saying there's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=150.8s)]
*  no evidence to prove that so any idea Camilo of how they're [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=153.8s)]
*  identifying these individuals and arresting them or taking them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=157.70000000000002s)]
*  into custody and then sending them on that plane any idea of [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=161.9s)]
*  how they're finding them is it through social media? That really [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=165.5s)]
*  is a critical question in this story Liz. We know according [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=169.3s)]
*  to one sworn declaration by a current top ICE official that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=173.3s)]
*  the government relies on a variety of techniques to identify [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=177.8s)]
*  migrants in deportation proceedings as potential or suspected [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  gang members. One of those techniques relies on looking at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=186.8s)]
*  international and domestic criminal databases for intelligence [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=190.60000000000002s)]
*  or criminal records that suggests that somebody may be part [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=195.0s)]
*  of a gang. They also rely on interviews with current or former [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=198.4s)]
*  gang members as well as the victims of potential gang members [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=202.2s)]
*  to make these accusations, but yes, they also rely Liz heavily [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=205.6s)]
*  on tattoos and social media activity that the migrants have [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  or have posted online and so that is what is really concerning [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=216.1s)]
*  to the relatives of the deportees and other advocates who say [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=220.2s)]
*  that this is a slippery slope to try to identify migrant gang [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=225.0s)]
*  members, potential migrant gang members through tattoos because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=229.3s)]
*  as you know tattoos don't necessarily imply that somebody is in [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=233.0s)]
*  a gang. So this is something that will continue to be contested [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=236.9s)]
*  in not only federal court but now on the world stage as this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=240.3s)]
*  story continues to garner international attention. Yeah, Camila [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=244.3s)]
*  I want to pivot to another immigration story. Migrant flights [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=248.10000000000002s)]
*  to Guantanamo Bay have resumed. Last week the Trump administration [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=251.5s)]
*  quote emptied out the facility as they say. What can you tell us [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  about the back and forth between this? Two US officials tell [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=258.8s)]
*  CBS News that the Trump administration has indeed received migrant [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=263.3s)]
*  detainee flights to the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=268.5s)]
*  that base of course is now at the center of this effort by the [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=273.0s)]
*  Trump administration to convert that facility there into a massive [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  detention center. President Trump has talked about housing as [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=281.8s)]
*  many as 30,000 migrant detainees at Guantanamo Bay that of course [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=285.2s)]
*  has not materialized but the administration but the administration [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=290.4s)]
*  rather has housed several hundred detainees there. Most of them [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=293.9s)]
*  have been deported to their home countries or have been transferred [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=297.8s)]
*  to the US mainland. As you noted last week the administration [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=301.0s)]
*  emptied out the holding facilities but now there are a new group [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=304.8s)]
*  of migrants, new groups of migrants I should say at that facility. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=309.2s)]
*  There was a plane yesterday that carried about 21 detainees and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=312.8s)]
*  we are told that more planes are on the way this week. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=316.8s)]
*  All right, CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camila Montoya [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  Villalves. Thank you so much Camila. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8tTy0BnBGY&t=323.70000000000005s)]
