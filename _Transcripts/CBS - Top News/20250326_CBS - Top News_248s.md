# What we know about Trump's executive order to overhaul U.S. elections
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE)
*  President Donald Trump putting his signature on another executive order. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=0.0s)]
*  This time he's hoping to change how Americans go to the polls. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=8.96s)]
*  The order would require voters to show proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=13.48s)]
*  and mandate all ballots must be received by election day or they will not be counted. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=18.68s)]
*  CBS News justice correspondent Scott McFarlane has been covering this for us today. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=25.0s)]
*  Scott, can you talk about these changes and what they could mean for us the next time we go to the polls? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=28.72s)]
*  This executive order risks getting lost in the shuffle of all the other orders coming out and all the other news, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=35.44s)]
*  but we've heard from some secretaries of state, we've heard some election experts who say this is some pretty striking stuff [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=40.96s)]
*  which could have untold impacts on the next election. The next federal election is 2026. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  Among the things called for in this executive order would be a citizenship proof for somebody to vote [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=54.16s)]
*  in a federal election. It could call for the decertification or recertification of voting systems, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  you know, the actual thing you vote in in many states. It could strip funding for elections from [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=66.72s)]
*  some states and it could have an impact on when ballots are accepted. A call here in this executive [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=72.88s)]
*  order to not accept any ballots that are submitted on time but not received after election day. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=78.64s)]
*  You're talking about something Liz here which gets into the local and state election administration, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=86.0s)]
*  something the president may not have any ability to affect. So this appears destined to go to the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=91.68s)]
*  courts and into lawsuits, but in the meantime there's concern this could cede faceless challenges [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=96.56s)]
*  to the 2026 election or the ability of some states, potentially blue states, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=103.2s)]
*  to do all the things they're supposed to do to hold and complete those elections. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=108.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm thinking of the ramifications for the Red Star voters in so many of these cities as well [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=113.36s)]
*  as the postal service, the pressure on them to get the votes in on time, especially those mail-in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=118.08s)]
*  ballots. Now President Trump's insists these changes will preserve election integrity, but [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=122.72s)]
*  your sources are saying that's far from the case. What are you hearing? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=127.68s)]
*  Well some of that is built on a baseless foundation that there's widespread [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=131.76000000000002s)]
*  undocumented immigrant voting in federal elections. There's been no evidence of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=136.88000000000002s)]
*  widespread undocumented immigrant voting in federal elections, so if that is the cause [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=140.72s)]
*  for this executive order it's built on a faulty foundation. That's the first concern. The other [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  concern is this, that the courts seem inevitably set to weigh in on this. This is going to go to [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  court. Lawsuits are imminent and in fact I've heard from the Pennsylvania secretary of state, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  a democrat, who says that President Trump does not have the ability or the power to get involved [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=161.2s)]
*  with those local decisions. That's notwithstanding. If the lawsuits succeed in stopping this executive [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=167.12s)]
*  order, there is a concern that the failure to execute these executive orders could give the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=172.4s)]
*  president reason to discourage people to vote in the 2026 election or could try to discredit [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=177.28s)]
*  the results of that election. We saw the result of some a similar effort in 2020. Another element [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=185.92s)]
*  to this story Scott is the price. What's all this going to cost? What could it cost taxpayers [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  for states to implement these sweeping changes? Some of these changes aren't just required before [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=199.04s)]
*  the 2026 election. Some of these changes could be required within 180 days. We're talking about [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=205.11999999999998s)]
*  something that is just months away. A deadline that may not be reachable no matter when you set [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=211.12s)]
*  that deadline. Let's put that aside for a moment. What's also in jeopardy here, if states don't make [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=216.0s)]
*  the changes required in this executive order, is possibly federal funding. They could lose money [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=221.12s)]
*  if they don't adhere to what Donald Trump wants them to do with their election systems. That's a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=226.48000000000002s)]
*  problem for states that require and rely upon federal money to do the very big thing of staging [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=231.6s)]
*  federal elections in every community in America. CBSU's Justice Correspondent Scott McFarland [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=238.4s)]
*  for us in Washington. Thank you so much Scott. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVmXDt9mXE&t=245.76000000000002s)]
