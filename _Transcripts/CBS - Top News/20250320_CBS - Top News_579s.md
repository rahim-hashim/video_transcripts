# What come next after Trump calls with Zelenskyy and Putin
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY)
*  The White House described President Trump's conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=0.0s)]
*  as, quote, fantastic. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=3.64s)]
*  But there are still a number of differences between Washington, Moscow and Kiev following [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=5.44s)]
*  Trump's calls this week. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=9.36s)]
*  Just moments ago, Zelensky gave a press conference in Norway where he was asked about the American [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  proposals. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=15.64s)]
*  Let's watch coverage from the BBC. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=16.64s)]
*  We want to end the war. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=20.52s)]
*  So who will argue with that? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Let's then make certain steps faster. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  During the meeting in Jeddah, the American party made a leap forward, a rapid step forward, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  and they said, let's speak not about the partial ceasefire, but about the full ceasefire. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=34.2s)]
*  We reacted immediately right at that meeting. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=39.8s)]
*  We reacted. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=42.2s)]
*  My team reached out to me because that was the change of agenda with which they arrived [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=43.2s)]
*  there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=48.28s)]
*  And I said immediately, we approve. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=49.28s)]
*  We confirm. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=51.44s)]
*  We confirm. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=52.44s)]
*  We want to move to the end of the war. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=53.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=55.52s)]
*  Everybody was very happy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=56.6s)]
*  I want to bring in Nina Khrushcheva. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=58.6s)]
*  She is a professor at the Julian J. Studley Graduate Program of International Affairs [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=60.56s)]
*  at the New School. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  And she also happens to be the great granddaughter of former leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=66.64s)]
*  Khrushchev. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=71.12s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us, Professor, as always. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=72.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=75.72s)]
*  So political leaders can say all they want, but these negotiations will be handled by [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=76.72s)]
*  technical teams to work through the details. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=82.48s)]
*  How difficult of a challenge will that be? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=85.22s)]
*  Well, we're already seeing that it's a very difficult challenge because Donald Trump seems [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=87.42s)]
*  to be mediator between Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=94.82s)]
*  And so far, it's going slow. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=99.74s)]
*  Somebody agrees on something and somebody else doesn't agree. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=104.86s)]
*  So now they have technical teams. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=107.34s)]
*  Technical teams can decide on certain articles of those agreements. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=109.9s)]
*  But then these articles of those agreements still go back to the top guys. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=115.10000000000001s)]
*  And the top guys may still say, well, but why didn't you consider this and this and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=118.98s)]
*  something else? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=123.26s)]
*  And so, so far, it's going slower. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=124.58000000000001s)]
*  And even if the ceasefire seems to be closer to what it was, say, two weeks ago, it's still [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=127.18s)]
*  far away from being closed. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=134.68s)]
*  And also, we do know that both sides keep shooting at each other, never mind that they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=137.34s)]
*  already agreed that at least the infrastructure, the electric and gas and other crucial infrastructure [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=141.9s)]
*  should be part of the ceasefire. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=152.38s)]
*  So far, we're still in the process of moving. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=156.08s)]
*  But the end is no, at least the way it looks today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=159.46s)]
*  We really do not know when the ceasefire and if it does, when it does come. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=166.14s)]
*  So certainly, President Trump should be applauded for at least getting these two leaders to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  the negotiating table, to at least getting to a point where there is communication between [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=177.29999999999998s)]
*  Moscow and Washington and there is some movement. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=184.06s)]
*  But I wonder, when I hear partial ceasefire, then I see what Vladimir Putin is demanding, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  which is essentially that the United States stop supplying arms to Ukraine, that Ukraine [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=194.10000000000002s)]
*  stand down its military, that they do not entertain ever the idea of entering NATO. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=199.02s)]
*  Then I wonder to myself, well, what is Vladimir Putin giving up? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  What's your analysis of it? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=206.82000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is giving up not going further, potentially. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=208.82000000000002s)]
*  And I think that NATO membership is kind of a really interesting question here, because [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  behind the closed doors, NATO member countries almost all agree that Ukraine potentially [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=222.9s)]
*  would never become part of NATO. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=231.26s)]
*  We don't know, because who knows what's going to happen in 2050, whatever, 100 years. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=232.98000000000002s)]
*  But so far, they all agree on that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=239.22s)]
*  And yet there is sort of a story that no, Ukraine needs to decide. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=240.74s)]
*  So that hypocrisy, in fact, does help Putin, because he says, well, you're hypocrites. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=244.76s)]
*  Why are you then pushing? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  So it means that you're pushing for the war. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=252.16s)]
*  So that's basically a no-starter. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=254.68s)]
*  For Putin to give up, he can, and he already says that. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=257.64s)]
*  He said it a couple of months ago, is that, for example, the two are the very main cities [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=261.28s)]
*  that the Russians want to get. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  It's Odessa and Kharkiv. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=268.24s)]
*  These are the cities that now under the control of Ukraine and should stay there. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=270.12s)]
*  So Putin is basically saying, I am staying with wherever we have today. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=274.04s)]
*  But then what we have to discuss is that Odessa and Kharkiv are not going to be part [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=279.88s)]
*  of Russian advances. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=285.84s)]
*  So he thinks he gives quite a lot. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=289.32s)]
*  That is, he can continue to go further. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=291.92s)]
*  It's going to be a long war, a war of attrition, which Russia is likely to win, because Ukraine [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=294.8s)]
*  doesn't have the power unless Europe gets into that war completely. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=299.64s)]
*  Well, now Ukraine gets what is left of Ukraine, is not going to become NATO. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=305.48s)]
*  And that's your decision to make. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=312.16s)]
*  So he thinks he's in quite a strong position to make this demand that, of course, for Ukrainians, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  seem like an improbable proposition. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=319.36s)]
*  So, all right, Professor. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Let's look at it from that standpoint, which is that the Ukrainians, despite the consternations, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=323.88s)]
*  will have to agree that whatever territory was lost during Putin's incursion and invasion [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=331.56s)]
*  is lost forever, at least as far as—as long as Vladimir Putin is the leader of Russia. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=337.08s)]
*  And so the only question then would be, what would prevent—and Vladimir Putin agrees to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=342.32s)]
*  it—but what would then prevent Putin from doing this again? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=349.68s)]
*  And maybe not to Ukraine, but to another country on his flank? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=353.26s)]
*  That's, I think, the biggest question for just those of us here in the United States, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=359.24s)]
*  and I'm sure Europe as well. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=362.12s)]
*  Fine, Ukraine has to sort of suck it up and agree that those territories are gone. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=363.8s)]
*  But what guarantees do they and other Eastern European states have that Vladimir Putin won't [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=370.36s)]
*  do this again, given that he will have won what territory that he took, which was during [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=375.56s)]
*  an illegal war? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=380.82s)]
*  That's a fantastic question, which we do not have an answer to. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=382.28s)]
*  I am almost certain that Vladimir Putin doesn't have an answer to it, because he would say [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=387.08000000000004s)]
*  for now that, OK, fine, we technically won this war. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=391.88s)]
*  I got as far as I could have gotten, and I'm going to stop. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  It is a question that nobody has an answer, and maybe, as I said, maybe even himself, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=402.36s)]
*  because it will depend on further developments of diplomatic or any other relations, is that, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=408.56s)]
*  what if in a year he would say, well, Moldova doesn't sit well, so I think I'm just going [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  to go and make sure that Romania is not taking Moldova over, or something like that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=419.12s)]
*  But this is, I mean, this question is very important, but since nobody has an answer [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=425.4s)]
*  to it, it should not really prevent any diplomatic efforts that people are trying to make today. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=432.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's an excellent point, which is that I certainly thought that, for example, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=437.8s)]
*  Putin may have designs on Moldova, but the way that he would approach it would be by [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=443.52s)]
*  suggesting that Romania is somehow a threat to Moldova and that the Russians are going [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=447.42s)]
*  to protect the Moldovans from the West and from Romanian or European aggression. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=452.4s)]
*  I guess the only question then becomes, do we have, can we, is it fair or unfair to use [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=460.0s)]
*  a historical antecedent, which is Adolf Hitler's incursions into the Sudetenland and into Czechoslovakia, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=465.4s)]
*  and being able to do that, and then the understanding from the European powers being, OK, that's [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=473.28s)]
*  it, but that really wasn't it, as we all know. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=478.68s)]
*  Is it fair to say that there are similar antecedents or not fair? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=481.2s)]
*  Well, people make this connection quite often, and it's, in fact, very popular to do that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=485.76s)]
*  I am very careful using history as a kind of explanation for current events, because [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=492.48s)]
*  I think that when we start directly comparing past to the present, we limit ourselves with [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  a contemporary analysis, because we think, well, because it happened in 1939, it must [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=507.91999999999996s)]
*  be happening in 2025. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=513.84s)]
*  Maybe yes, maybe no, but once again, what's the policy? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=516.36s)]
*  So fine, you compare, you think it is what the case is. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Lh8LZ3nWY&t=520.4s)]
