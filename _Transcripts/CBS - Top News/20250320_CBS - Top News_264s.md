# Why AOC, Sanders are making stops in U.S. for "Fighting Oligarchy" tour
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg)
*  The Democratic Party has been facing growing backlash and calls for a new leader as it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=0.0s)]
*  tries to find its footing in the new Trump administration, especially after last week's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=5.14s)]
*  government spending showdown. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=9.32s)]
*  And two prominent progressives are now taking that momentum on the road. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=11.38s)]
*  So starting today, Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Independent [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=14.86s)]
*  Senator Bernie Sanders are hosting rallies in Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado to highlight [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=19.54s)]
*  the base's anger, ramp up support in their fight against what they are calling the oligarchy [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=25.56s)]
*  taking shape in Washington. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Jamie Harrison, spoke to CBS News [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=33.26s)]
*  about the need for the party to come together. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=37.04s)]
*  If you don't have all the votes yourself in order to get the legislation done, then that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=39.32s)]
*  means you've got to build a coalition in order to do that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=44.28s)]
*  And you know, for Democrats, we got to let Republicans, if they can't do it, let them [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=48.12s)]
*  own all of this mess that they have created. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=54.080000000000005s)]
*  CBS News political correspondent Nidia Cavazos is in Las Vegas where AOC and Sanders will [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  rally today. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  Great to have you on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=65.92s)]
*  I have to ask you, I mean, AOC, she's always been outspoken, leading to some division among [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=66.92s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=72.88s)]
*  She voiced her frustration with Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer after he allowed the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=73.88s)]
*  GOP's funding bill to advance and has been very vocal about pushing back against the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=77.68s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=82.88s)]
*  But what's your read? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=83.88s)]
*  Could she be the new face of the movement? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=85.52s)]
*  And that's exactly the question that many are asking. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  Is AOC going to be the new face to this movement or will also other Democratic leaders, especially [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=93.56s)]
*  on Capitol Hill, also join her in this movement? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  And of course, there's also much speculation as to whether AOC is also setting herself [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  up for a potential future run. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=106.46s)]
*  But what we do know for a fact today is that she is joining Senator Bernie Sanders for [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=108.88s)]
*  multiple stops as part of the Fighting Oligarchy Tour. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=113.68s)]
*  And of course, this is a reference to President Trump and his adviser, Elon Musk. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=117.2s)]
*  They're out here, especially in swing districts that are currently being represented by Republicans [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=121.48s)]
*  on Capitol Hill to make sure that their message and how to fight back is getting to thousands [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=127.08s)]
*  and thousands of people. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=132.08s)]
*  Right now, we're seeing that this line of people who have been waiting here for a couple [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=133.6s)]
*  of hours does stretch a good distance here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=137.24s)]
*  And so we are hearing from people on the ground that they are excited to hear what is exactly [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=140.88s)]
*  their message. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=145.76s)]
*  How are they going to be fighting back? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=146.76s)]
*  And both AOC and Senator Sanders have made it clear that they feel that not enough is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  being done on Capitol Hill to address the policies, the executive actions and what's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=153.06s)]
*  been coming out of the Trump's White House lately. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=157.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point you make. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=160.12s)]
*  There are quite a number of people in the background of your shot. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=162.0s)]
*  I'm glad that you pointed that out. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=164.8s)]
*  I just want to get your take. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  In a New York Times interview, Senator Sanders has suggested more progressives join him and [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=167.48000000000002s)]
*  run as independents. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=172.52s)]
*  What kind of implications could that have for the Democratic Party? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=174.68s)]
*  What is clear is that the Democratic Party has been struggling to unite behind a similar [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=180.56s)]
*  message where all of its factions in the party, to the more progressive base, to the more [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=185.56s)]
*  moderate, actually agree and know how to counter Trump. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=189.44s)]
*  And so what this means is that Senator Sanders and AOC are being receptive to what American [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=193.04s)]
*  voters are saying. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=198.28s)]
*  And now, Nevada, it's important to note that this is a state that President Trump won in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  2024. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=204.6s)]
*  And so he did it with the support of many minorities. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  You have your Hispanic, your Black voters, and as well as different minorities who supported [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=208.94s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  And this is because they continuously expressed on the trail that they were in a certain discontent [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  with the status of the economy, with immigration at the border, and they wanted to see change. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=222.24s)]
*  And so AOC and Sanders have made it clear that change is necessary. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  And this is what they're trying to do today as they address these voters who also identify [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=231.96s)]
*  as progressives. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=236.0s)]
*  And really quick, Nidhi, I've got about 30 seconds. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=237.0s)]
*  Moderate Democrats, what's their game plan? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  We've seen moderate Democrats take on several stops doing their town halls because they're [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=245.04000000000002s)]
*  trying again to show that they're receptive to what they're asking for, for what their [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=251.12s)]
*  constituents are saying, and that they're also ready to fight back against Trump's White [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  House. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=259.8s)]
*  Well, we will continue watching, as will you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=260.8s)]
*  Nidhi Akabazos, thank you. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFtS4IDHchg&t=262.48s)]
