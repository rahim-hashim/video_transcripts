# Black Veterans Project co-founder weighs in on Pentagon's DEI purge
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for staying with us. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=1.0s)]
*  The Defense Department, under considerable scrutiny and a little bit of pressure, has [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=2.0s)]
*  restored pages across its websites and social media platforms that were deleted during a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=5.76s)]
*  widespread purge of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion content. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=11.48s)]
*  Among those deleted was an article recognizing the military career of baseball legend Jackie [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=16.04s)]
*  Robinson, who was drafted during World War II. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=22.04s)]
*  The Defense Department also, for a brief period of time, purged, then restored, web pages [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=25.32s)]
*  about Navajo code talkers, Tuskegee Airmen, Marines at Iwo Jima and much more. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=31.32s)]
*  It released a statement Friday saying, quote, some content was archived that should not [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=36.84s)]
*  have been. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=43.36s)]
*  That word archived is much more benign than actually occurred. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=44.36s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=48.8s)]
*  Richard Brookshire joins me now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=50.28s)]
*  He is the co-founder of the Black Veterans Project, which works to support both active [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=51.64s)]
*  and retired black service members. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=56.72s)]
*  Richard, thanks for being here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=58.64s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=59.8s)]
*  How much do you feel this Jackie Robinson saga of recent vintage is a prism into this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  entire effort by the Trump Department of Defense to rewrite or whitewash history within that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  institution? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=76.0s)]
*  I mean, you think he's surmised it perfectly. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=77.0s)]
*  I think what's happening is part of the intention to deconstruct diversity, equity and inclusion [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=78.88000000000001s)]
*  programs and practices that took decades to build to foster some level of inclusion, some [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=86.28s)]
*  level of equitable access for the black community. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=92.0s)]
*  When you talk about the military, which undergirds such a large portion of our economy, right? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=96.28s)]
*  And the disparities that have persisted in the military are quite telling. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=102.72s)]
*  I think this particular historical erasure, and not all the webpages have been restored. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=105.72s)]
*  Many of them have been lost forever. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=111.4s)]
*  There's also talks over the weekend that there is going to be a deliberate purge of anything [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=113.76s)]
*  that has to do with historical firsts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=118.44s)]
*  So you're erasing context, right? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=120.44s)]
*  The fact that many of these black service members served under a particular racial order [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=122.0s)]
*  in this country that we've been trying to write a historical wrong about for many years [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=127.44s)]
*  and have only begun to really make strides about that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=132.24s)]
*  I think, lastly, I think it's important to talk about some surveys that were done in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=136.32000000000002s)]
*  recent years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=140.36s)]
*  In 2017, there was the only time that the Department of Defense released a racial equity [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=141.36s)]
*  survey that they do internally every two years. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=146.72s)]
*  Reuters reported on that, and it said that one in every three black service members were [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=149.32000000000002s)]
*  experiencing racial discrimination or harassment in uniform. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Reuters did a survey, said that half of minority veterans were seeing racial animus and prejudice [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=156.16s)]
*  while in uniform, while in service, and a full one-third of all troops were seeing [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  ideologically driven racism in the ranks, right? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=169.48s)]
*  This administration is trying to deliberately undermine the fact that these findings were [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=172.6s)]
*  found. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=177.5s)]
*  In the last administration, you had the appointment of two black men to lead the Department of [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=178.5s)]
*  Defense, and that was met with ire by certain folks in the Department of Defense. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=184.0s)]
*  We didn't have a public dialogue about the ways in which their leadership was being subverted, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=187.8s)]
*  and now you have a full court press by the Trump administration to not only deconstruct [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=192.4s)]
*  DEI, but to really just attack the service, the historical service and continued service [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=196.88s)]
*  of black service members. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=203.8s)]
*  Richard, you mentioned that 2017 survey, but if you Google information about that, you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=204.8s)]
*  see the Reuters exclusive with a date of 2021 indicating that the Pentagon sat on [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=208.84s)]
*  it for years. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=214.16s)]
*  It sat on it for years, yes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=215.16s)]
*  We were the ones that worked with Reuters to try to get them to bring it to light, right? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=216.8s)]
*  We still haven't been able to get any of the other years of survey data. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=220.88s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=224.16s)]
*  The question is really why. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=225.6s)]
*  What are they trying to hide? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=226.88s)]
*  Why is there a lack of- [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=227.88s)]
*  Is it an answer itself? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=228.88s)]
*  That's an answer within itself, yes, because there continues to be a race problem within [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=229.88s)]
*  the body of our military that is deeply unfortunate. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=234.32s)]
*  Within that survey and the other ones you mentioned, not only are there statistical [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=238.12s)]
*  information, is there statistical information about experiencing some manner of racial discrimination, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=243.4s)]
*  but a fear that if you bring anyone's attention to it, you will hamper your advancement. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=254.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, look at the fact that the Trump administration released a directive with hundreds [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  of words to try to sanitize the ways in which people can even talk about the issues that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  we're discussing right now. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=263.88s)]
*  That within itself, to me, is a clear attempt at trying to subvert any kind of effort to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=266.08s)]
*  even make this reality something that can be contended with, because you can just label [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=273.44s)]
*  it DEI, which they've co-opted the language around to begin with. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  Everything that has to do with race is suddenly DEI or identity politics, and so it should [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=284.32s)]
*  be discarded. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  And then you look like folks like General Brown, who came out publicly after the George [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Floyd protests and said that he spoke about his lived experiences with racial discrimination [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=294.36s)]
*  in the military, the barriers that he had to overcome, the things that he still had [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=299.2s)]
*  to deal with as a black man in America. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=302.84s)]
*  That was part and parcel of the reason why he was purged from the DOD. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=304.48s)]
*  And all this is done under the explanation of improving lethality, unit cohesion, and [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=309.82s)]
*  general unity within the military. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=317.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=319.32s)]
*  That's a misnomer, because you can't possibly say that you want unit cohesion while trying [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=320.36s)]
*  to undermine, trying to subvert, trying to discard literally hundreds of thousands of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=325.4s)]
*  black minority service members. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=331.76s)]
*  You can't do that while you're also attacking women in the military, LGBTQ folks, folks [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=333.98s)]
*  who are highly skilled, folks who bring a deep passion and love of country to their [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=338.6s)]
*  service, and to pretend as though that because of their identity, suddenly that their lethality [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=343.12s)]
*  and uniform is somewhat in question is an insult to them in their service. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  Richard Brookshire, I appreciate you coming in. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=353.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=355.84s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNIVHUQPYo4&t=356.84s)]
