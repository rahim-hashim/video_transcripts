# Maryland Gov. Wes Moore honors Key Bridge victims 1 year after collapse
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU)
*  break that we felt to learn that six remarkable Marylanders who had been working while we [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=0.0s)]
*  slept, six patriots who endured the rattling of cars and trucks so the rest of us could [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=9.28s)]
*  be safe, that they were now unaccounted for. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=18.66s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=25.16s)]
*  That was Maryland Governor Wes Moore marking one year since Baltimore's Key Bridge collapsed [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=26.32s)]
*  because it was struck by a large cargo vessel called the Dolly that lost control because [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=30.92s)]
*  it ran out of power. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=36.44s)]
*  Six construction workers who were on that bridge at the time lost their lives. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=38.32s)]
*  Their family members were among those who took part in today's memorial. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=43.08s)]
*  I want to bring in Nicole Skanga who joins us from Baltimore and spoke with Governor [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Moore. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=50.8s)]
*  Nicole, what did he tell you and what is the sense there one year after this terrific tragedy? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, just yesterday Major, the Governor had dinners with the families of the six victims, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=58.4s)]
*  Alejandro, Dorleon, Minor, Miguel, Jose, Carlos, all of them immigrants aging from 26 to 49 [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=65.56s)]
*  years old. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=73.96s)]
*  And Governor Moore and I spoke about conversations we had with one man in particular, Moises [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=74.96s)]
*  Diaz was a member of that construction crew. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=81.36s)]
*  He was meant to be on the bridge that night when it collapsed, but due to a last minute [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  shift change was not. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  And he told me that in the days and weeks preceding the collapse, individuals who were [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  driving past that construction crew would roll down their windows and say out loud, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=95.76s)]
*  go back to Mexico and scream other profanities at the crew. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=101.08s)]
*  And I asked the Governor if he was concerned that perhaps this reflected a larger sentiment [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=105.14s)]
*  held not only in Baltimore, but across the country. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=110.16000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=114.0s)]
*  I think this country unfortunately needs a reminder that we are we are tied and we're [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=115.0s)]
*  unified and we need each other. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  And and when we're having all these large conversations, national conversations, and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=125.4s)]
*  I have said publicly and I still will continue to say that, yes, do we need to have no immigration [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=130.12s)]
*  reform and do we need Congress to do their job and act on it? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=135.72s)]
*  One hundred percent we do. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=138.8s)]
*  And we also can never forget our humanity and we can never forget the things that also [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  makes this country strong. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=145.12s)]
*  And and Major, it reminded me of a question you posed one year ago that struck me so much. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=146.32s)]
*  I wrote it down, whether the deaths of these six men may begin to dislodge the rapid [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=153.36s)]
*  contemporary reflex to scorn those who come to America to work, to flee violence, to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=159.8s)]
*  find a better life, to turn shovels and fill potholes while we warmly sleep. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=165.44s)]
*  I'm not sure if we have an answer to that question a year later, but I know it's something [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  top of mind for the governor and many who have paid tribute to these victims today. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=175.16s)]
*  And Nicole, what is the status of the port traffic, commercial and otherwise, and the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=180.84s)]
*  bridge reconstruction itself? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=187.44s)]
*  Major, it was important to the governor today that Baltimore speak in one voice. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=189.8s)]
*  This new bridge is expected to be put up in twenty twenty eight. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=196.76s)]
*  And, you know, late December is when that federal spending bill was passed in Congress [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=201.72s)]
*  in order to federally fund this bridge. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=208.88s)]
*  I asked him if this administration has given him reassurances that that will be a good [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  has given him reassurances that that will indeed happen despite all of the focus and [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=216.67999999999998s)]
*  emphasis on cutting back. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  He said he was reassured of that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  And he also told me that it was important for Maryland to put a united front as he sort [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=226.23999999999998s)]
*  of tried to lead through this chaotic time in a divided America. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=231.6s)]
*  Take a listen. What has this past year taught you about how to lead in a divided America? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=235.07999999999998s)]
*  Um, you need to lead with humanity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=245.28s)]
*  Never forget the people who are impacted most on this. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  And it's those six families that we have to make big goals and then put together plans [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  and actually achieving them. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=257.96s)]
*  And we have to stand united. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=260.0s)]
*  You know, I'm a I'm an army guy and I'm a combat vet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=262.16s)]
*  The thing that I learned in combat was that the only certainty is uncertainty. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=265.92s)]
*  Things are going to change. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=270.52s)]
*  And so you have to be prepared and moving together. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  And throughout all of our conversation, major, we kept coming back to the families, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  the governor making it clear he wants them at the center of the bridge collapse [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=282.08s)]
*  commemoration today and also this rebuild. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=287.0s)]
*  Major Nicole Skanga, an important day, an important interview. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDAS7al5WU&t=293.91999999999996s)]
