# Israeli officials furious over Trump administration Signal group chat leak
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q)
*  CBS News has learned Israeli officials are furious over the leak of a signal group chat [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  discussing military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=5.36s)]
*  A senior U.S. intel official with knowledge of the situation says the chat involving top [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=8.84s)]
*  administration officials compromised an Israeli intelligence source who provided the location [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=13.74s)]
*  for the target and the attack. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=18.66s)]
*  CBS News national security contributor Sam Benigrad joins us now for this and other national [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=20.48s)]
*  security headlines. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=25.34s)]
*  So Sam, now that we know the signal chat is affecting U.S. relations with allies, what [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=26.46s)]
*  do you make of this? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=30.14s)]
*  Well, as a general matter, Lindsay, the United States depends on intelligence relationships [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=31.14s)]
*  with foreign partners like Israel to get access to information that we would not necessarily [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=36.82s)]
*  have. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=43.019999999999996s)]
*  In particular, in regions where other partners might have a greater presence or more intelligence [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=44.019999999999996s)]
*  assets, those partners' intelligence is critical to, for example, engaging and targeting operations. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  The fact that Israeli intelligence may have become public as part of this signal chat [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=55.56s)]
*  could really damage ongoing intelligence cooperation between the United States and Israel, as well [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=62.2s)]
*  as between the United States and other intelligence partners who now have reason to think that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=69.28s)]
*  the U.S. may be callous with sensitive intelligence. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=74.52000000000001s)]
*  All of our intelligence partners are very focused on safeguarding their own sources [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=77.72s)]
*  and methods. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=81.96s)]
*  And this whole incident, I fear, could have a chilling effect on intelligence sharing [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=82.96s)]
*  because of the callousness with which the national security adviser and the secretary [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=87.58s)]
*  of defense treated sensitive information that it turns out may not have even been ours. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=91.72s)]
*  So those are the reverberations among our foreign allies. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=98.11999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk reverberations domestically. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=100.91999999999999s)]
*  The New York Times spoke to a dozen Air Force and Navy fighter pilots who said, going forward, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=102.72s)]
*  they can no longer be certain the Pentagon is focused on their safety when they strap [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=107.0s)]
*  into cockpits and that the inadvertent invitation to the journalist, as well as Secretary Hegson's [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=110.6s)]
*  assistants, he did nothing wrong by disclosing military plans in the chat. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=115.32s)]
*  Upend decades of military doctrine about operational security. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=119.52s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=124.0s)]
*  Well, let's just keep in mind why information is deemed classified or sensitive in the first [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=125.0s)]
*  place. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=130.51999999999998s)]
*  It's because its unauthorized disclosure could cause harm to U.S. national security. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  That is exactly why operational security plans, in my experience, are solely discussed and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=137.17999999999998s)]
*  communicated about on classified or sensitive platforms in very specific communications [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=143.33999999999997s)]
*  channels and even very specific rooms. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=149.66s)]
*  The fact that this information was out there in an encrypted but not classified communications [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=152.73999999999998s)]
*  channel means that a range of bad actors could have gotten information about U.S. troop locations, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=158.01999999999998s)]
*  U.S. military assets and more before these strikes occurred. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=165.3s)]
*  That could have put U.S. service members directly in harm's way. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=169.26s)]
*  And because Secretary of Defense Hegseth is failing to acknowledge that this is a misstep, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=174.82s)]
*  I do think it's sending a message within the Pentagon that he does not consider operational [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=179.06s)]
*  security requirements in the same way that his predecessors did. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=183.9s)]
*  So at that point, that is likely the reason that U.S. service members are concerned about [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=188.26s)]
*  their own safety and operational security going forward. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=192.82s)]
*  Sam, I also want to ask you about this because Vice President-Advanced and National Security [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=195.5s)]
*  Advisor Walz were in mineral-rich Greenland today and the Vice President told members [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=199.34s)]
*  of the press that Russia and China are definitely interested in Greenland and that Greenlanders [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=203.7s)]
*  will be more secure under American rule. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=207.64s)]
*  They also said our friends in Denmark having done their job in keeping this area safe. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=210.01999999999998s)]
*  Are there national security concerns here? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, there are, but just legally speaking, it's not really up to the Vice President as [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=218.34s)]
*  to whether the people of Greenland would or would not be better off under U.S. sovereignty [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=223.5s)]
*  or some sort of U.S. partnership with the United States. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=228.86s)]
*  When it comes to Greenland, Lindsay, it's about location, location, location. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=231.5s)]
*  Greenland is the largest island in the world. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  It is located between two oceans, the Atlantic and the Arctic, and two continents, Europe [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  and the United States. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  It is critical to maintaining access to key shipping lanes in the Arctic, which reduce [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=245.16s)]
*  shipping times by over 40% versus other trade routes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=250.56s)]
*  It is critical to intercepting missiles if they're fired from Russia, for example, towards [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=254.28s)]
*  the United States. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=259.48s)]
*  And overall, it is certainly location-wise at a key point when it comes to trying to [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=260.48s)]
*  push back against China and Russia trying to gain dominance over the Arctic region. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=266.4s)]
*  All of that considered, Denmark has control over Greenland. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=272.94s)]
*  It's a self-governing territory of Denmark. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=277.94s)]
*  And if Greenland was ever to get independence, it would have to vote in a referendum. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=280.06s)]
*  The Danish parliament would have to approve that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=283.62s)]
*  And so it's not just as easy as assessing that Greenland would be good for U.S. national [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=285.94s)]
*  security and taking some kind of action in that regard. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=290.6s)]
*  Greenland is key from a geopolitical perspective, but again, it is a self-governing territory [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  of Denmark. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=298.82000000000005s)]
*  Sam Vintergrad, thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=299.82000000000005s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYQM_X2Jk4Q&t=301.82s)]
