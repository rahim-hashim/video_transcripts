# Hegseth says "nobody was texting war plans" after Atlantic report
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck)
*  Hello and thank you for joining us. The editor-in-chief of The Atlantic says President Trump's top national security officials [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=0.0s)]
*  accidentally included him on a text chain discussing classified war plans. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=5.98s)]
*  The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg says he received an invite to join a group chat on the messaging app Signal [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=10.24s)]
*  where officials were debating plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. The chat included Vice President JD Vance, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=15.68s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Walz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and other cabinet-level officials according to the report. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=21.76s)]
*  A National Security Council spokesman says, quote, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  At the White House Monday, President Trump was asked for his reaction to the report, which seemed to take him by surprise. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=37.76s)]
*  I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  it's a magazine that's going out of business, and I don't know anything about it. You're telling me about it for the first time. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=47.28s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who just arrived in Hawaii Monday to kick off his first Indo-Pacific trip, had this to say about the report. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=52.88s)]
*  I've heard I've heard I was characterized. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=61.52s)]
*  Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that. Thank you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=64.0s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi joined us now. Olivia, what do we know about the sensitive information divulged in this group chat? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, what an extraordinary report there from Jeffrey Goldberg at The Atlantic about this group chat in Signal that he was a part of that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=77.76s)]
*  included not only him, but also the vice president, the secretary of defense, and the national security advisor talking in real time [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  about the potential strikes that they're going to take in Yemen against Houthi rebels. Not only were they discussing, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=94.0s)]
*  you know, at length the target [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  themselves, but also talking about the timeline, whether or not they should delay them for another month. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  We also saw in this group chat and some of the details of it that were published by Jeffrey Goldberg, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=108.32s)]
*  essentially a debate going on between the vice president and the secretary of defense about delaying [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=114.96s)]
*  these strikes for another month to allow for Europe to perhaps take a better or [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=120.8s)]
*  more advanced role in their own security in the region. Vice president JD Vance noted [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=126.88s)]
*  that Europe has about 40 percent of their [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=132.56s)]
*  trade go through the Suez Canal, whereas the U.S. only has three percent, and therefore it would be incumbent upon them [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  to take more of a step in negotiations and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  in these national security strikes against the Houthi rebels. Some of these texts were even published as a part of this article. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=146.08s)]
*  We also know that as a part of these discussions that Jeffrey Goldberg had witnessed in this article, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=152.8s)]
*  they also talked about targets, the weapons they were using, and the attack sequencing. Now, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=158.56s)]
*  these are things you obviously do not want to get out before you conduct any airstrikes against any, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=163.36s)]
*  you know, people who are not allies of the United States, but it's quite notable that he was in this group chat [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=170.08s)]
*  commercial application signal where they were having these sorts of discussions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=176.3s)]
*  I want to ask you about that in a second, but what's the latest we're hearing from the White House about this? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=181.04s)]
*  Well, we are just hearing from the White House now from Caroline Levitt, the press secretary of the White House, where she said [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=184.4s)]
*  that they still have full confidence in Trump's national security team, and that also includes national security advisor [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=190.96s)]
*  Mike Walz, who was the individual who actually asked Goldberg to join the chat, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=197.52s)]
*  perhaps unbeknownst to them that this was a journalist and not someone [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=202.16s)]
*  within the national security apparatus that they wanted in this group chat. Trump there, you heard a little bit earlier saying [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=206.16s)]
*  he was not aware of the Atlantic article, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=213.36s)]
*  and he went on to say after that that the leak couldn't have been very effective because the attack was effective. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=216.08s)]
*  Then he also admonished the Atlantic by saying they're going out of business and they're not much of a magazine. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=222.08s)]
*  All of this to say though that this is still, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  if unintentional, a very, very big breach of security. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  What are the bigger implications of this, especially with sensitive conversations taking place outside of normal channels, right, Olivia? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=235.12s)]
*  Well, there's certainly conversations to be had about the discussion of how classified information [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=241.76s)]
*  is handled in this government. That's been a conversation that's been ongoing not only [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=248.72s)]
*  under this administration, but the previous administration and during Trump's own administration, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  his first administration. So there's certainly conversation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=259.28s)]
*  about that and the handling of classified materials that has been ongoing. I suspect that more conversations will be raised specifically as a result of this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=262.24s)]
*  particular leak. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=270.96s)]
*  But really, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=272.72s)]
*  next steps as far as what could be done specifically about this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=274.16s)]
*  Look, Trump has said he still has full confidence in his national security team, including Waltz, but there's also Congress. Congressional Republicans could launch [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=278.4s)]
*  any sort of investigation into how this happened and how much information, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=287.2s)]
*  beyond just war plans, are being shared on a commercial messaging app like Signal. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=291.68s)]
*  By all means, it doesn't seem like that's something they're willing to do right now. We've heard from several congressional Republicans [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=297.44s)]
*  throughout the day who expressed surprise, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  but not exactly a mobilization effort to really [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=307.28s)]
*  do anything to reprimand the people who were involved in this specifically. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  So as of right now, it just seems like this is a story that's going to keep ricocheting around Washington. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=315.2s)]
*  We'll have to see if there's actually any impact that will happen to the national security apparatus, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=319.76s)]
*  but also to Trump's national security team as a result. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=324.48s)]
*  And we will have more congressional reaction from our Nicole Kelly leader in the show. Olivia Rinaldi, thank you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlWqkZ2tXck&t=327.44s)]
