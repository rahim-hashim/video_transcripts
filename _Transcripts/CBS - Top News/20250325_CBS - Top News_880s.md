# Trump takes questions on Yemen group chat, says information shared wasn't classified
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc)
*  We want to take you to the White House where President Trump and National Security Advisor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Walz are answering questions about the group chat snafu. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=4.24s)]
*  Let's listen in. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=8.66s)]
*  It's a question I've been asked now and I've given a few answers and they've all been the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=9.66s)]
*  same. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=15.06s)]
*  We have an amazing group. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=16.06s)]
*  Our national security now is stronger than it's ever been. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=17.5s)]
*  We have had a very, very successful numerous attacks on that area. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=21.06s)]
*  These are people that shoot down ships, not only our ships, ships all over the world. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=26.3s)]
*  They're shooting down right out of the water and damaging them badly or they're going down. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=30.3s)]
*  They're also shooting anything that happens to be flying in the area. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=35.3s)]
*  We hit them very, very hard. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=38.82s)]
*  There was no classified information as I understand it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  They used a app, if you want to call it an app, that a lot of people use, a lot of people [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=45.14s)]
*  in government use, a lot of people in the media use. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  And I think I'll ask Mike, Mike is here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=55.14s)]
*  Do you want to respond to that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=57.42s)]
*  Yes, Mr. President, you asked about lessons. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  I think there's a lot of the lessons. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=61.42s)]
*  There's a lot of journalists in this city who have made big names for themselves making [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=62.78s)]
*  up lies about this president, whether it's the Russia hoax or making up lies about Gold [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=67.86s)]
*  Star families. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  And this one in particular, I've never met, don't know, never communicated with. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  And we are and we are looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=79.14s)]
*  But I'll tell you what, the world owes President Trump a favor. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=84.34s)]
*  Under Biden, global shipping was shut down, pinprick attacks, months between them, our [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=88.46s)]
*  destroyers being fired upon dozens of times. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=93.42s)]
*  President Trump took decisive active action with his national security team, took out [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=97.66s)]
*  the head missileer, knocked out missiles, knocked out headquarters, knocked out communication [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=102.82s)]
*  sites. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=108.1s)]
*  And for once, as we hear, as you all hear from every one of our allies, thank God for [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=109.16s)]
*  American leadership again, thank God for American strength. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  You're welcome, boy. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=118.44s)]
*  And look, we had a national security team that was coordinating these efforts as Director [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=120.44s)]
*  Radcliffe testified today. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=128.4s)]
*  His first day on the job, he was introduced to this app on his government systems at [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=131.6s)]
*  the CIA and at the State Department and otherwise. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=136.92s)]
*  So look, this journalist, Mr. President, wants the world talking about more hoaxes and this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  kind of nonsense rather than the freedom that you're enabling. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=146.6s)]
*  And a key part of our sovereignty is open sea lanes and knocking the crap out of terrorists, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=150.48s)]
*  which is exactly what your team and Pete Hegsak, a good friend and fellow veteran, is leading [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  the charge on. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  And it's an honor. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=161.2s)]
*  Very, very successful. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=162.48s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=163.48s)]
*  We had a very, very successful evening and we've had numerous successful evenings and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=164.48s)]
*  days in that area. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=170.28s)]
*  The hoodies are absolutely on the run. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=171.51999999999998s)]
*  The worst of them had been killed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=174.6s)]
*  This should have been done a long time ago by Biden, but Biden was an incompetent president. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=177.92s)]
*  He couldn't do anything. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  He would. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  He didn't know where where he was going. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  He had no clue. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=185.76s)]
*  This guy had no clue. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=186.76s)]
*  This should have been done a long time ago as they shoot missiles at ships, randomly [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=188.32s)]
*  shoot missiles at ships, and they make their own missiles. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  This is not an incompetent group of people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  They make their own missiles. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=198.28s)]
*  They get the missiles also from Iran. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=199.95999999999998s)]
*  It's an offshoot of Iran, another offshoot. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  You have Hamas, you have Hezbollah, you have the hoodies. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=205.0s)]
*  You got a lot of stuff going on with Iran. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=208.12s)]
*  And we sent a letter to Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=211.0s)]
*  You're going to have to be speaking to us one way or the other pretty soon because we [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=212.6s)]
*  can't let this happen. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=216.84s)]
*  But that's an app that a lot of people use. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=218.08s)]
*  And somebody got on. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=221.4s)]
*  I mean, happened to know the guys in total sleaze bag. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=222.4s)]
*  The Atlantic. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=225.16s)]
*  The Atlantic is a failed magazine. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=226.16s)]
*  It does very, very poorly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=228.04s)]
*  Nobody gives a damn about it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=229.8s)]
*  This gives it a little bit of a shot. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=232.04s)]
*  And I will tell you this, that they've made up more stories and they're just a failing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=235.08s)]
*  magazine. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=241.12s)]
*  The public understands that he's a very good man. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=242.12s)]
*  That man is a very good man right there that you criticize so strongly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=244.24s)]
*  He's a very good man and he will continue to do a good job. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  In addition to him, we had very good people in that meeting and those people have done [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=255.44s)]
*  a very, very effective job. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=261.48s)]
*  And you're going to see it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=263.16s)]
*  And it goes on, by the way. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=264.16s)]
*  It's going to go on. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=265.24s)]
*  And I think the hoodies wish that it didn't happen, but that's what it's all about. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=267.08s)]
*  We have to create a safe country, a safe world, and that's what we're doing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=272.72s)]
*  Mr. President, do you plan to expand the use of senior officials using Signal moving forward? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  The use of Signal to communicate from senior officials, especially when it comes to this? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=283.76s)]
*  I don't know anything about Signal. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=287.4s)]
*  I wasn't involved in this, but I just heard about it. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=288.6s)]
*  And I hear it's used by a lot of groups. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=291.96s)]
*  It's used by the media a lot. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=294.88s)]
*  It's used by a lot of the military and I think successfully. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=297.0s)]
*  But sometimes somebody can get onto those things. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=301.44s)]
*  That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the situation room with no [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  phones on, which is always the best, frankly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=309.15999999999997s)]
*  But you know, the best is to be there. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=311.76s)]
*  In fact, oftentimes I've been in — in fact, just last week I was in the situation room [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=315.0s)]
*  with something very important and we had a couple of people hooked up by line and I said, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=319.84s)]
*  cancel the line. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  Sorry, fellas. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  What you do is we'll tell you all about the meeting because I know people do get on those [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=326.35999999999996s)]
*  lines whether it's Signal or anything else. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=330.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=332.76s)]
*  So are you going to change any procedures as a result of this? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=333.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, we look at everything and, you know, they've made a big deal out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  of this because we've had two perfect months. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=340.44s)]
*  We're bringing — we are bringing in business. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=342.68s)]
*  We have another one announced tomorrow, a big one, very big. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=345.54s)]
*  Like in the history of our country, nobody's ever seen anything like it. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=349.24s)]
*  And I think probably a lot of people are saying it's — they started by saying it was the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=352.36s)]
*  month that a president has ever had, and I think that's true. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=357.6s)]
*  And now they say it's the best second month and they had to find something. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  And this certainly will look at this, but the main thing was nothing happened. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=365.08000000000004s)]
*  The attack was totally successful. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  It was, I guess, from what I understand, took place during and it wasn't classified information. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=374.0s)]
*  So this was not classified. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=380.20000000000005s)]
*  Now if it's classified information, it's probably a little bit different. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=381.52000000000004s)]
*  But I always say you have to learn from every experience. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=385.28s)]
*  I think it was very unfair the way they attacked Michael. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=388.32s)]
*  He's a good person. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=392.44s)]
*  The person that was on just happens to be a sleazebag. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=394.96s)]
*  So maybe that's just coincidence. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=397.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=398.96s)]
*  But you are going to conduct an investigation. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=399.96s)]
*  What would be the problem if the Atlantic released all the text messages if they're [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=400.96s)]
*  not classified? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=404.52s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=405.52s)]
*  I'd have to ask the military about that because, you know, maybe you wouldn't want that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=406.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=409.96s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=411.96s)]
*  From what I heard, the man that we're talking about, who's not somebody that I don't think [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=412.96s)]
*  most people have ever heard of, he left, he found it very boring and he left early. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=419.68s)]
*  He got off the line very early. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=424.88s)]
*  So I can't speak to it other than that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=427.35999999999996s)]
*  So he's made up a lot of stories and, you know, I think he's basically bad for the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=430.52s)]
*  country. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=434.56s)]
*  But it's a failing venture, very failing venture. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=435.56s)]
*  They're very upset. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=438.59999999999997s)]
*  And a thing like this is publicity for them. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=441.24s)]
*  But I don't think we should allow people that are very good, like that man sitting right [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=443.0s)]
*  at the end of the table who's done a great job, we shouldn't allow them to be hurt by [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=447.64000000000004s)]
*  it. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=451.88s)]
*  Mr. President, I want to ask you a question. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=452.88s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=453.88s)]
*  Are you saying you're okay with the continued use of Signal by administration officials? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=454.88s)]
*  No, that's not what I said. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=459.64000000000004s)]
*  I said we'll look into it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  But everybody else seems to be using it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=462.92s)]
*  It seems to be the number one used device or app, whatever you want to call it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=465.04s)]
*  And we will certainly look. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=470.76000000000005s)]
*  If it was up to me, everybody would be sitting in a room together. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=472.76000000000005s)]
*  The room would have solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and a lead floor. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  But you know, life doesn't always let you do that. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=481.56s)]
*  In the meantime, the attack itself that we were talking about and discussing has been [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=484.04s)]
*  an unbelievable success. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=488.88s)]
*  But you will conduct an investigation, is what you're saying. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=491.36s)]
*  We'll look into it, Chair. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=494.92s)]
*  Mr. President, I think we'll look into it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=495.92s)]
*  I would look into it, Chair. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=496.92s)]
*  I want to look into it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=497.92s)]
*  Is that the FBI or the FBI? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=498.92s)]
*  Anything like that. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=499.92s)]
*  I would ask them. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=502.2s)]
*  It's not really an FBI thing. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=503.2s)]
*  It's really something having to do with security. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=504.48s)]
*  Security like will somebody be able to break in? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  Are people able to break into conversations? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=511.16s)]
*  And if that's true, we're going to have to find some other form of device. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=514.04s)]
*  And I think that's something that we may have to do. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=518.76s)]
*  Some people like Signal very much. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=521.16s)]
*  The people probably don't. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=523.8s)]
*  But we'll look into it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=525.68s)]
*  I think, Michael, I've asked you to immediately study that and find out if people are able [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=526.68s)]
*  to break into a system. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=532.56s)]
*  Now, in this case, it wasn't that this attack was going on and nobody found out anything. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=534.16s)]
*  And again, the person that was on, as I understand it, he left very early because he didn't find [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=539.7199999999999s)]
*  it very exciting. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=544.76s)]
*  But I think it's something you should look into. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=546.2199999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir, we are. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=548.68s)]
*  We have our technical experts looking at it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=549.68s)]
*  We have our legal teams looking at it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=552.32s)]
*  And of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=555.9200000000001s)]
*  No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  And as you've said, we've repeatedly said the attack was phenomenal and it's ongoing. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  But the media wants to talk about everything else except for the hostages you're getting [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=569.2s)]
*  out of the Middle East, Iran on its back foot, sea lanes getting reopened, peace in Europe. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=572.9000000000001s)]
*  As we just saw today with a Black Sea ceasefire we were just on with Steve Witkoff, myself, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=579.68s)]
*  our team in Saudi Arabia. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=586.0799999999999s)]
*  They want to talk about all this other stuff except for your amazing successes and the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=587.0799999999999s)]
*  successes of your team. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  One of the other things, and sometimes you have to move very quickly and there are other [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=592.8399999999999s)]
*  devices that are very good, but they are very, very cumbersome and you're not able to use [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=597.16s)]
*  them from a practical standpoint. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=601.7199999999999s)]
*  So all we can do is find out the best we have with modern technology. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=605.56s)]
*  They'll probably get better over the years. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=610.0s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=611.9599999999999s)]
*  Sir, on the Black Sea, so the Kremlin has said that there were several conditions that would [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  need to be met for this agreement to happen. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=616.68s)]
*  This includes sanction relief for banks and some companies. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  Did the U.S. agree to all of those conditions that they laid out? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=621.4s)]
*  They will be looking at them and we're thinking about all of them right now. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=623.8399999999999s)]
*  There are about five or six conditions. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  We're looking at all of them. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=629.8s)]
*  The President has said that it's looking into how journalists got added to that SignalChat. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=631.64s)]
*  Is it possible that there could be a firing of even a lower mid-level official once that [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=638.28s)]
*  person is identified about the SignalChat that we've been discussing? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=643.6s)]
*  We pretty much looked into it. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=647.36s)]
*  It's pretty simple, to be honest. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=648.84s)]
*  It's not, it's just something that can happen. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=650.72s)]
*  It can happen. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=654.28s)]
*  You can even prepare for it. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=657.0s)]
*  It can happen. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=658.44s)]
*  Sometimes people are hooked in and you don't know they're hooked in. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=660.1999999999999s)]
*  They're hooked into your line and they don't even mean bad by it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=662.52s)]
*  But it's not a perfect technology. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=666.0s)]
*  There is no perfect technology. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  The really good ones are very cumbersome, very hard to access. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=669.9599999999999s)]
*  And I think we're going to look at, we always want to use the best technology. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=676.16s)]
*  This was the best technology for the moment. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=680.74s)]
*  But again, it wasn't classified, so they probably viewed it as being something that wasn't that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=683.28s)]
*  important. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=688.36s)]
*  Obviously, with the attack being, I mean, I don't know if it's been read out to you [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=689.36s)]
*  yet, but that attack was a tremendous success for the U.S., a tremendous success. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=694.44s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=698.96s)]
*  Do you think that Mike Waltz made a mistake and doesn't need to apologize? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=701.96s)]
*  No, I don't think he should apologize. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=706.96s)]
*  I think he's doing his best. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=709.96s)]
*  It's equipment and technology that's not perfect. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  And probably he won't be using it again, at least not in the very near future. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=716.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=720.88s)]
*  That's true. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=721.88s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=722.88s)]
*  Let's get everybody in the room whenever possible. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=723.88s)]
*  A lot of times you find out defects by exactly things like that. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=727.32s)]
*  But I don't think it's something we're looking forward to using again. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=731.52s)]
*  We may be forced to use it. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=735.76s)]
*  You may be in a situation where you need speed as opposed to gross safety. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=737.08s)]
*  And you may be forced to use it. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=743.76s)]
*  But generally speaking, I think we probably won't be using it very much. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=745.2s)]
*  The deputy defense on that train, the deputy defense, PXF and JD Vons, the vice president, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=748.2s)]
*  said that the Europeans were freeloading. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=755.2s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=757.2s)]
*  Do you really want me to answer? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=761.2s)]
*  We have been watching President Trump speak with reporters after signing new executive orders. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=763.0s)]
*  Questions coming just hours after some of his top intelligence officials were questioned [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=768.2s)]
*  by the Senate Intelligence Committee on how a journalist was inadvertently included in a group chat allegedly discussing plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=772.68s)]
*  Now, notably, the president and his national security adviser, Mike Walz, are not really addressing the controversy itself. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=780.68s)]
*  They're not talking about how it happened, just the fact that the strikes on the Houthi rebels in Yemen worked, saying that's all that matters. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=786.68s)]
*  The president slammed his predecessor, President Biden, as well as the Atlantic, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=793.68s)]
*  which the editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently included in that group text. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=798.68s)]
*  The president calling him a sleazebag, saying the Atlantic is a failed magazine and they've made up more stories. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=802.68s)]
*  Notably, we should mention the National Security Council said Monday in a statement to CBS News the message thread appears to be authentic. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=807.68s)]
*  Now, the president said he doesn't know anything about Signal, this encrypted app where the communications were taking place. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=814.68s)]
*  He says he just heard about this. He says he understands it's used by a lot of groups, including the military. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=821.68s)]
*  I said it's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the situation room. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=826.68s)]
*  He also said that he believes the media is making a big deal out of this because his administration has had a very successful first two months in office in the second term. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=830.68s)]
*  The president said that no classified information was shared in the chat. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=839.68s)]
*  He said if it's classified, it's probably a little bit different. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=843.68s)]
*  And he added you have to learn from every experience. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=846.68s)]
*  Now, national security adviser Walz said that their technical and legal teams are looking into all of this. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=848.68s)]
*  A reporter asked the president if Waltz should up. Did he make a mistake? Should he apologize? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=855.68s)]
*  The president said, no, he shouldn't apologize. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=859.68s)]
*  The equipment isn't perfect and they won't be using it again, especially in the near future. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koLl1uKcVzc&t=862.68s)]
