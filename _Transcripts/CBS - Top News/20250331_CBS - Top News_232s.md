# Stock markets anxious over Trump tariffs uncertainty
**CBS - Top News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw)
*  And with just about the tea, two hours to go until markets open, stock futures are down this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=0.0s)]
*  Wall Street saw substantial losses on Friday, and that drop was driven by worse than expected inflation data [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=5.8s)]
*  and existing anxiety over these pending tariffs. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=12.6s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in senior White House correspondent, Weijia Zhang. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=16.4s)]
*  Hey, Weijia, good morning to you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=19.8s)]
*  How are Americans reacting to the president's tariffs plan and the impending economic shifts? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=21.8s)]
*  Because it does seem to be making many uneasy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=27.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that it is the uncertainty that economists really point to when they say that consumer confidence [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=31.4s)]
*  is really taking a tumble arrow, and that's across the board, no matter the person's age or political affiliation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=37.8s)]
*  or even their income bracket, because they don't really know yet exactly how much prices could spike. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=43.8s)]
*  Of course, President Trump insists that the prices won't be affected. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=50.0s)]
*  He says this is going to create boomtown for the U.S. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=54.2s)]
*  because his theory is that if you put tariffs on imports, then people will start buying more American-made products, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=57.0s)]
*  more manufacturing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=64.0s)]
*  But in our new CBS News poll, Errol, it's really interesting because more than half of Americans say they disapprove [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=65.4s)]
*  of Trump's handling of the economy. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=74.0s)]
*  64 percent say the administration is not focusing enough on lowering prices, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=76.4s)]
*  and 55 percent believe there's too much emphasis on tariffs. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=81.2s)]
*  Of course, it's going to take time to see how these tariffs really play out and if they can lead to that economic upturn. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=86.0s)]
*  But in the meantime, Errol, you're right, there is a lot of uncertainty and confusion, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=92.8s)]
*  especially for the auto industry, because it's not only foreign vehicles that are going to have this 25 percent tariff, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=96.8s)]
*  but foreign parts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=103.0s)]
*  So even American cars, a lot of American cars are made up of imported parts. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=104.2s)]
*  So we expect that the price of cars will increase by at least 10 percent. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=110.0s)]
*  That's according to several economic analysts. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=115.2s)]
*  Yeah, Ouija, that's a great point. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=118.2s)]
*  And the president also suggested that another country that the U.S. could place tariffs on is Russia. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=120.0s)]
*  What did Mr. Trump have to say about Russian President Vladimir Putin? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=127.4s)]
*  Because we haven't heard him being as critical of him as late. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=131.0s)]
*  Well, in fact, Errol, he's been almost extending various olive branches to Putin, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=136.0s)]
*  really trying to thaw the relationship between the U.S. and Russia. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  But this certainly flies in the face of that because he said he was very angry and, quote, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=144.8s)]
*  pissed off at Putin after Putin called for the ousting of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=150.8s)]
*  And Trump says, look, he still wants to broker a deal for peace between those two countries. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=157.8s)]
*  But he said if it doesn't happen and if it's Russia's fault, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=163.0s)]
*  he will impose what's called secondary sanctions on Russian oil. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=166.6s)]
*  So that's not only on Russia, but it's on any country that buys oil from Russia. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=170.8s)]
*  The president says if it comes to that, basically, if you buy oil from Moscow, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=176.6s)]
*  you won't be able to do business with the U.S. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=181.6s)]
*  And the reason we've got so many new headlines this morning is the president took a number of questions on Sunday. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=185.2s)]
*  And I know that he also spoke about the aftermath of that Signal group chat we've talked so much about. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=190.2s)]
*  What is he saying about that? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=195.6s)]
*  Well, you know, despite various reports, Errol, that he was considering firing the national security adviser, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=198.2s)]
*  Michael Walz, Trump is doubling down. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=204.6s)]
*  He says nobody is going anywhere, basically, that if you were involved in the Signal chat, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=207.6s)]
*  he says this is just a witch hunt. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=212.2s)]
*  It's a hoax and that nobody did anything wrong. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=214.6s)]
*  And so he is not going to take any punitive action on anybody. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=218.4s)]
*  In other words, nobody is going to be held accountable, Errol. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=222.8s)]
*  All right, Weijia Zhang, with all the latest from the White House for us this morning. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=226.6s)]
*  Weijia, thank you. Great to see you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=229.6s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OQn_srYOKw&t=231.0s)]
