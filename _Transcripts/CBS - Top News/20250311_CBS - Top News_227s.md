# Why a judge blocked a pro-Palestinian activist's deportation
**CBS - Top News:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g)
*  Well, there is new fallout after a legal U.S. resident was detained and threatened with deportation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=0.0s)]
*  after organizing pro-Palestinian rallies at Columbia University. Now, this case has been [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=6.16s)]
*  prompting protests in New York City and beyond. Now, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=11.52s)]
*  deportation of Columbia University graduate Babu Khalil. Now, according to Khalil's lawyer, ICE [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=17.36s)]
*  agents initially said they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=23.76s)]
*  but the Syrian native is actually a U.S. green card holder, and as of right now, he is still [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  detained in Louisiana. So, legal analyst and trial attorney Robin Nunn joins us now to lean into this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  a little bit more. Robin, why was Khalil taken to Louisiana? Yeah, it's unclear right now. Formal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=42.08s)]
*  charges have not yet been filed, but many believe that the transfer of Mahmoud Khalil to Louisiana [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=49.12s)]
*  likely relates to federal immigration detention procedure. Louisiana is home to several ICE [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  detention facilities, and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=67.2s)]
*  And you mentioned he still hasn't been charged with the crime yet. So, what legal authority is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=72.88s)]
*  the federal government using to claim that he should be deported? See, that is the real linchpin [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=77.92s)]
*  issue here. What is the legal basis here for deportation? The federal government typically [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=83.68s)]
*  relies on the Immigration and Nationality Act, and if Khalil is subject to removal, the government [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=89.84s)]
*  would need to establish grounds under that act for those who are already in the United States [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  who have some green card or some form of citizenship. And so, the Department of Homeland [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement may argue here that Khalil is [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=106.8s)]
*  deportable for reasons including national security, visa violations, alleged criminal conduct. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  It's really too soon to say because nothing has really been filed yet, but I think the key [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=119.36s)]
*  question here is going to be whether he is being detained under some sort of allowable basis for [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=124.4s)]
*  some sort of crime or terrorism-related activities or if he poses some sort of security threat here [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=131.28s)]
*  in the United States, which would then make him deportable. Yeah, because when President Trump [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=137.52s)]
*  posted online about this arrest yesterday, he vowed to apprehend terrorist sympathizers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=142.16s)]
*  He's not the only one. So, at what point would an act of protest be considered an act of terrorism? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=148.08s)]
*  And I think that's why this is such an important issue and why so many folks are paying attention [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  to this is when does protest become terrorism? Under U.S. law, we are all very familiar with the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=160.0s)]
*  First Amendment right of free speech and obviously there's been a lot of people engaging in open and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=166.8s)]
*  public protests towards certain things that are going on right now in Israel and Palestine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=174.16s)]
*  And the government, on the other hand, obviously has a real concern about terrorism. And the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=180.0s)]
*  government defines domestic terrorism quite broadly. It can be involved in any violent or dangerous [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=186.4s)]
*  conduct, any intimidation or coercion of civilians against government policy within the U.S. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=193.2s)]
*  jurisdiction. So, I think this is going to be a really interesting case of whether a protest [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  remains protected under the First Amendment, if participants can be alleged to have engaged in any [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  sort of violence or destruction of property or threats of harm. I think this is going to be [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=212.16s)]
*  where Trump's statement about how broadly terrorist sympathizers will be defined is really [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=217.68s)]
*  going to come into question. Robin Nunn, thank you so much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47VikepNC5g&t=222.48s)]
