# GOP Rep. Mike Lawler says Signal chat leak should never have happened
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=0.0s)]
*  More than a handful of Republicans on Capitol Hill today described the leak of the Signal [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=1.94s)]
*  Group chat regarding the Houthis and attack plans as a quote, mistake. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=6.58s)]
*  But some went a little bit further and they tried to downplay whether the sensitive details [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=11.94s)]
*  were really that sensitive in the first place. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=17.34s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=19.3s)]
*  There was no locations listed there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=20.46s)]
*  There were no sources of methods. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=22.16s)]
*  There's no specific targets. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=23.98s)]
*  Certainly there was nothing called war plans, which was an embellishment and exaggeration [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=25.3s)]
*  by a known left-wing partisan opponent of the president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=30.46s)]
*  New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler joins me now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=35.74s)]
*  Congressman, good to see you. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=38.7s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=39.86s)]
*  Look, let's stipulate up front that this set of attacks was different than the Biden administration, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=40.86s)]
*  that it was carried out well, and it probably did important damage relevant to an important [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=48.34s)]
*  international commercial matter, which is traveling through the Red Sea without being [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=53.42s)]
*  harassed by the Houthis. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=61.38s)]
*  I don't want to lose sight of that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=62.38s)]
*  Stipulate that up front. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=65.78s)]
*  Are you comfortable that details of that successful mission were conducted on Signal one and two [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=67.7s)]
*  that any reporter, Jeff Goldberg or any other, was inadvertently included? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=77.94s)]
*  So a few things here, Major. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=84.46s)]
*  Number one, I do agree to the stipulation. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=86.46s)]
*  This was a successful mission, an important mission. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=88.98s)]
*  The Houthis had been allowed to act with impunity over the last year and a half under the watchful [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=92.82s)]
*  eye of the Biden administration. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=101.86s)]
*  The fact is that this was necessary, and I do think the mission was executed well. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=104.18s)]
*  That being said, as I said the day this story broke, you know, this type of information, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=111.78s)]
*  this type of discussion should occur in secure locations and using secure platforms. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=119.06s)]
*  I would note in December of last year, the Biden administration and CISA put out guidance [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=128.58s)]
*  with respect to end-to-end encryption and using apps like Signal for communication and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=133.94s)]
*  encouraging folks to do so. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=142.38s)]
*  But obviously when you're talking about sensitive, you know, information such as this, it is [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=144.96s)]
*  imperative that we take all precaution. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=151.74s)]
*  And certainly in this instance, you had a situation where a reporter was added to this [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=155.86s)]
*  group chat. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=163.38000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure we will get, you know, down to how and who specifically. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=164.38000000000002s)]
*  But at the end of the day, any time you are using an application like this, there is great [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=170.64000000000001s)]
*  potential. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=178.58s)]
*  Not just that somebody be mistakenly added, but we all know, you know, people screen grab [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=179.86s)]
*  conversations, you know, I mean, there's so many potentials here of what could go wrong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=185.58s)]
*  Mike, let me jump in if I could, because this administration wastes no time in mocking Biden [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  era rules. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=196.86s)]
*  So I want to talk to you about what the NSA under the Trump administration said last month. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=197.86s)]
*  Don't go on Signal if you're discussing anything sensitive. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=202.82000000000002s)]
*  Times of your kids soccer match, fine, but anything sensitive, don't be on Signal under [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  any circumstances. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=211.34s)]
*  What's the Trump era advisory? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=212.9s)]
*  Look, I think many people acknowledge this was a mistake. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=215.34s)]
*  It is something that should not have happened. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=220.38s)]
*  And I, you know, obviously believe there needs to be guardrails put in place to ensure it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=223.14000000000001s)]
*  never happens again. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=227.9s)]
*  You know, I do think folks need to acknowledge that and make sure this does not happen. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=230.38s)]
*  are looking for every, you know, means and method to make sure that, you know, they are [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=238.62s)]
*  able to thwart our efforts. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  And in this instance, obviously a very successful mission. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=249.74s)]
*  But you know, obviously, when we're talking about national security, we all have to take [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  due caution in how we engage in it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=259.1s)]
*  Mike, do you believe Jeff Goldberg acted in any way irresponsibly in the handling of this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=262.9s)]
*  matter? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=267.26s)]
*  Look, I think obviously folks can have their opinion on how this was characterized, the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=269.34s)]
*  information that was revealed in the text exchange. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=275.7s)]
*  Obviously, we saw more information this morning. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=280.82s)]
*  You know, I think obviously he did not release it in real time, which I think, frankly, to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=285.3s)]
*  his credit, you know, I think that's important. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=291.42s)]
*  It could have jeopardized the mission. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=294.02s)]
*  But ultimately, obviously, this is a situation where a mistake was made and should not have [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=296.90000000000003s)]
*  happened. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=303.90000000000003s)]
*  And so, you know, that is the issue at hand that needs to be corrected. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=305.22s)]
*  I also want to talk to you about something that's going on with the Social Security [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=313.78000000000003s)]
*  Administration and not just your district, but congressional districts around the country [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=317.14000000000004s)]
*  are slated to lose regional offices. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=321.5s)]
*  What are you going to do about that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=323.5s)]
*  Are you happy with that? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  So to be clear, field offices are not being shut down. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  It is specific to hearing offices and specifically the one that is within proximity to my district, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=334.18s)]
*  the White Plains Hearing Office, is about 66,000 square feet. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=341.86s)]
*  About 80 percent of these cases are now being heard virtually. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=346.98s)]
*  There were issues with that office with respect to mold. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=352.42s)]
*  The Biden administration is the one that put that office on the path to closure. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=355.7s)]
*  They informed us of that at the end of last year, that this office was going to be closed. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=360.94s)]
*  I have been working with the administration to find a solution. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  We obviously want to make sure that people have access when they need a hearing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=371.78s)]
*  The field office itself within my district in Rockland County is under renovation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=377.62s)]
*  It's been for a year. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=382.18s)]
*  It is slated to reopen in May. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=384.02s)]
*  I am working to try to get resolution on the hearing office so that potentially, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=386.02s)]
*  the Social Security Administration would allow the Rockland field office to be used as a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=390.82s)]
*  hearing office as well, which is only about 15 minutes from White Plains. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=394.86s)]
*  Obviously, we want to make sure people have access to their benefits, have access to the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=400.14s)]
*  Social Security Administration, and that they get the services they are entitled to here. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=404.82s)]
*  I have been pushing back against the closure, but I want to work towards a positive solution [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=410.46s)]
*  here to address the concerns, but also make sure that my constituents and constituents [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=417.94s)]
*  across this country are served by the Social Security Administration. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=429.94s)]
*  Mike, thanks. I appreciate your time. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=431.78s)]
*  Thanks, Major. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5Jk827W1Ik&t=434.26s)]
