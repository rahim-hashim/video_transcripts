# What we know about Trump executive order to dismantle Education Department
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc)
*  But we start this morning with President Trump, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=0.0s)]
*  who's expected to sign an executive order this afternoon, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=2.64s)]
*  designed to be first steps in dismantling [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=5.48s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=8.44s)]
*  He has signaled this move for weeks, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=9.6s)]
*  but it would still need congressional approval [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=11.0s)]
*  to fully shutter this government agency. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=13.0s)]
*  So I wanna bring in CBS News White House reporter, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=16.02s)]
*  Willie James Inman. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=18.34s)]
*  He's joining me now from the White House [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=19.18s)]
*  to talk about this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=21.14s)]
*  Willie James, the White House, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=22.7s)]
*  questions over the President's authority to do this. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=25.52s)]
*  What are we learning? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=27.28s)]
*  Hey there, Vlad, good to be with you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=29.24s)]
*  Well, the White House says that this is about returning [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  the power for education to the states. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=34.12s)]
*  Now, it's unclear how the different types of funding [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  that the Department of Education takes in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=39.8s)]
*  will roll out to the states once it's dismantled. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=42.16s)]
*  But as you pointed out perfectly, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=44.44s)]
*  the President would need Congress's support [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=46.44s)]
*  to be able to essentially end the Department of Education. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=48.76s)]
*  This is something that the White House has telegraphed [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=53.14s)]
*  for weeks, as you mentioned as well. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  But this is the beginning stages, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=57.76s)]
*  this executive authority to dismantle [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=59.72s)]
*  the Department of Education. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=62.08s)]
*  Unclear if it will include job cuts as well. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  Remember that is something that has already happened [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=66.12s)]
*  with half of the workforce [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=67.98s)]
*  at the Department of Education essentially fired. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=70.08s)]
*  But the President making this announcement [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=72.96s)]
*  and signing this executive order today at 4 p.m. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=74.82s)]
*  Right, so again, we've been saying this, Willie James, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=78.08s)]
*  only Congress has the power to fully shutter the agency. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  So is this performative? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=85.36s)]
*  I mean, people are certainly going to be laid off. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  We know that, that's gonna be another case [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=89.88s)]
*  where government workers find themselves out of a job. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=92.32s)]
*  That's not good for the economy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=94.6s)]
*  But when we talk about fully closing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=96.16s)]
*  the Department of Education, what does that look like? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=98.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, part of it would require essentially [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  moving different things such as student loans [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=105.11999999999999s)]
*  that are handled by the Department of Education, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=107.08s)]
*  perhaps to the Treasury Department [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  or the Commerce Department. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=110.83999999999999s)]
*  That's not happening today though. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=112.02s)]
*  A White House official pointed out that student loans, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=114.11999999999999s)]
*  assistance to school districts for low income families [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=117.28s)]
*  and individuals with disabilities, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=120.52s)]
*  those assistance programs will still continue [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=122.96s)]
*  to be handled by the Department of Education. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=126.28s)]
*  The President isn't eliminating that today. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=128.68s)]
*  As I mentioned, he will need Congress's buy-in. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=131.04s)]
*  It's unclear if that'll actually happen with this Congress. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=134.12s)]
*  This is something that Republicans have eyed [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=137.54s)]
*  that they want to happen, but this is the beginning stages [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=139.84s)]
*  giving that power to the Education Secretary [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=143.24s)]
*  to begin dismantling the Department of Education [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=146.4s)]
*  as long as she can lawfully do so, different parts of it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=149.48000000000002s)]
*  But those key programs that a lot of families, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=152.98000000000002s)]
*  millions of families depend on, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=155.0s)]
*  those programs will still be in place, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  at least for now, at the Department of Education, Vlad. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  All right, Willie James Zimmman for us at the White House. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, my friend, appreciate it. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-2vPHNdMOc&t=163.08s)]
