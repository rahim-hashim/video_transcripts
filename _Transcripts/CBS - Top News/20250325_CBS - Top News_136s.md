# U.S. announces Black Sea deal between Ukraine and Russia
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U)
*  A major announcement from the White House on talks in Saudi Arabia aimed at getting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=0.0s)]
*  a ceasefire in the war between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=4.5s)]
*  Both the Kremlin and the U.S. released separate statements on those agreements. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi for more on this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=12.16s)]
*  Olivia, can you first give us the details of what this potential agreement could mean? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=15.32s)]
*  Yeah, Liz, this is the result of three days of intense negotiations in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=19.8s)]
*  between the U.S., Ukrainians, and the Russians. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=26.26s)]
*  Well, what's important to note here is that the Ukrainians and the Russians never actually [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=29.3s)]
*  spoke to each other face to face. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=32.68s)]
*  All these negotiations happen as a result of meetings with U.S. mediators. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=34.86s)]
*  So essentially, the Ukrainians would tell the U.S. what they wanted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=39.02s)]
*  They would take it to the Russians and mediate this entire conversation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=42.72s)]
*  The result of it is an expanded partial ceasefire between the Ukrainians and the Russians pertaining [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=46.28s)]
*  to the Black Sea particularly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=52.58s)]
*  What they agreed upon is ensuring safe navigation and preventing the use of commercial vessels [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=54.86s)]
*  for military use in the Black Sea. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=61.32s)]
*  Now, that's a very crucial corridor where a lot of these battles have been playing out [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=63.28s)]
*  over the course of this nearly three-year long war. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=67.28s)]
*  In addition to the partial ceasefire being expanded there, we also learned of a few other [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=70.6s)]
*  details pertaining to this partial ceasefire or at least getting to this partial ceasefire. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  That also includes the U.S. helping to restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=82.88s)]
*  and fertilizer exports. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=88.97999999999999s)]
*  Now, this is extremely important because if you'll remember, back when the war in Ukraine [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=90.38s)]
*  started there were sanctions placed on these Russian fertilizers that are among some of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=94.58s)]
*  their top exports. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=100.14s)]
*  And what that did was really spike the price of food worldwide. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=101.62s)]
*  So as a result, the U.S. is open to having Russian fertilizers being back on the global [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=104.5s)]
*  trade market. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=110.22s)]
*  The U.S. also said today in this statement that they remain committed to getting home [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=111.61999999999999s)]
*  Ukrainian prisoners of war as a part of this expanded partial ceasefire. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  So this is really a significant first step to ending this war, something the Trump administration [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=120.38s)]
*  has been pushing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=126.22s)]
*  It falls short of an all-out ceasefire, but again, some of those first steps that we're [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=127.41999999999999s)]
*  starting to see as a result of these continuing negotiations in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvoQ-ux7E4U&t=131.95999999999998s)]
