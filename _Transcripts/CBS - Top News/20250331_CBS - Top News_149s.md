# Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre hospitalized after "serious accident"
**CBS - Top News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE)
*  Virginia Roberts Jufre, a woman who accused Jeffrey Epstein and Prince Andrew of sex crimes, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=0.0s)]
*  now says she is fighting for her life after a bus crash. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=6.16s)]
*  Let's go to our breaking news correspondent, Chanel Call, in the CBS Newsroom in New York [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=10.56s)]
*  for more. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=14.68s)]
*  Chanel, tell us more. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=15.68s)]
*  What happened? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=16.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=17.68s)]
*  So in an Instagram post that we saw on Sunday, Virginia Jufre appeared to look bruised. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=18.68s)]
*  She says she's in kidney failure, adding that doctors gave her just four days to live. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=23.48s)]
*  Today, Jules, her representative, says she suffered a serious accident and also confirms [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=28.92s)]
*  Jufre is still receiving medical care in the hospital. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=35.08s)]
*  Now as for what happened, Jufre alluded to this. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=39.32s)]
*  In this post, she says there was a crash with a school bus, is what she's alluding to here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=42.88s)]
*  She says, important to note that when a school bus driver comes at you driving 110 kilometers [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=47.88s)]
*  as we were sowing for a turn, that no matter what your car is made of, it might as well [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=53.72s)]
*  be a tin can. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=58.28s)]
*  So at this point, Jules is still unclear where the accident happened. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=59.28s)]
*  But I can tell you that in 2022, the BBC reported that Jufre lived in Australia with her husband [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=63.56s)]
*  and three children. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=69.8s)]
*  I want to show you that Instagram post again because it goes on to say, I'm ready to go [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  just not until I see my babies one last time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=76.2s)]
*  But you know what they say about wishes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=79.68s)]
*  Just to give you some context and background here, Jufre, she is one of the most prominent [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=82.0s)]
*  accusers of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=87.32s)]
*  Many people will remember her story. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=90.8s)]
*  She alleged Epstein sexually trafficked her to Britain's Prince Andrew and others while [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=92.96s)]
*  she was a minor. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=98.19999999999999s)]
*  Prince Andrew denied those claims. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=99.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  And Chanel Jufre actually sat down for an interview with CBS News back in 2020. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  So tell us more about her story when she shared that with us. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=110.75999999999999s)]
*  In that interview with our Gail King, Jufre spoke about how she says she first met Jeffrey [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=116.48s)]
*  She claimed in that interview that Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell was the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  mastermind behind the alleged sex trafficking. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=123.04s)]
*  She also said, quote, she is a monster. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=126.04s)]
*  She is worse than Epstein. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=128.72s)]
*  She did things even worse than Epstein did. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=130.24s)]
*  She was vicious. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=132.86s)]
*  She was evil. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  And she's a woman. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=135.12s)]
*  Speaking about Maxwell. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=136.12s)]
*  During that interview with Gail, Jules Jufre also claimed that Maxwell had video of other [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=138.12s)]
*  well-known people that she could incriminate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  All right, Chanel, Chanel Call, thank you so much. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCRrwY6nbE&t=145.76s)]
