# FBI creates task force to investigate Tesla threats
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4)
*  The FBI says it has created a task force to investigate threats and attacks against Tesla locations and vehicles [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=0.0s)]
*  It comes after incendiary devices were found at a Tesla dealership in Austin, Texas Monday afternoon [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=6.48s)]
*  Austin police referred the case to the city's bomb squad which removed the materials without incident [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=12.4s)]
*  Monday's threat is only the latest in a series of attacks on Tesla as some Americans protest Elon Musk's role in the federal government [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=17.56s)]
*  CBS News national reporter Karen Hwa joins us now Karen. What's the latest there? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Hey Lindsay, yeah, so Austin police have confirmed to us [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=30.2s)]
*  They showed up to this dealership in northwest Austin earlier this morning around 8 o'clock where they found two of those suspicious devices [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=34.16s)]
*  They haven't yet said what those devices are just said the bomb squad investigated them and found them to be [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=41.8s)]
*  Incendiary or otherwise meant to catch fire. The good news is no one was hurt [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=48.32s)]
*  but of course officials now have to go through the work of trying to figure out who did this and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=52.92s)]
*  Why as you mentioned Lindsay this is part of this nationwide trend that we've seen since January [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=57.28s)]
*  The FBI just put together a task force to look into these Tesla incidents [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=62.56s)]
*  They just put out this public safety alert as well [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=66.44s)]
*  So a lot of these have been happening [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=69.8s)]
*  President Trump calling all of these people who've been causing harm to these Tesla's quote [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=71.92s)]
*  extreme domestic terrorists according to our CBS News reporting we have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=78.12s)]
*  Reported at least 32 incidents across 16 states involving Tesla's as of this year in at least 13 of those cases [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=83.4s)]
*  They involve some sort of swastikas or Nazi imagery and at least eight of these cases dealership cyberchats and other [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=91.28s)]
*  Vehicles were set on fire [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=98.9s)]
*  So those are arson investigations and at least four of them they involve some sort of political messaging and three of them [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  They're work on shots. You can see there's a various range of these Elon Musk saying they're trying to up security [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=106.88s)]
*  As much as they can Lindsay Karen. Well, thank you so much [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3SvLWMcM4&t=112.16s)]
