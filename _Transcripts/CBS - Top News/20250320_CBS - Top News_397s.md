# White House slams judge on El Salvador mass deportation flights case
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M)
*  Well, at this hour, a legal showdown is unfolding between the Department of Justice and a Washington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=0.0s)]
*  D.C. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=5.92s)]
*  judge. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=6.92s)]
*  Judge James Boesberg has demanded the department reveal details about two deportation flights [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=7.92s)]
*  involving alleged Venezuelan immigrants. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=13.08s)]
*  Now, last week, more than 200 migrants in the U.S. were flown to El Salvador after that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=16.2s)]
*  country's president agreed to accept them. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=22.12s)]
*  They're now being held in prison there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=25.04s)]
*  And Attorney General Pam Bondi says the government may invoke state secrets privilege to block [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=27.32s)]
*  Judge Boesberg's order. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=32.44s)]
*  White House Press Secretary Caroline Levitt had this to say earlier today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=34.56s)]
*  The judge in this case is essentially trying to say that the president doesn't have the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=41.72s)]
*  executive authority to deport foreign terrorists from our American soil. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=46.32s)]
*  That is an egregious abuse of the bench. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  This judge does not have that authority. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=55.58s)]
*  It is the opinion of this White House and of this administration. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=57.78s)]
*  That's why we're fighting this in court. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=60.98s)]
*  And it's very, very clear that this is an activist judge who is trying to usurp the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=63.339999999999996s)]
*  president's authority. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=68.18s)]
*  CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen joins us now from Washington. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=69.18s)]
*  Jake, that noon Eastern time deadline has gone and passed. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=73.94s)]
*  Any word on the administration's response, if any? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=78.02s)]
*  We have not seen any new information hit the docket yet, although it's likely that this [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  was potentially just sent to Judge Boesberg if it was sent at all. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=86.3s)]
*  I'm sure there will be more to come in the next couple of minutes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  But just to scene set really what we've seen, this kind of ping pong battle over the last [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=92.5s)]
*  couple of days between people like Caroline Levitt, Elon Musk and President Trump accusing [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=96.38s)]
*  Judge Boesberg of being a quote activist judge. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=101.06s)]
*  Elon Musk and allies have called to impeach him, including President Trump, which means [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=103.66s)]
*  a Senate hearing and Senate votes to remove him from his position. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=107.38s)]
*  This is all because on Saturday, Judge Boesberg blocked the deportation of these alleged trend [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=111.84s)]
*  to Aragwatch gang members to El Salvador. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=116.64s)]
*  The Salvadoran government accepted them and all the footage that you're seeing now was [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=119.92s)]
*  basically staged media, which caught these flights as they landed. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=123.44s)]
*  The judge just simply wants to know in this whole standoff more details and operational [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  details on the flight. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=131.9s)]
*  The Department of Justice is saying the judge really has no right to ask for any of that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=133.2s)]
*  In addition to that, basically being moot because there will be an appeals hearing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=136.84s)]
*  on Monday in front of a three panel judge here in Washington, D.C., which will hear [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  again a higher court argument to hear arguments on both sides as to why this block for now [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=145.0s)]
*  should be struck down. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=149.36s)]
*  And Jake, I want to ask you about a developing story out of Georgetown University, a researcher [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=150.36s)]
*  detained by immigration authorities on March 17th. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=156.08s)]
*  Now CBS News learned his name is Bidar Khan Suri. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=159.24s)]
*  He is an Indian national postdoctoral candidate teaching at the university on a student visa. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  Now, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Suri's visa was canceled for what they call [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=170.48s)]
*  foreign policy reasons. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=175.32s)]
*  The agency posted on X saying, quote, Suri was a foreign exchange student at Georgetown [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=177.56s)]
*  University, actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting anti-Semitism on social media. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=182.23999999999998s)]
*  Now Georgetown released a statement on the detention saying in part, quote, we are not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=189.88s)]
*  aware of him engaging in any illegal activity and we have not received a reason for his [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=194.12s)]
*  detention. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=199.72s)]
*  We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=200.8s)]
*  Now, CBS News has some reporting on this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  Jake, what have you learned? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  That's right. This morning, I went to a federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, just down [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=210.36s)]
*  the road from here, where we obtained the initial complaint by Mr. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=214.16s)]
*  Khan Suri's attorneys who argued that, A, he has not been charged with anything nor are [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=218.08s)]
*  there allegations. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  He has been moved from Virginia to Louisiana, where he's being held now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  His attorneys said that they fear he could potentially be sent to a migrant detention [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=227.64s)]
*  center near the U.S.-Mexico border, where then he would likely be deported from back to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=231.76s)]
*  India. His wife is a U.S. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=236.48s)]
*  citizen who is here. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=238.44s)]
*  The government alleges that potentially family members of hers were affiliated or have been [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=239.88s)]
*  affiliated affiliated with Hamas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=244.28s)]
*  And thus, because of her potentially outspoken views, and there really has not been evidence [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=246.44s)]
*  proven in a court of law or shown or filed yet from the government as to this, but that he [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=251.44s)]
*  and his wife were maybe espousing some allegations about Hamas and criticizing Israel for [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=256.0s)]
*  the war over there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=262.08s)]
*  He has three children. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=265.12s)]
*  And basically, as he was walking into his house a couple of days ago, he was arrested by [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=266.2s)]
*  hooded ICE agents, or Department of Homeland Security agents, who wore masks. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=271.12s)]
*  They grabbed him. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=275.8s)]
*  He was able to say goodbye to his wife as she handed over his passport to these attorney or [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=277.04s)]
*  to these agents. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=281.8s)]
*  And then he was brought to this facility. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=282.96s)]
*  So there's certainly more to come on this. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=285.44s)]
*  This is very similar to the cases that we've seen all across the country so far of people who [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  are here on visas who have been outspoken about the U.S.'s handling and Israel's handling of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=291.12s)]
*  the war in Gaza and Israel and will be certain to keep you posted on what further developments [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=296.32s)]
*  happen and whether a judge gets involved at some point today or tomorrow to potentially try to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=301.92s)]
*  block this release, as we saw in the case of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia student in New [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=305.72s)]
*  York. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the president and secretary of state Marco Rubio have both said to expect more arrest [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  like this. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=314.48s)]
*  Finally, Jake, yesterday, a federal judge declined to block the Department of Government [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=315.6s)]
*  Efficiencies efforts to take over the U.S. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=319.44s)]
*  Institute for Peace amid some legal challenges. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  What more can you tell us about that? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=325.64000000000004s)]
*  Right. There was an emergency hearing yesterday after late last week and over the weekend. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=329.04s)]
*  Doge officials and we worked with law enforcement and the FBI and Metropolitan Police here in [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=332.84000000000003s)]
*  Washington to go into this U.S. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=337.68s)]
*  Institute of Peace, which is a peace building and peacekeeping organization that is handled [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=340.36s)]
*  and run by the U.S. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  government. The board of that organization can be appointed by the president and as in a [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=346.2s)]
*  differentiator from the other legal cases in which we've seen this takeover, the judge [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=352.08s)]
*  ruled that there were issues with the way that this was this case was handled in terms of who [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  actually was the defendant and what the president Trump's power to either disband or [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=361.68s)]
*  reorganize the group is. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=366.08s)]
*  She said that Doge's handling was completely inappropriate. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  However, she decided to not block their access to the building for now. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=371.08s)]
*  So we've seen, again, another government institution, government agency takeover by [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=374.96s)]
*  Elon Musk and his allies in Doge. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=379.67999999999995s)]
*  Again, certainly more to come on this front, too, as other of these other independent [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=382.2s)]
*  agencies may be more on the fringe, not necessarily cabinet administration. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=386.03999999999996s)]
*  Cabinet level buildings have been taken over. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=389.76s)]
*  Jake Rosen, I know you're going to be keeping an eye on that for us. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=392.55999999999995s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3yoR5Q6K2M&t=395.08s)]
