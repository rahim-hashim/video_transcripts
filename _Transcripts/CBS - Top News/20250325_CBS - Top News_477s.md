# Russia, Ukraine appear to agree on some Black Sea points after Saudi Arabia talks
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk)
*  We also heard about talks between the United States and Ukraine today, Russia as well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=0.0s)]
*  So we want to talk about that right now because we know that in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, there [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=6.08s)]
*  was no announcement on getting a ceasefire agreement in place in Ukraine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=11.88s)]
*  But at the same time, key agreements have been reached between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  It says Russia and Ukraine have agreed on several points, including ensuring safe navigation [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=21.18s)]
*  of vessels in the Black Sea, helping to facilitate prisoner exchanges, developing measures to [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=27.62s)]
*  implement the agreements between President Trump and President Putin to ban strikes on [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=34.3s)]
*  energy facilities in both of those countries and to work toward achieving a durable and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=39.42s)]
*  lasting peace. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=44.5s)]
*  Let's turn now to CBS News senior national security correspondent, Charlie Daggadah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=45.82s)]
*  Charlie, we have these agreements reached between Russia and Ukraine, but how could [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=50.02s)]
*  those steps be effective in an effort to end this war? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=54.46s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm just reading through some of the details now, and the devil will be [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=59.06s)]
*  in the details because it's sort of broad strokes. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=64.74s)]
*  I think it's important when they talk about opening up those shipping lanes because this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=66.98s)]
*  is an area, and I've been there myself, especially in the early part of the war, it became a [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=70.62s)]
*  chokehold. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=74.86s)]
*  There was a lot of fighting going on there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=75.86s)]
*  Russia was trying to take over Ukrainian ports, but it was kind of shooting them both in the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=78.3s)]
*  foot because they both needed those shipping lanes open. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=82.34s)]
*  It also means that the Ukraine, at least in theory, if not in practice, won't open fire [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=84.74s)]
*  on Russian ships in the straits near the Black Sea. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=91.02s)]
*  That's very important because they have been vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=94.88s)]
*  As far as the other cooperation levels there, you know, there is some reason to see a glimmer [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=98.58s)]
*  of hope by virtue of the fact that there is progress to be made. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=103.96s)]
*  For several of these things, they've come away with neither side making any progress [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=108.7s)]
*  at all. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=113.46s)]
*  At the same time, however, the fighting is continuing there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=114.46s)]
*  So I think what we want to look at, there seems to be willing from the Ukrainian side [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=117.26s)]
*  and some progress going forward, and the Ukrainians have said all along, Zelensky said, we're not [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=122.04s)]
*  the ones staying in the way of peace. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=126.62s)]
*  It'll be interesting and imperative to see where Russia stands on some of these more [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=129.1s)]
*  critical terms of it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=133.46s)]
*  Because we have to remember, rewind just about a week ago, President Trump essentially asked [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=135.57999999999998s)]
*  Putin for a ceasefire, having gained one from President Zelensky, he came away with something [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=142.22s)]
*  a little bit less than that, saying we're not going to go after each other's energy [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=147.5s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=151.33999999999997s)]
*  And aside from an attack that night, that has held. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=152.33999999999997s)]
*  So again, this is progress. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=155.94s)]
*  We haven't seen progress in three years. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=157.61999999999998s)]
*  So I think this is a glimmer of hope in this carefully worded statement that we got today. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=159.29999999999998s)]
*  And we'll see what else comes next. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  Charlie, I know you've been listening to that Senate hearing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=166.58s)]
*  Still that big question of how, I know I see you shaking your head there, how a journalist [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=170.54000000000002s)]
*  was invited to this conversation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=175.24s)]
*  What is your takeaway from that hearing? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=177.3s)]
*  Okay, there was so much to unpack there. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=179.5s)]
*  They went great guns after CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Telsey Gabbard, Director of National [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  Intelligence, they were both part of that chat. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=189.46s)]
*  They both admitted to being part of that chat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  Somewhat reluctantly, particularly Telsey Gabbard, who said in the beginning, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=194.86s)]
*  she refused to be acknowledged in terms of her involvement. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=199.58s)]
*  And she kept making the statement that says, I don't want to discuss this in this environment. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=202.94s)]
*  Pressed more by the Senator saying, well, wait a minute, why don't you want to discuss [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=208.86s)]
*  this? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=212.94s)]
*  If it was classified information or sensitive information, we understand that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=213.94s)]
*  But what you're arguing and what Secretary Hegsett has argued is this wasn't classified [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=218.18s)]
*  information. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=223.58s)]
*  This wasn't a war plan, that this has been amplified or exaggerated by the Atlantic and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=224.58s)]
*  Jeff Goldberg. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=231.42000000000002s)]
*  We have seen some of that, you know, some of what the Atlantic has made public. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=233.06s)]
*  And that in itself sort of hints at sensitive information. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=238.22000000000003s)]
*  Certainly I would be reluctant to share that kind of information if I were to be, Jeff, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=243.5s)]
*  particular chat, because he's talking about weapons systems, weapons packagings. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=250.46s)]
*  He's talking about the sequencing and targeting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=254.74s)]
*  These are very critical bits of information. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=257.26s)]
*  And I would imagine they would be classified bits of information. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=260.94s)]
*  I mean, I'll just tell you, for example, okay, we use the signal system. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=263.3s)]
*  I use them with sources here, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=268.7s)]
*  So the military, the Pentagon uses it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=270.7s)]
*  They use it between service members. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=272.3s)]
*  It's approved in that manner. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=274.52s)]
*  No way do you speak about even something as innocuous as troop movements, even that would [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=277.06s)]
*  be considered classified. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=281.74s)]
*  You would no way, no way share any of that information about an ongoing battle, about [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=284.9s)]
*  target acquisition, about the sequencing of those targets, because it's, aside from being [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=290.82s)]
*  outlawed, they are told specifically not to use systems like signal for that kind of information. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=297.42s)]
*  I mean, they'd be fired, or worse, court-martialed, because it gives the adversary or the enemy [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=306.26000000000005s)]
*  the opportunity to essentially know where you're coming. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=313.86s)]
*  The first wave of attacks is always going to take out the targets that might put your [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=316.26000000000005s)]
*  own forces in a vulnerable situation. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=321.18s)]
*  So you want air defenses out of the way. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  You want radar bases out of the way. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=324.86s)]
*  You want command and control centers out of the way to cripple the adversary's capability [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=327.66s)]
*  of striking your personnel, your pilots, fighter jets, et cetera. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=333.5s)]
*  That's the kind of information that not only you don't want falling into the hands of somebody [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=340.1s)]
*  like the Houthis, who perhaps don't have the capacity or capability to fire back at a fighter [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=343.86s)]
*  jet flying at 35,000 feet. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=349.98s)]
*  However, Iran, if they were to get across that, or Russia, or China, then it becomes [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=352.98s)]
*  critical mass, right? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=360.12s)]
*  Then it becomes a national security issue. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=361.44s)]
*  One thing that was interesting here, and I genuinely don't want to overstep here because [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=363.96000000000004s)]
*  they're treating it so carefully because they know this is all going to be addressed. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=369.24s)]
*  I don't know whether there's going to be an investigation, but as the meeting went on, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=372.88s)]
*  or as that briefing went on, they started to put more, I don't know if blame is the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=377.32s)]
*  right word, but more responsibility in the hands of the Secretary of Defense. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=382.2s)]
*  John Ratcliffe, CIA director, said that original classification, so the person who essentially [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=387.88s)]
*  owned the information that was going into the chat, that would have been classified [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  or released by the Secretary of Defense. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=399.68s)]
*  They mentioned a couple things. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=404.12s)]
*  I get it here a lot. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=405.44s)]
*  There's something called controlled unclassified. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=406.84000000000003s)]
*  That is where you have information that isn't necessarily available to the public. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=410.36s)]
*  It might be for the edification of journalists that we can't then publish or broadcast on, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=414.32s)]
*  so it's controlled classification. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=419.56s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see if that's the sort of designation that they used for that [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=421.44s)]
*  information that came out of that chat. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=425.56s)]
*  Again, I've only seen what you've seen. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=427.48s)]
*  The stuff that's out there, the reports that's out there. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  However, the Atlantic said, we've seen a lot more than that, and they wouldn't feel comfortable. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=432.44s)]
*  Interestingly, one of the senators said, if everything inside that report, or inside [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=437.08s)]
*  that chat, is considered unclassified, would you be okay with the original report coming [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=442.04s)]
*  out with all of that chat? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=449.08s)]
*  All of what he learned? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=451.84s)]
*  And they said they weren't entirely comfortable, not even from a legal position. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=453.88s)]
*  And I think there's the rub. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=458.0s)]
*  That's where we're going to start figuring out, was this innocuous? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=459.5s)]
*  Was it unclassified? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=463.44s)]
*  That's where we're going to get the answers. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=466.12s)]
*  And I'm sure this is not over yet at all. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=468.92s)]
*  Charlie Daggadah, thank you so much for joining us on the stream. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NY_mlPVDFk&t=471.32s)]
