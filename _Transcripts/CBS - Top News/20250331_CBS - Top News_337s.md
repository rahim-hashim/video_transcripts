# Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates on outside money coming into race
**CBS - Top News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, a special election will determine the Wisconsin Supreme Court's ideological [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=2.0s)]
*  makeup. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=7.0s)]
*  Now, strictly, this is a nonpartisan election. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=8.0s)]
*  But behind that gloss, both parties have drawn a line, and their voters will have a choice [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=10.56s)]
*  between the Democratic-backed candidate Susan Crawford and the Republican-backed candidate [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=15.24s)]
*  Brad Schimel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=20.28s)]
*  The contest has already become the most expensive, as we mentioned, going to break judicial race [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=26.400000000000002s)]
*  And it includes massive donations from George Soros on the left, Elon Musk on the right, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  but lots of other grassroots donors have involved themselves as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=32.08s)]
*  Now, Musk did something in this race he did in the general election last year, handing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  out million-dollar payments via lottery to voters, or potential voters. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=42.36s)]
*  The state Supreme Court refused to hear a petition from Wisconsin's Democratic Attorney [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=47.2s)]
*  General to stop those checks from being handed out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=51.3s)]
*  Our Ed O'Keefe joins us now, I'm happy to say, from Wisconsin. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=55.04s)]
*  Ed, great to see you, I'm glad you're there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  You spoke to the candidates, what did they tell you? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=60.72s)]
*  Well, we focused a lot of the conversation, Major, on the fact that so much money from [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=63.12s)]
*  out of state is being spent on this race. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=68.92s)]
*  As you mentioned, Elon Musk combined roughly $15 million now between personal donations [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=71.4s)]
*  and money that his PAC has donated, including those million-dollar checks he gave out last [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=77.16s)]
*  night. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=80.68s)]
*  The state Supreme Court, where a seat is up for grabs, declined to rule on the legality [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=82.64s)]
*  of him doing that and allowed him to move forward with it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=86.12s)]
*  Then you got several million from guys like George Soros, Reid Hoffman, six-figure sums [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=88.76s)]
*  from people like Reid Hoffman. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  J.B. Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, has given a million and a half to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=94.48s)]
*  the state party that got transferred into this race as well, so lots of big money from [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  out of state. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  We talked to Susan Crawford, then Brad Schimel, about money in this judicial race. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=103.16000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=107.52000000000001s)]
*  Part of the reason, really the only reason we're here is because while this is a statewide [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=109.36s)]
*  race, it has drawn tens of millions of dollars from across the country, primarily from a [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=114.08s)]
*  handful of wealthy people on both sides. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=118.8s)]
*  No, that's actually not true. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=120.6s)]
*  Well, you have Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who donated a bunch of money to the state [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=122.28s)]
*  party that got funneled to your campaign. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=125.32s)]
*  You've got George Soros, who donated a lot of money to the state party that got funneled [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  to your campaign. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=130.76s)]
*  Let me just point out one fact, okay? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=131.76s)]
*  The amount of money that Elon Musk has spent in the last eight weeks exceeds what my campaign [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  has raised in the last 10 months over the entire course of the campaign. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=141.23999999999998s)]
*  It is not comparable whatsoever. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  But there's money from both sides coming in from the outside. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  Certainly, but my average campaign contribution is $107. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  So that's, we've received tens of thousands of contributions from ordinary people, twice [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=155.48s)]
*  as many Wisconsinites have contributed to my campaign as have contributed to Brad Schimmel's [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=160.84s)]
*  campaign. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=166.0s)]
*  And we've gotten thousands of small contributions from Americans all across the country who [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=167.0s)]
*  are really concerned about Elon Musk as the richest man in the world being able to come [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=172.0s)]
*  in and buy a state judicial seat. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=177.8s)]
*  The accusation that he's spending tens of millions of dollars to buy a seat and that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  you're the guy that's going to help him do that, you say... [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=187.56s)]
*  You'd have to ask him why he spent all this money. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=192.32s)]
*  I didn't ask for it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=196.16s)]
*  I didn't know that that was going to happen. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  Like I think I said, it's hard to get your message out to all the voters in Wisconsin. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=201.72s)]
*  Even though I've campaigned in all 72 counties and I've been doing it for a long time, it [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=208.72s)]
*  is hard to get your message to everybody. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=212.76s)]
*  So when that help comes in, I'm grateful for it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=215.08s)]
*  As long as that help isn't pretending I'm going to do anything that I wouldn't do. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=217.68s)]
*  So you know, this is a race to determine the ideological balance of a major high state court [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=226.12s)]
*  in a battleground state where issues like abortion rights, labor union rights, congressional [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=232.06s)]
*  redistricting and election law are all going to come before it in the coming years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  The kind of thing that might make you go hmm, is the fact that two judges who should perhaps [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=243.44s)]
*  be focused mostly on that issue have been consumed by questions from voters and from [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  reporters about the amount of money being spent to put one of them on this court, Major. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=254.04s)]
*  And it's just a really vivid example of how this has become a proxy fight between supporters [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=259.64s)]
*  and detractors of President Trump, most especially because Elon Musk got involved the way he [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=265.56s)]
*  did. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  To that point, Ed, is there any danger in overreading the outcome of tomorrow's election [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  and its implications nationally for Trump, Musk, Republicans or Democrats? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  If the Democrats can hold on to this and maintain the 4-3 ideological balance, status quo is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=282.72s)]
*  maintained but it might be a shot in the arm to Democrats who go okay, okay, we figured [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=287.36s)]
*  out a way to hold on to a key thing in a big battleground state. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=291.92s)]
*  If the Republican Brad Schimel takes it with Musk's money, then you know his pack and he [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=295.20000000000005s)]
*  himself are going to get calls from across the country from Republican candidates of [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=299.64000000000004s)]
*  all sorts saying please come play in my backyard too because you may be the key to victory. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=303.12s)]
*  But otherwise, this is a race for a seat on the high court in a Midwestern state that's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  going to deal with issues of concern to this state. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=314.04s)]
*  But given it's a presidential battleground, given issues like abortion rights, voting [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=316.8s)]
*  rights, labor rights are galvanizing in battleground states like this one, it's gotten all this [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=321.68s)]
*  attention and could very well throw the race either way. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=326.96s)]
*  That is why we're happy to have Ed O'Keefe in Wisconsin. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=331.48s)]
*  All the beat knowledge you could possibly want. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=333.8s)]
*  Ed, thanks so very much. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmbUHXaTc5k&t=335.88s)]
