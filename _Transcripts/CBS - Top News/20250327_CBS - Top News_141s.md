# Trump says world needs U.S. takeover of Greenland
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM)
*  This morning, Denmark's prime minister has praised the people of Greenland for their resilience, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=0.0s)]
*  amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to take control of the semi-autonomous Danish territory. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=5.2s)]
*  President Trump reiterated his desire for a U.S. takeover of Greenland in the Oval Office yesterday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  We need Greenland and the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=17.6s)]
*  Denmark has to have us have Greenland. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=22.8s)]
*  The comments come ahead of a visit to the territory by Vice President JD Vance. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=25.8s)]
*  CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent Holly Williams has more for us from Greenland. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=30.8s)]
*  We've heard President Trump talk a lot in recent months about taking over Greenland. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=35.8s)]
*  So we came here to find out why he wants this remote place to become U.S. territory. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=41.8s)]
*  Now, Greenland is roughly three times the size of Texas, mostly covered in ice sheet, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=46.8s)]
*  with a population of about 56,000, mostly Inuit who are indigenous to this place. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=52.8s)]
*  And for now, it is a semi-autonomous part of Denmark, which is one of America's NATO allies. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=58.8s)]
*  The U.S. military base that Vice President Vance and the second lady will visit [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=65.8s)]
*  is about a thousand miles north of here, Greenland's capital, Nuuk, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=69.8s)]
*  and a very long way from where most Greenlanders live. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=73.8s)]
*  That base could help protect the U.S. from ballistic missiles if it's attacked [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=77.8s)]
*  because the shortest route for Russian missiles to hit the U.S. would be via the Arctic. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=81.8s)]
*  Now, President Trump says he wants to take control of Greenland for security reasons [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=86.8s)]
*  and he's refused to rule out using force. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=91.8s)]
*  Some important background to that is that the U.S. and Russia are vying for military dominance in the Arctic [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=94.8s)]
*  and climate change is melting the ice and making lucrative mineral reserves more accessible here in Greenland. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=100.8s)]
*  Some people here have told us they believe what Trump really wants is Greenland's natural resources [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=107.8s)]
*  and they do not trust him. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=112.8s)]
*  A recent poll here found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=114.8s)]
*  This is not the first time the U.S. has tried to take over Greenland, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=120.8s)]
*  though in the past it's been via negotiation. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=125.8s)]
*  The U.S. even offered Denmark $100 million for Greenland back in 1946, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=128.8s)]
*  equivalent to more than a billion dollars today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=133.8s)]
*  Though that offer was firmly rejected. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=136.8s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9LMv0POyXM&t=139.8s)]
