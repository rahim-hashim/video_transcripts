Video Description: On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended 68 bridges in the U.S. be evaluated for risk of collapse from a vessel strike. The recommendation comes nearly one year after a container ship destroyed Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge. CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave has more.

# NTSB calls for reviews of 68 bridges to assess collapse risk from vessel strike
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU)
*  Nearly one year after a cargo ship struck the Baltimore-Francis Scott Key Bridge, triggering its collapse and killing six people, the NTSB issues an urgent safety recommendation. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=0.0s)]
*  So CBS News senior transportation correspondent Chris Van Cleave joining us now. Chris, thanks for being here. You know so many Americans drive over bridges each and every day. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=11.0s)]
*  The Golden Gate Bridge directly behind you. What needs to be done to make sure these bridges are safe? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=19.0s)]
*  Well, the NTSB says fundamentally an assessment that has been recommended since 1991 needs to be done. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=25.0s)]
*  And that's basically a series of math problems to figure out what level of risk those 68 bridges would have in the event of a vessel strike, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=32.0s)]
*  meaning they got hit by a large vessel like a cargo ship as we saw play out in Baltimore. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=41.0s)]
*  And these are significant bridges. We're talking about the Golden Gate Bridge, the Coronado Bridge in San Diego, the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=46.0s)]
*  the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland. These are significant bridges. We're talking about millions of people that drive across these 68 bridges every day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=53.0s)]
*  So to not know the answer to that vulnerability, the NTSB feels presents an urgent safety risk. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=61.0s)]
*  Just the not knowing is significant enough to push the owners of those bridges to take action. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah, Chris, the NTSB said this assessment really is nothing new. So what went wrong here and why have so many of the country's most traveled bridges [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=73.0s)]
*  never been assessed for collision? Well, so this assessment criteria is put together by the Association of Transportation Authorities, basically. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=81.0s)]
*  It is not a federal regulation. So there's not a mandate to do it on bridges older than 1991, bridges that were built before 1991. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=91.0s)]
*  So there was no enforcement mechanism to be done. Now, the NTSB says had the Maryland Transportation Authority done this calculation, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=100.0s)]
*  they would have known the Francis Scott Key Bridge was 30 times over the acceptable risk threshold for a collision and could then have taken action to build in the protections [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=108.0s)]
*  around that bridge to prevent something like this from happening. And we visited a bridge about 90 minutes from that one that is doing that project right now, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=118.0s)]
*  spending almost $100 million to protect the bridge against a potential strike from a large cargo ship because they knew their bridge might not withstand that kind of impact. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=128.0s)]
*  All right. It is an urgent safety recommendation by the NTSB. Chris Van Cleef, thank you so much. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDF3Y8hcmGU&t=137.0s)]
