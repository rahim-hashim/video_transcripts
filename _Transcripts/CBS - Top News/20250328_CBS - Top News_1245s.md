# Trump reacts to Myanmar earthquake as he comments on Canada tariffs, Stefanik bid and Greenland
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts)
*  Moments ago, President Donald Trump just started taking questions at an Oval Office ceremony [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=0.0s)]
*  just when Alina Habba as interim Attorney General for New Jersey. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=6.2s)]
*  So let's listen into what to what he's saying. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=10.36s)]
*  Do you have any questions? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=12.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Canada's prime minister says that they will be implementing retaliatory [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=14.32s)]
*  tariffs. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=19.36s)]
*  You said that were to happen that you would be responding with large scale tariffs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=20.36s)]
*  Will you be following through with that promise? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=24.84s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=27.639999999999997s)]
*  But we had a very good conversation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  Mark called me today at 10 o'clock. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  We put out a statement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=34.92s)]
*  We had a very, very good talk. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=35.92s)]
*  He's going through an election now and we'll see what happens. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=37.2s)]
*  But we are we have Liberation Day, as you know, on April 2nd because and I'm not referring [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=41.04s)]
*  to Canada, but many countries have taken advantage of us, the likes of which nobody even thought [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=48.4s)]
*  was possible for many, many decades, for decades. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=53.54s)]
*  And you know, that has to stop. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=57.26s)]
*  We're going to end up with a very good relationship with Canada and a lot of the other countries. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=59.38s)]
*  Some we probably won't. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  It won't be so pleasant. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=64.02s)]
*  But with I think most countries who will are agreeing with me, they actually many of them [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=66.18s)]
*  have actually apologized. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=72.26s)]
*  They said, look, we have taken advantage. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=73.86s)]
*  And I don't blame them as much as I blame the people that stood in this case. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  I can say the men because so far they've been all men, haven't they? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=81.34s)]
*  But the men that sat right there and behind the resolute desk, mostly the resolute desk, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=85.02s)]
*  you know, I don't know if you know, you have a choice of seven desks. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=90.1s)]
*  The resolute is the one I like, but some chose other ones. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=94.38s)]
*  But they sat right behind a desk right in this location and they let our country be [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=98.24s)]
*  hurt very badly. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=104.58s)]
*  But I didn't do that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=106.5s)]
*  But we had a very good talk, the prime minister and myself. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=108.06s)]
*  And I think things are going to work out very well between Canada and the United States. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=111.72s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=115.66s)]
*  Mr. President, how are the talks with India tariff going on? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=116.66s)]
*  And what is the expectation from India? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=120.9s)]
*  How much do you want? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=122.42s)]
*  Well, you know, Prime Minister Modi was here just recently and we we've always been very [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=123.42s)]
*  good friends. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=127.78s)]
*  India is one of the highest tariffing nations in the world. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=129.58s)]
*  You know that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=132.9s)]
*  Thank you for shaking your head, but it's it's brutal. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=134.3s)]
*  It's brutal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=137.78s)]
*  They're very smart. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=138.78s)]
*  And he's a very smart man and a great friend of mine, actually. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=140.22s)]
*  We had very good talks. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=144.38s)]
*  I think it's going to work out very well between India and our country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=146.28s)]
*  Very, very well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=149.58s)]
*  And I want to say you have a great prime minister. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=150.58s)]
*  Mr. President, there's been a very serious earthquake in Burma on Myanmar today with [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=152.46s)]
*  up to several hundred killed. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=158.18s)]
*  The military regime that has asked for help from anybody. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=160.82s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to be helping. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  You've already alerted the people. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=164.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible what's happened. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=166.57999999999998s)]
*  It's helping. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=167.9s)]
*  We've already spoken with the country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=170.34s)]
*  Okay, please. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, yesterday you asked Representative Stefanik to stay in her [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  seat. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=177.74s)]
*  Can you explain your reason for that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=178.74s)]
*  And did it have anything to do with the tight polling in the Florida district that former [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=179.74s)]
*  Representative Waltz held? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=185.26s)]
*  Well, I think we're doing. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=186.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=188.54s)]
*  As you know, we have a few elections going on and she is phenomenal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  Number one, she is a friend of mine and she was going to go to the United Nations and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=194.22s)]
*  they said, look, there's a lot of room for doing that or something else. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=197.54s)]
*  But she's very popular in her district and I didn't want to take a chance. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=202.48s)]
*  I don't even know who else is running. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=205.82s)]
*  I assume somebody else would have been running. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=207.7s)]
*  But if she runs, she can't be. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=209.94s)]
*  You never want to say can't be beaten, but I think can't be beaten. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  She's very, very well liked and very smart. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=215.74s)]
*  And I said, at least would you do me a favor? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=220.18s)]
*  We can we cannot take a chance. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  We have a slim margin. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=224.5s)]
*  We don't want to take any chances. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=226.36s)]
*  We don't want to experiment. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  And she polls like I do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  I won her district, as you know, by a lot of points. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  And she also does very well there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=235.36s)]
*  When it comes to Florida, you have two races and they seem to be good. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=236.98000000000002s)]
*  It's a Trump plus 32 area. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=242.74s)]
*  The one thing is they're spending like 12 million dollars and our candidate doesn't [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=245.94s)]
*  have that kind of money spending much less than that, like maybe one twelfth, about a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=249.3s)]
*  million dollars, a little bit more than a million dollars. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=254.62s)]
*  So the airwaves are blanketed. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=257.28000000000003s)]
*  And you never know what happens in a case like that. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=260.18s)]
*  I won it by 32 points. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=262.38s)]
*  And it's very, very strong. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=264.94s)]
*  It used to be Democrat. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=266.38s)]
*  But when I came along, they liked me for whatever reason. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=268.26s)]
*  I will have to explain that, but they like me. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=271.9s)]
*  We're way up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=273.58s)]
*  But you don't know what happened. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=274.9s)]
*  Second district, who seems to be in pretty good shape, but likewise, he's being outspent [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=278.38s)]
*  about five to one. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=283.12s)]
*  So we don't want to take any chances. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=284.86s)]
*  So I went to Elise and I said, Elise, do you mind? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=286.38s)]
*  Very highly rated person. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=290.78s)]
*  You know, she was a real leader and she will be again. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=292.82s)]
*  I spoke with Mike Johnson. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=295.9s)]
*  They're going to put her in a high leadership position. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=296.9s)]
*  Will you mind staying in Congress? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=299.06s)]
*  Because we don't want to take any chances. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=301.42s)]
*  And it's as simple as that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=303.18s)]
*  It's basic politics. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=304.94s)]
*  It's politics 101. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  She's very popular. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=307.62s)]
*  She's going to win. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=308.62s)]
*  And somebody else will probably win too, because we did very well there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=309.62s)]
*  I did very well there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=312.9s)]
*  But the word probably is no good. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=313.94s)]
*  So I really appreciate her doing it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=316.76s)]
*  She's doing me a big favor when she does it, because she was all set to go to the United [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=320.06s)]
*  She would have dealt with Putin and Zelensky and everybody else, and she would have been [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=325.61999999999995s)]
*  very effective. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  But we really want to don't we don't want to take any chances because it is tight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=331.09999999999997s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=335.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  You and your team apprehended a top three leader in the violent gang and this 13 yesterday, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=339.85999999999996s)]
*  just 30 minutes outside of Washington, D.C. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=344.82s)]
*  What has made you and your team so effective in finding, locating, apprehending and deporting [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=347.5s)]
*  these violent, illegal migrants? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=353.74s)]
*  I love this guy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=355.38000000000005s)]
*  I wish more people would ask questions like that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=358.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=361.42s)]
*  That's very nice. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=362.42s)]
*  And they happen. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=363.42s)]
*  All you're doing is being fair with you when you ask a question in that way. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=364.42s)]
*  Pam Bondi and Kash Patel and all of the rest of law enforcement. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=368.58000000000004s)]
*  I think we have to include ICE and Border Patrol. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=372.98s)]
*  You know, Paul of Border Patrol, the whole group from Border Patrol, they're so incredible. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=375.90000000000003s)]
*  And it's dangerous stuff, hard stuff. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=381.18s)]
*  And it's really an unforced error because these people were allowed into this country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=384.34000000000003s)]
*  They shouldn't have been in this country. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=389.06s)]
*  They would have never been in this country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  We're getting rid of some of the worst criminals in the world. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=391.94s)]
*  They came out of jails and mental institutions from all over the world. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=394.72s)]
*  But Pam and the whole group and Kash, who's here and so good to have him. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=399.4s)]
*  He's I see him all over. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=404.42s)]
*  He's working 24 hours a day. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=405.94s)]
*  But the job they've done is incredible. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=408.06s)]
*  And they caught one of the worst criminals in the world, I guess, in terms of evilness. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=410.74s)]
*  You don't get any worse than the MS-13 guys and the Trent D'Iragua guys. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=417.9s)]
*  You could flip a coin. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=423.5s)]
*  It's a rough group. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=424.5s)]
*  And you know, the big thing is they have to be able to do their job. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=426.21999999999997s)]
*  I know I saw I was watching it on television like you and I saw the home that he lived [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=429.7s)]
*  in a good area. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=436.34s)]
*  But boy, they had a lot of weaponry in there, right? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=437.34s)]
*  Highly sophisticated, really brutal stuff. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=439.38s)]
*  So I appreciate the question. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=442.54s)]
*  And I just want to thank Kash and Pam and the whole group for doing a fantastic and [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=445.3s)]
*  the local law enforcement has been so terrific. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=449.65999999999997s)]
*  And even first responders. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=452.54s)]
*  So I want to thank everybody. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=455.7s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, happy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=458.21999999999997s)]
*  I want to say, first of all, happy Women's Month. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=459.21999999999997s)]
*  You do so much for women by, first of all, keeping men out of women's sports and you [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=463.26s)]
*  platform so many. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=467.58s)]
*  It was an easy one. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=468.62s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=469.62s)]
*  You platform so many great women like your chief of chief of staff, Susie Wiles. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=470.62s)]
*  You also have Caroline Levin doing a great job as press secretary. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=474.46s)]
*  Now Alina will be joining as well. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=477.41999999999996s)]
*  Since Democrats seem to struggle answering this question, I wanted to ask you, what is [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=479.38s)]
*  a woman and why is it important that we understand the difference between men and women? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=482.9s)]
*  Well, it's sort of easy to answer for me because a woman is somebody that can have a baby under [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=486.5s)]
*  certain circumstances. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=491.94s)]
*  She has a quality. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=494.62s)]
*  A woman is a person who's much smarter than a man I've always had. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=496.22s)]
*  A woman is a person that doesn't give a man even a chance of success. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=501.3s)]
*  And a woman's a person that in many cases has been treated very badly because I think [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=505.94s)]
*  that what happens with this crazy, this crazy issue of men being able to play in women's [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=509.98s)]
*  sports is just ridiculous and very unfair to women and very demeaning to women. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=516.86s)]
*  And that's got to be about a 94 percent, I read today it was a 94 percent issue and I [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=522.06s)]
*  watched the other day, I watched congressmen, a Democrat congressman fighting for the fact [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=526.62s)]
*  that men should be allowed to compete essentially in women's sports. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=533.38s)]
*  And I say I hope they keep that going because they'll never win another election. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=538.9s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=543.26s)]
*  But women are basically incredible people, do so much for our country and we love, we [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=544.26s)]
*  love our women and we're going to take care of our women. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=549.54s)]
*  Mr. President, what was your reason for pardoning Trevor Milton? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=552.58s)]
*  Highly recommended by many people that was taken advantage of. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=558.34s)]
*  He did a business deal like in Utah as I have it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=564.5s)]
*  And I think he was exonerated and then they brought him into New York where he had a rough, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=569.3000000000001s)]
*  rough road and road. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=576.46s)]
*  He was exonerated. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=578.94s)]
*  It was a big celebration. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=579.94s)]
*  Again, I don't know him, but I was, they say it was very unfair and they say the thing [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=581.58s)]
*  that he did wrong was he was one of the first people that supported a gentleman named Donald [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=587.34s)]
*  Trump for president. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=592.5400000000001s)]
*  He supported Trump, he liked Trump. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=594.62s)]
*  I didn't know him, but he liked him. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=596.6600000000001s)]
*  It was in Utah and they went after him, they went after his family, they went after his [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=598.5400000000001s)]
*  businesses and he was, I believe, exonerated and then they went after him again and they [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=602.82s)]
*  brought him this time into Manhattan and he had nothing to do with Manhattan and they [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=609.74s)]
*  got him and I said that's unfair. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=615.34s)]
*  There are many people like that. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=617.42s)]
*  They support Trump and they went after him. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=619.5s)]
*  You don't realize this is a vicious group of people that were in this office before [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=621.66s)]
*  us. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=625.42s)]
*  This is a vicious group. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=626.42s)]
*  They're violent. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=627.42s)]
*  What they were doing to people and you could go story after hundreds and even thousands [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=629.02s)]
*  of stories and they went after this man and when I heard about it, I said, nope, not [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=635.58s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=642.74s)]
*  They persecuted, they destroyed five years of his life. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=643.74s)]
*  He went fought for five years of his life and he did nothing wrong and he's a good [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=647.1s)]
*  person and basically I had these fantastic recommendations about him from people that [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=651.58s)]
*  you know very well, all top of the line people. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=658.1s)]
*  They thought it was a horrible thing. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=660.74s)]
*  There are many such cases, by the way, many such cases. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=662.9399999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken with the United States about buying weapons from Iran? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=665.66s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=669.3s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=670.3s)]
*  Have you spoken with the United States about buying weapons from Iran and from North Korea? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=671.3s)]
*  Not about specifically that, no. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=676.34s)]
*  Well, that seems to be an issue that you want to make important. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=678.06s)]
*  Well, I'm making all issues important. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=681.54s)]
*  You got a lot of important issues. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=683.98s)]
*  You also have the children issue that's important. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=685.54s)]
*  You know, a lot of children are living in Russia right now. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=687.9s)]
*  It's a horrible situation that would have never taken place if I had not been there [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=692.78s)]
*  and the country is being decimated. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=697.62s)]
*  But you know, they're losing 2,500 on average young men, mostly men, almost in all cases [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=699.5s)]
*  men actually, but young men every single week, 2,500. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=707.5799999999999s)]
*  And they're not from our country. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=712.66s)]
*  They're from Ukraine and they're from Russia. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=713.86s)]
*  But it's human lives and if we can get it stopped and I think we're making progress. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=717.02s)]
*  There's a lot of ill will between the parties. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=722.04s)]
*  Should Americans buy cars now if they want to avoid higher prices? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=725.04s)]
*  And then just a follow-up. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=731.8s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=732.8s)]
*  I think you're going to have a country that's going to boom. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=733.8s)]
*  I just spoke to Tim Cook of Apple. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=735.64s)]
*  He's investing $500 billion in the United States, which he would have never, he told [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=737.76s)]
*  me I would never have done it if you lost the election and I would have never done it [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  if there wasn't a tariff system that is an incentive for people to come and remember [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=747.28s)]
*  there are no tariffs. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=752.44s)]
*  All you have to do is do your work right here. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=753.44s)]
*  If you have your company here, if you build your product, make your product, make your [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=756.62s)]
*  car or whatever it is you're making, no tariffs. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=760.2s)]
*  And we're going to have, I think Scott, I would say we're close to $4 trillion, even [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=763.9s)]
*  going close to $5 trillion. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=768.92s)]
*  Now we haven't had that for years. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=771.4s)]
*  If you add up years, they haven't invested like that. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=775.16s)]
*  And here we are in two months. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=778.42s)]
*  We think we're up to close to $5 trillion of investment. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=779.86s)]
*  They're going to build car plants. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=782.68s)]
*  They're already building. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=783.68s)]
*  Many of them have already started. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=784.9s)]
*  And if you build a car in the United States, and one thing that we just, I just spoke with [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=786.8399999999999s)]
*  John Thune about, I just spoke to Mike Johnson about, Speaker, we're going to do something [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  that has never been done in this country before. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=797.88s)]
*  I'm very proud to say it was my idea. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=800.28s)]
*  So sometimes a simple idea, they say, how do you think of that one? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=802.24s)]
*  It's so simple. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=805.96s)]
*  It was never done. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=806.96s)]
*  If you buy a car in the United States that's made in the United States, if it's manufactured [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=808.08s)]
*  here, when you borrow money, if you borrow money, you have interest payments, we're going [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=813.12s)]
*  to let you deduct the interest payment for income tax reasons. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=817.12s)]
*  And I think that's going to more than pay for itself. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=820.6s)]
*  I think people are going to be, they've never had a deduction. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=823.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, deductions are supposed to be for like rich people, and it's unfair to have [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=826.84s)]

*  on Earth. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=836.5200000000001s)]
*  But, you know, the truth is that people that are middle income people that buy a car and [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=837.5200000000001s)]
*  actually have to borrow money, they're going to now get an interest deduction on their [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=842.4000000000001s)]
*  car if it's made in the United States. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=846.9200000000001s)]
*  If it's made someplace else, that won't take place. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=848.96s)]
*  But car companies, as you know, are already expanding and building new plants. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=852.0400000000001s)]
*  They've already started. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=856.44s)]
*  And I think you're going to see numbers, Howard, you're seeing it, and Scott, you're seeing [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=857.72s)]
*  it. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=863.04s)]
*  You're going to see numbers the likes of which you've never seen before. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=864.04s)]
*  Yeah, please, Scott. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=866.24s)]
*  The Vice President is in Greenland right now. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=867.24s)]
*  Do you have plans to expand U.S. military presence in Greenland? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=871.1999999999999s)]
*  Is that- [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=875.52s)]
*  We get along very well with Greenland. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=876.52s)]
*  We get along very well with Denmark. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=878.76s)]
*  We've always had a good relationship. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=880.48s)]
*  Denmark does a lot of business in the United States. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=881.48s)]
*  We don't do so much there, but they do a lot of business in the United States. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think they want to see- I think everybody wants to see that work out. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=888.08s)]
*  We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=892.52s)]
*  We have to have Greenland. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=898.9200000000001s)]
*  It's not a question of do you think we can do without it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=899.9200000000001s)]
*  We can't. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=902.52s)]
*  If you look at Greenland right now, if you look at the waterways, you have Chinese and [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=903.6s)]
*  Russian ships all over the place. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=907.5s)]
*  And we're not going to be able to do that. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=910.3000000000001s)]
*  We're not relying on Denmark or anybody else to take care of that situation. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=912.48s)]
*  And we're not talking about peace for the United States. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=916.1999999999999s)]
*  We're talking about world peace. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=919.3s)]
*  We're talking about international security. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=920.64s)]
*  And right now, you look at it, you have warships all over the place going through right along [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=923.88s)]
*  Greenland. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=928.7199999999999s)]
*  We're not going to let that happen. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=929.7199999999999s)]
*  We cannot let that happen. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=931.12s)]
*  Or if it's going to happen, we have to be protective of our country. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=933.12s)]
*  And more importantly, really, protection not only of our country, of the world. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=937.16s)]
*  So Greenland is very important. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=942.88s)]
*  Modern day weaponry makes Greenland. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=944.88s)]
*  A hundred years ago, less so. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=946.9200000000001s)]
*  But also, if you notice, also some of those, you could call them roadways, okay, they're [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=950.4000000000001s)]
*  water roadways. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=957.98s)]
*  But some of those areas are opening up and they're opening up icebreakers out there. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=959.38s)]
*  They're opening them. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=964.52s)]
*  And by just nature, they're opening up and they're headed right into China, right into [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=965.52s)]
*  Russia. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=970.9200000000001s)]
*  And we have no choice. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  The answer is he's there with his wonderful wife, Usha. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=973.84s)]
*  They're there right now. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  They landed a couple of hours ago and they will represent us well. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=979.12s)]
*  But Greenland is very important for the peace of the world, not the peace of the entire [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=983.08s)]
*  world. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=988.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think Denmark understands it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=989.4000000000001s)]
*  I think the European Union understands it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=991.12s)]
*  And if they don't, we're going to have to explain it to them. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=994.48s)]
*  Would you like to visit? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=996.2800000000001s)]
*  Would you like to visit Greenland? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=997.2800000000001s)]
*  Iranian drones are attacking Ukraine every day. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=998.28s)]
*  Iranian drones are attacking and killing Ukrainians every day. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1001.64s)]
*  Why aren't you doing something about that? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1005.68s)]
*  Well, we're going to see what happens with that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1007.04s)]
*  I'm getting reports on that and we're looking at a report. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1008.92s)]
*  You're right. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1011.8s)]
*  They make a lot of drones. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1012.8s)]
*  Iran makes a lot of drones. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1014.16s)]
*  They make very effective drones too. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1015.16s)]
*  They do very effectively at some things. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1016.8399999999999s)]
*  But Iran is very high on my list of things to watch. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1019.28s)]
*  And as you probably know, I sent them a letter just recently and I said, you're going to [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1025.68s)]
*  have to make a decision one way or the other. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1031.48s)]
*  And we're going to either have to talk and talk it out or very bad things are going to [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1034.5600000000002s)]
*  happen to Iran. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1038.96s)]
*  And I don't want that to happen. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1040.0s)]
*  I don't want that to happen. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1041.48s)]
*  Big preference. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1043.3200000000002s)]
*  And I don't say this through strength or weakness. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1044.3200000000002s)]
*  My big preference is we work it out with Iran. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  But if we don't work it out, bad, bad things are going to happen to Iran. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1049.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1053.48s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1055.52s)]
*  And you were just hearing from President Donald Trump there at the Oval Office taking questions [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1056.52s)]
*  from reporters. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1063.68s)]
*  We want to turn now to CBS News justice correspondent Scott McFarland. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1064.68s)]
*  And Scott, earlier in that conversation there, that question from the reporters to the president, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1068.44s)]
*  there was a discussion about a settlement between the Trump administration and a law [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1074.76s)]
*  firm. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1079.96s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1080.96s)]
*  That's the Skaden law firm. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1083.04s)]
*  And it's a name that's going to be obscure to a lot of Americans. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1085.28s)]
*  But this is a remarkably large settlement with this law firm. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1088.24s)]
*  A $100 million agreement, according to the president, by the Skaden law firm to provide [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1092.36s)]
*  pro bono, free of charge legal services to issues and parties which the president approves. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1098.04s)]
*  That is a remarkably large number and quite a statement by the law firm, which had been [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1105.32s)]
*  under scrutiny from the president, as have other major law firms you haven't heard of [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1110.52s)]
*  that are still nevertheless huge across America for the cases they've taken in the past. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1114.56s)]
*  The president has concerns with some of the previous cases worked by Skaden, including [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1119.92s)]
*  some of their work in trying to disprove or represent those trying to disprove 2020 election [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1124.3200000000002s)]
*  conspiracies. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1129.92s)]
*  There are other firms, Wilmer Hale. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  There are other firms beyond Wilmer Hale in the last 24 hours who filed suits, including [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1133.8s)]
*  the Jenner firm, trying to stop the president from taking actions against them. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1138.36s)]
*  But this settlement announced by the president is to avert an executive order against the [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1142.9199999999998s)]
*  firm. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1147.8s)]
*  These executive orders being issued by the president against law firms are for all intents [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1148.8s)]
*  and purposes, for business purposes, death sentences for these firms, stripping them [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1153.84s)]
*  of security clearances, stripping them of their ability to go into federal buildings [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1158.6399999999999s)]
*  or do work with federal government employees. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  You simply can't function as a major law firm with those restrictions on you. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1165.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1170.64s)]
*  Scott, I want to ask you what else stood out to you from this remark from the president [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1171.64s)]
*  as well as a question from reporters. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1176.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was noteworthy that he said he was watching on TV, in his words yesterday, when [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1179.16s)]
*  his attorney general, Pam Bondi, announced one of the arrests of what he characterizes [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1184.5600000000002s)]
*  one of the most dangerous criminals in the world. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  The arrest that was announced yesterday has been filed in federal court in Virginia. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1192.68s)]
*  He's an alleged undocumented immigrant accused of having a firearm unlawfully at his home [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1197.52s)]
*  in Prince William County, Virginia. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1201.72s)]
*  The charging documents have not specified why this man, 24 years old, from Virginia, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1203.36s)]
*  is one of the most dangerous people in the world. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1208.52s)]
*  It's a pretty ordinary garden variety felony charge he faces. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1211.12s)]
*  We'll look to hear more information about this case. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1214.28s)]
*  It was announced yesterday morning by his attorney general on television, and the president [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1217.2s)]
*  says he heard about it from there. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1221.68s)]
*  But that's a case that has a lot of questions around it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1224.1200000000001s)]
*  And he also had some pretty tough talk there at the end for Iran as he tries to reset U.S. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1226.0800000000002s)]
*  relations with Iran. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1230.3600000000001s)]
*  The ongoing international affairs of this president include Greenland today, the Soviet [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1232.0800000000002s)]
*  Union, former Soviet Union, Russia, and now Iran. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1237.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1241.2s)]
*  Okay, Scott McFarland, thank you so much for your time and insight there. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvukrFVd5Ts&t=1242.2s)]
