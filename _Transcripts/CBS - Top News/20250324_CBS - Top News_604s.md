# Democratic FTC commissioner speaks out against her firing
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc)
*  Welcome back to America Decides. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=0.0s)]
*  The recent firing of two members of the Federal Trade Commission may be at odds with a 90-year-old [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=1.84s)]
*  Supreme Court ruling limiting presidential power over quasi-independent commissions. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=6.72s)]
*  The two fired Democratic commissioners at the FTC have argued that President Trump violated [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  the legal precedent known as Humphrey's Executor. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=17.52s)]
*  The White House insists that this is a fight it is willing to take on. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=21.8s)]
*  The goal was to let these individuals go. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=26.66s)]
*  If we have to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court, we certainly will. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=28.72s)]
*  One of those commissioners, Rebecca Slaughter, joins me now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=31.64s)]
*  And Rebecca, I know you think of yourself still as a commissioner because you believe [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=34.32s)]
*  this firing was patently illegal. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=37.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=39.6s)]
*  Well, it's not a question of whether it may be in violation of the Supreme Court precedent. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=40.6s)]
*  It is in violation of the Supreme Court precedent. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=45.12s)]
*  The FTC Act, which was passed in 1914, says that the president can only remove an FTC [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=48.0s)]
*  commissioner for cause, specifically for neglect, inefficiency, or malfeasance. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=54.92s)]
*  The president alleged no cause to remove myself or Commissioner Bedoya. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=59.68s)]
*  And in fact, there is no cause to remove us. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=63.68s)]
*  We've been doing our jobs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=65.92s)]
*  So one time, a president did try to remove an FTC commissioner without cause. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=67.84s)]
*  In 1933, President Roosevelt tried to remove then-Commissioner Humphrey because he had [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  disagreements with him over policy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=76.72s)]
*  He was a Republican appointee. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=78.72s)]
*  And Mr. Humphrey sued, challenging the president's decision. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=80.92s)]
*  It went all the way up to the Supreme Court. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=85.32000000000001s)]
*  And a unanimous Supreme Court in 1935 said, in fact, the law prevents that removal and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=87.4s)]
*  the law is constitutional. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  That law has not changed in the intervening 90 years. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm glad you brought that up, that history, that basic history, because it's really, really [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  important. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=103.12s)]
*  I want to read to you what the Federal Trade Commission chairman, Andrew Ferguson, said [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=104.12s)]
*  about your firing. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=108.4s)]
*  President Donald J. Trump is the head of the executive branch and is vested with all of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=111.28s)]
*  the executive power in our government. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=115.80000000000001s)]
*  I have no doubts about his constitutional authority to remove commissioners, which is [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=118.0s)]
*  necessary to ensure democratic accountability for our government. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=122.34s)]
*  I'm going to focus in on that last part, democratic accountability. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is what the people voted for. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=130.0s)]
*  Franklin Delano Roosevelt beat Herbert Hoover in 1932. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=133.39999999999998s)]
*  He won with 57 percent of the vote and he carried 472 electoral votes to Hoover's 59. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=137.32s)]
*  If you are measuring mandates, FDR's was larger by several orders of magnitude than President [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump's victory in the 2024 election. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  And the Supreme Court, knowing clearly of that huge democratic mandate for FDR, still [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  said you can't do it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=158.67999999999998s)]
*  That's not excuse enough to countervene the law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=160.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, listen, I don't actually think it's about the margin of victory. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=163.56s)]
*  President Trump won the election, that is true. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=166.92s)]
*  That doesn't change the laws passed by Congress and the Supreme Court's interpretation of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  those laws. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=174.76s)]
*  And I actually respectfully disagree with Chairman Ferguson about accountability. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=175.76s)]
*  I think the reason the Supreme Court has upheld the FTC Act and other institutions like the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  have been built on similar models is because of the accountability that is provided by [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=186.52s)]
*  having opposition voices within the structure of an agency. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=191.68s)]
*  Being a minority commissioner, I can't change the direction of the agency. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=195.56s)]
*  I can't interfere with what Chairman Ferguson wants to do or President Trump wants his team [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=199.12s)]
*  to do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=205.52s)]
*  But I can provide transparency and accountability around those decisions. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=206.52s)]
*  And that is extraordinarily important for the American people. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=210.76s)]
*  Rebecca, who appointed you? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=215.08s)]
*  Actually, President Trump appointed me. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  When did that happen? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  Almost exactly seven years ago. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=219.36s)]
*  OK, and then you were reappointed by President Biden. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=221.28s)]
*  Yes, and both times I was confirmed unanimously by the Senate. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  Because we love basics and even if they lean in a slightly nerdy direction on the show, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  and that's my inclination, talk to my audience about what the FTC does and how this commissioner [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=231.72000000000003s)]
*  structure works. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=236.28s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=237.28s)]
*  So you should think of the FTC as the watchdog to prevent billionaire businesses and the [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=238.28s)]
*  who run them from running wild at the expense of the American people. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=243.6s)]
*  Specifically, our job is to stop businesses from lying and cheating. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  What does that mean in practice? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  I'll give you a few examples. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  Last year, the FTC returned $337 million back into the pockets of Americans who's had it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=255.76s)]
*  wrongfully taken from them in frauds and scams. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=262.68s)]
*  We blocked a mega merger of two giant grocery stores that would have raised your food prices [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=266.08s)]
*  even higher. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=270.68s)]
*  We're currently suing pharmacy middlemen over the high price of drugs like insulin. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=272.0s)]
*  We've passed rules to prevent junk fees and to make it easy, as easy to cancel a subscription [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=276.8s)]
*  as it is to sign up for one. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=282.16s)]
*  Something that I know a lot of Americans really care about. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=284.4s)]
*  I can sympathize with that. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=286.68s)]
*  Yeah, we're the cops on the beat for kids' privacy and on and on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=287.68s)]
*  We do competition and consumer protection. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=291.3s)]
*  But at the end of the day, our work is about protecting American consumers, workers and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=293.28s)]
*  honest businesses from illegal practices that make goods more expensive, limit economic [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=298.38s)]
*  opportunity and make it harder to get ahead in today's economy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=303.78s)]
*  And how does the composition of the commission reflect presidential elections? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=307.21999999999997s)]
*  So by statute, the commission has five members who serve staggered terms. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=310.42s)]
*  The statute says that no more than three members can be from the same party. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=315.76s)]
*  By tradition, the commission has structured itself to allow the three majority members [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=321.1s)]
*  to be from the party of the president. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=326.14s)]
*  So for example, Chair Kahn, who was the chair under President Biden, stepped down in January, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=327.82s)]
*  even though she didn't have to, in order to turn leadership over to the Republicans as [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=333.54s)]
*  a result of the election. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=338.58s)]
*  Question, real basic question. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=340.26s)]
*  This firing, yours and the other commissioner appointed Democrat, are going to challenge [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=343.5s)]
*  this legally. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=349.06s)]
*  Functionally, today, does the FTC have a quorum to take any action? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=350.62s)]
*  Well, it's actually not that easy a question. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=356.3s)]
*  There have been times in the past— [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=359.7s)]
*  Easy question, hard answer. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=360.7s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=361.98s)]
*  And there have been times in the past where the FTC only had two sitting commissioners [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=362.98s)]
*  because of resignations of other commissioners, and two commissioners can lawfully act. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=367.1s)]
*  However, Commissioner Bedoy and I contend we are still lawfully commissioners, and so [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=371.7s)]
*  any action taken by two out of four commissioners would not constitute a quorum. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=376.82s)]
*  So there's going to be a lot of uncertainty. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  So if the FTC does engage in action, and someone who is subject to that action wants [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=383.52s)]
*  to sue, this would be—which does happen, even under normal circumstances— [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=389.56s)]
*  It happens all the time, yes. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=393.78s)]
*  This could be a particularly potent legal claim, or at least theoretically one. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=396.4s)]
*  I think it certainly could complicate really important work that the FTC is doing that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=401.47999999999996s)]
*  could have bipartisan support. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=406.15999999999997s)]
*  The last thing that I voted on before the removal was a 4-0 challenge to a merger involving [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=408.14s)]
*  medical device manufacturers that would raise the cost of healthcare even further. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=414.28s)]
*  So there's lots of opportunity for bipartisan agreement on these really important issues, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=419.62s)]
*  and this action really disrupts the opportunity for forward progress about that. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=424.64s)]
*  And I'm glad you mentioned this idea of consensus, because some of the audience might assume, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=430.15999999999997s)]
*  well, Democratic appointees and Republican appointees are always just at each other's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=433.58s)]
*  throat and nothing ever happens, and it's always just a big hash. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=437.82s)]
*  You actually do work things out. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=441.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's not been my experience at the FTC at all. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=443.62s)]
*  As you mentioned, I was originally appointed by President Trump, so I served as a minority [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=446.14s)]
*  commissioner, a majority commissioner, minority commissioner again. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=449.9s)]
*  And over the time I've been at the FTC, the vast majority of things have been unanimous. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=453.76s)]
*  And where there have been disagreements, frequently we're able to work through those disagreements [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=458.86s)]
*  and come to a form of consensus. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=462.68s)]
*  And even where we can't agree, having to engage the viewpoint from someone who disagrees with [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=465.34s)]
*  you makes the work better. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  I think that's part of why Congress in its wisdom designed the FTC and many other government [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=472.32s)]
*  structures intentionally to have this bipartisan composition. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=477.86s)]
*  One of the things Congress created is the Federal Reserve, which is kind of like this. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=482.28s)]
*  And so if there's power to fire you without cause, there might be power to overtake the [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=485.96s)]
*  Federal Reserve. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, the quote you read from Chairman Ferguson says the president can fire anyone he wants, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=491.54s)]
*  anywhere in the government. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=497.28000000000003s)]
*  And that means if the law that protects me from removal is unconstitutional, the law [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=499.54s)]
*  that would protect the chairman of the Federal Reserve from removal is unconstitutional. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=506.62s)]
*  And I think it's really important to get back to the fact that this is not actually about [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=510.98s)]
*  me and my job. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=513.94s)]
*  This is about what does it mean for the American people? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  What does it mean for markets and market stability and market participants? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=518.84s)]
*  And that's where I think the focus really needs to be. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=523.12s)]
*  Because market participants, market signals vector off of rules applied and rules understood. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=526.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and rules engaged with without fear or favor. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=534.44s)]
*  Government needs to operate without fear or favor across the board. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=538.6s)]
*  And the threat of removal, because the president doesn't like you, means that you are operating [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=542.6s)]
*  not just me, but the Republicans at the FTC now are operating under the fear that they [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=547.6999999999999s)]
*  will be removed for refusing to do a favor for some of the president's billionaire friends. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=552.42s)]
*  And that is concerning, whether it's at the FTC or at the Fed or at the SEC or anywhere [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=558.7199999999999s)]
*  else in government, because what we want from our economy, both as consumers, as workers, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=564.74s)]
*  as honest businesses, is stability, predictability and fairness at the end of the day. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=569.66s)]
*  Have you filed anything legally? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=575.9399999999999s)]
*  Not yet, but we will. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=577.8s)]
*  And why has it taken some time? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=579.54s)]
*  Well, I think I didn't plan to get fired. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=582.18s)]
*  The law is very clear. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=586.02s)]
*  And so I think we need to make sure that we are lined up with the strongest argument. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=587.98s)]
*  But we are not dilly dallying, and I expect to be in court soon. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=596.38s)]
*  Rebecca Slaughter, thank you for coming in. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=600.14s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=601.9399999999999s)]
*  I appreciate it very much. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ahGs4vvVWc&t=602.9399999999999s)]
