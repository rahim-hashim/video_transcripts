# Court declaration says some Venezuelan deportees do not have criminal histories in U.S.
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo)
*  President Trump was asked in the Oval Office Friday how he could guarantee that everyone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=0.0s)]
*  deported to El Salvador is a dangerous criminal. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=3.96s)]
*  Well, I was told that they went through a very strong vetting process and that that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=6.68s)]
*  will also be continuing in El Salvador. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=11.88s)]
*  And if there's anything like that, we would certainly want to find out. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=16.36s)]
*  But these were these were a bad group. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  This was a bad group and they were in bad areas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=21.76s)]
*  But we will continue that process. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=24.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  We don't want to make that kind of a mistake. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  CBS News, Immigration and Politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=29.4s)]
*  So Camilo, on Thursday, you reported the names of the 238 Venezuelan men sent to El Salvador. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=33.48s)]
*  Look, an ICE agent did say the agency carefully vetted each and every migrant deported to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=38.2s)]
*  El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=43.32s)]
*  But there are family members, there are lawyers for some of these deportees who are arguing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=45.84s)]
*  that. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=49.96s)]
*  What are you learning? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=50.96s)]
*  Well, the reason we published the list, Lindsay, is because the government has not disclosed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=51.96s)]
*  a lot of information to the public or to this federal judge that is overseeing the legality [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=55.96s)]
*  of the administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=61.72s)]
*  And we are trying to investigate every single case to see whether every deportee who was [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=65.52s)]
*  sent to El Salvador has a criminal record or a known gang affiliation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=71.52s)]
*  Of course, the administration's legal premise and argument is that every single one of these [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=75.8s)]
*  is part of Tren de Hragua, the transnational criminal gang that originated in Venezuela's [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=82.02s)]
*  prisons. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=86.82s)]
*  What we have found so far is that some of the men who were sent to El Salvador do have [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=87.82s)]
*  criminal records in the U.S. or in other countries like Chile, Peru and Colombia, which have [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=91.86s)]
*  hosted millions of Venezuelans who have fled the massive economic collapse in that country [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=96.86s)]
*  and the political crisis there. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=102.46s)]
*  But we also know, according to court declarations, that many of the migrants who were sent to [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=103.89999999999999s)]
*  El Salvador do not have criminal records. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=108.82000000000001s)]
*  In fact, we have received documents from relatives and lawyers of some of the deportees that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  confirm by DHS statements and documents that those people indeed do not have criminal records [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=116.98s)]
*  in the U.S. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=125.02000000000001s)]
*  Now, we go to the question of gang affiliation, and that's where it gets really tricky because [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=126.02000000000001s)]
*  the government says it uses intelligence databases and other techniques like looking at social [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=131.18s)]
*  media and tattoos to verify gang affiliations. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=136.98s)]
*  But obviously, lawyers would say that that is a very slippery slope, Lindsay, because [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=140.94s)]
*  tattoos do not necessarily equate to gang membership, and they believe that some of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=145.85999999999999s)]
*  the men were sent there based solely on tattoos. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=150.5s)]
*  You are also learning the Trump administration will revoke the legal status for really hundreds [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=154.66s)]
*  of thousands of Latin American and Haitian migrants. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=160.45999999999998s)]
*  This is a major policy announcement by the Trump administration, which we previewed back [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=161.45999999999998s)]
*  in early February. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  The administration has just announced that it will revoke the legal status of hundreds [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=167.34s)]
*  of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who were allowed [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=171.74s)]
*  to come into the U.S. lawfully under the Biden administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=177.34s)]
*  This is a program known as CHNV that was set up by President Biden to reduce illegal immigration [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=181.4s)]
*  at the U.S.-Mexico border by offering would-be migrants a legal way to enter the U.S. so they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=188.06s)]
*  wouldn't have to use a smuggler and cross into the country illegally. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=193.73999999999998s)]
*  More than half a million people came under that process, and now the Department of Homeland [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=198.14s)]
*  Security in the next 30 days will be terminating their parole, and it is now warning them that [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  if they do not voluntarily leave the country self-deport, they will face immediate arrests [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  and deportation by ICE. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  Do you expect there will be legal challenges? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  Yes, almost certainly, yes. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=217.01999999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration resuming migrant flights to Guantanamo Bay, the naval base [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=219.86s)]
*  in Cuba, what should we know? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=223.34s)]
*  Last week, the administration emptied out the migrant holding facilities at Guantanamo [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=225.5s)]
*  Bay, Cuba for unknown reasons. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=231.0s)]
*  We did not know at the time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=233.60000000000002s)]
*  Now we know that those flights have resumed. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=235.10000000000002s)]
*  In fact, two U.S. officials tell us that there was one flight yesterday with about 21 migrant [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=237.22000000000003s)]
*  detainees on board. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=243.10000000000002s)]
*  We do not know their nationalities, but they will be held there until their home countries [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=244.68s)]
*  rather can accept their deportation, and we understand that more flights are supposed [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=249.58s)]
*  to happen in the next few days and in the coming weeks as well. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  Camila Montoya-Galvez, thank you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEnKxknxJEo&t=257.86s)]
