# Las Vegas police arrest man in connection with Tesla arson attack
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8)
*  The man accused of setting Teslas on fire at a collision center in Las Vegas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=0.0s)]
*  appears in court at this hour. Officers arrested 36-year-old Paul Kim on charges [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=4.44s)]
*  including arson and possession of an explosive device. So let's go to our [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=9.52s)]
*  breaking news correspondent, Chanel Call, in the CBS Newsroom in New York. Chanel, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  what do we know about the suspect who's in court right now? Well, he was meant to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=17.52s)]
*  be in court, but we're hearing now that he has been taken into federal custody, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=21.64s)]
*  meaning that he will not make that court appearance. Again, we're talking about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=26.04s)]
*  36-year-old Paul Kim. He was arrested on Wednesday in connection with that attack [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=29.28s)]
*  at a Tesla collision center in Las Vegas, facing a total of 15 state charges, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  including arson, destroying property, and possessing an explosive device. Take a [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=39.72s)]
*  listen to how police described the attack. I'll let this video play because [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  you'll get a better shot of the suspect. You can see his description as he goes [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=49.44s)]
*  across the clear doors there committing his act of crime. Once he finishes spray [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=53.48s)]
*  painting the words resist on the doors, he then approaches multiple Tesla [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=65.8s)]
*  vehicles that were parked in the front of the center. He proceeded to shoot into [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=69.52s)]
*  each vehicle and used a molotov cocktail to set the vehicles on fire. We'll play a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=73.84s)]
*  few video clips here to kind of show you his behavior. You can see him right there [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  in the dark clothing. He casually walks over to his first vehicle that's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=81.08s)]
*  targeted. He will soon put down his backpack onto the ground, and then he [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=84.36s)]
*  transitions to the firearm, and you'll see him shoot into the vehicle. Once he [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=91.16s)]
*  shoots into the vehicle, he ends up going back from the vehicle to the bag, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=101.84s)]
*  and then back to the car, presumably picking up his item that he used to be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=106.0s)]
*  able to fire bomb the vehicle. We believe that was a molotov cocktail, and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=109.8s)]
*  you'll see in a moment here the vehicle will ignite and ultimately fully engulf [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=113.52s)]
*  causing severe damage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=118.08s)]
*  The suspect then continues onto a second vehicle, and you can see here he's onto [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  the second target. He'll do very similar behavior where he shoots into the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=128.04s)]
*  vehicle. He goes into the backpack, retrieves an item, and ultimately you'll [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=131.56s)]
*  notice here that he ends up getting the second vehicle on fire as well. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  From there, he then proceeds to his third vehicle, repeats the same type of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=139.8s)]
*  activity. One of the incendiary devices he was not able to ignite, which is one [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=156.24s)]
*  of the devices that we were able to recover, but ultimately five vehicles [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=161.0s)]
*  were damaged, to include three of which were fully destroyed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=164.56s)]
*  And so at this point, police have not Jules outlined a specific or clear [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=170.72s)]
*  motive, but they do say that they found that he was connected on social media [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=177.0s)]
*  with the Communist Party USA group and some pro Palestine groups. Also want to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=181.48000000000002s)]
*  mention that the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is also part of this [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  investigation. They were at that news conference earlier today, and now we can [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  confirm that federal authorities have taken Paul Kim into custody. So on top [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=196.48s)]
*  of those state charges that I mentioned, he will also be facing some federal [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=200.56s)]
*  charges. Last we heard likely that will be federal arson and possession of a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  destructive device. Chanel call Chanel. Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P6ovhOLZw8&t=208.44s)]
