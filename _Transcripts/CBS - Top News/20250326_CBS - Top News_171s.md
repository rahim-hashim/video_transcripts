# Supreme Court rules on ghost guns case
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg)
*  All right, we've got this breaking news just coming into our newsroom right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=0.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court has issued a ruling on ghost guns. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=5.12s)]
*  Let's cross over to our CBS News legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, who has all of the latest. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  Jan, great to see you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=13.56s)]
*  What's the update? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=14.84s)]
*  Well, Errol, I mean, obviously this is one of the biggest decisions of the term that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=15.84s)]
*  we've been waiting on, and it's about, as you said, ghost guns. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=19.12s)]
*  Well, what are ghost guns? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=21.84s)]
*  Those are those unregulated, do-it-yourself guns that people can buy on the Internet and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=23.12s)]
*  put the pieces together, they're unassembled, and turn it into a gun. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=28.28s)]
*  There are no background checks for these kind of weapons. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=32.44s)]
*  You can lie about your age. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=34.52s)]
*  If you're 16 or a criminal, you can get one. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=35.82s)]
*  There are no serial numbers. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=38.44s)]
*  And so as a result of this, the Biden administration decided to regulate them under an old gun [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=40.0s)]
*  control law. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=46.16s)]
*  Some of the firearms manufacturers said that that exceeded their authority. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=48.16s)]
*  And this is now what the Supreme Court decided today, ruling with the Biden administration [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=52.32s)]
*  and now the Trump administration has entered this case, ruling that the ATF does have that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=57.24s)]
*  authority to regulate these ghost guns, that if you're going to sell a gun like this, you've [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=62.2s)]
*  got to do a background check. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=67.48s)]
*  You've got to put a serial number on it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=69.28s)]
*  And this is important because police and we've talked to many of them have seen an explosion [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=71.08s)]
*  of these kind of guns, more than a thousand percent increase over the past five years [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=76.64s)]
*  that they've recovered at gun scenes, I mean, at crime scenes. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=81.0s)]
*  So this is a significant case. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=84.28s)]
*  Gun control advocates very closely watching it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=86.6s)]
*  But the court is allowing the ATF to go ahead and regulate these kind of ghost guns, as [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=89.38s)]
*  you said, as firearms. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=96.0s)]
*  So bottom line, Errol, if it looks like a gun, it fires like a gun, it acts like a gun, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=97.74s)]
*  they're going to treat it like a gun. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=104.0s)]
*  And you've got to get those serial numbers on it to sell it and background checks as [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=105.84s)]
*  well. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=109.96s)]
*  Jan, that's a significant update, especially as you note that many police departments across [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  the country were advocating for some type of regulation because these weapons in the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=115.6s)]
*  hands of so many people were putting their lives at risk. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  With this decision now, when do we start to see these regulations, limitations go into [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=124.91999999999999s)]
*  place? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=131.68s)]
*  What would the timeline be? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=132.68s)]
*  So that's the issue here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=133.68s)]
*  The lower courts said that the ATF had exceeded their authority and they couldn't regulate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=135.36s)]
*  these ghost guns, couldn't require the serial numbers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  The Supreme Court already had stepped in and put those rulings on hold. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=143.4s)]
*  So this already has been taking place. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=148.02s)]
*  This decision today really kind of preserves the status quo. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, had the decision gone the other way, and by the way, it was seven to two written [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=153.28000000000003s)]
*  by Justice Gorsuch that we could have regulations, it would have been a much bigger deal. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=158.32000000000002s)]
*  But nonetheless, this is very important gun control measure, Errol. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=162.92s)]
*  Alright, Jan Crawford live for us in our DC Bureau with that very important update. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=166.55999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Jan. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUUac4bBpXg&t=170.44s)]
