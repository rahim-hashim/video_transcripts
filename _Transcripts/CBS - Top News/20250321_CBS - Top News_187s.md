# What to know about closure of London's Heathrow Airport due to power outage
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE)
*  If you are scheduled to travel in and out of Heathrow Airport in London today, you are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=0.0s)]
*  out of luck. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=3.84s)]
*  The airport says it will remain closed all day because of a fire at a nearby electrical [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=4.84s)]
*  substation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=8.88s)]
*  Fire is now under control, but it did knock out power to thousands of homes and businesses, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=9.88s)]
*  and it is causing some major travel disruptions. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News correspondent Ian Lee, who's following this for us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=16.2s)]
*  So Ian, I know it's still early in the investigation, but any word on what caused the fire? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=20.8s)]
*  The reporters are looking into that and they want to get answers quickly, Vlad. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=29.2s)]
*  So they brought in the counterterrorism command, not because they believe there's been foul [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  play, but they have the specialists, the resources and the capabilities to quickly pinpoint the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=37.0s)]
*  cause of the fire and to limit any further disruption. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  But right now, getting that airport up and running again, finding out the cause of the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=46.72s)]
*  fire, those are the two main things they're trying to do. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=50.04s)]
*  How does Heathrow's closure impact other travelers around the world, Ian? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=54.8s)]
*  Yeah, Vlad, hundreds of thousands of people travel through Heathrow on a daily basis, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  about 1300 flights it operates. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=65.88s)]
*  And so there is a lot of disruption, as you can imagine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=69.28s)]
*  120 planes had to turn back. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=72.64s)]
*  One passenger described what the pilot told them. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=76.44s)]
*  We went three hours over and three hours back. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=80.32s)]
*  So the flight was the same amount of time. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=82.96s)]
*  I just didn't end up where I wanted to be. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=84.88s)]
*  Left on time, everything was good. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=87.36s)]
*  I was sleeping and the pilot came on and said that some of us may have noticed the plane [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=90.28s)]
*  was turning around and not to be alarmed, but the London Heathrow was closed due to a fire. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=95.08s)]
*  500 flights to and from the United States have been affected. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=104.96s)]
*  And again, authorities are hoping that they can get it open as quickly as possible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=109.84s)]
*  And so, yeah, I mean, the question, of course, Ian, is that flights not just in Britain [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=116.36s)]
*  or even in Europe, but even the United States and around the world are being affected by [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=121.52s)]
*  this airport closure. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=125.96s)]
*  Have you had any reporting on frustrated passengers or even folks from Heathrow Airport with a statement? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=128.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, Heathrow is, you know, staying on top of this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  We're hearing that they have two out of the four terminals have electricity. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=142.88s)]
*  Officials are saying that they hope that the airport will be open again tomorrow. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=146.92s)]
*  They are staying on top of this. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=151.84s)]
*  Passengers clearly frustrated. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=154.28s)]
*  You know, this isn't something that you expect. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=156.56s)]
*  I was speaking with one person who said they dropped off a family at the airport at three [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=158.76s)]
*  in the morning today and that they quickly realized the airport airport wasn't open. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=163.72s)]
*  And so, you know, the frustration, we say 200,000 people fly in and out of Heathrow, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=169.68s)]
*  roughly that many on a daily basis. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  That is that many individual stories of frustration today, Vlad. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=177.68s)]
*  All right, Ian Lee reporting from Heathrow Airport this morning for us. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=183.4s)]
*  Thank you so much, Ian. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydBRxLtWpjE&t=186.44s)]
