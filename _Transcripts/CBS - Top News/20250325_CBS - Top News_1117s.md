# Latest details on Trump officials' group chat with journalist about Yemen bombing
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4)
*  Tempers flaring intentions hitting a boiling point at a Senate intelligence hearing today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=0.0s)]
*  Our country's top intelligence leaders were in the hot seat being grilled in the fallout from that [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=5.44s)]
*  explosive article by the Atlantic. It accused the Trump administration of adding the publication's [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=10.88s)]
*  editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a group chat on the Signal app discussing a highly sensitive [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=16.64s)]
*  bomb operation in Yemen. That article is now raising major concerns about national security [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=24.08s)]
*  and senators are demanding answers. Senator Michael Bennett had a very heated exchange [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=30.32s)]
*  with CIA director John Ratcliffe. Let's play back some of that. Did you know that the president's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=35.36s)]
*  Middle East advisor was in Moscow on this thread while you were as director of the CIA participating [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  in this thread? Were you aware of that? Are you aware of that today? I'm not aware of that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=53.44s)]
*  This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=60.0s)]
*  and the personnel who work for them is entirely unacceptable. It's an embarrassment. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=67.36s)]
*  Senator, you need to do better. Now defense officials claim that the group chat app had [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=75.12s)]
*  no classified information about the military strikes on Houthi rebels. Now that chat included [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=81.44s)]
*  a total of 18 people. Goldberg said some of the names in the group appeared to be Vice President [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=86.8s)]
*  JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the director of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=92.24s)]
*  national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Now in that thread, Secretary Hegseth shared operational [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=98.56s)]
*  details about the strike including the timing, the targets, and the types of weapons used. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=104.72s)]
*  After the strikes, the group exchanged emojis or actually the text exchange, they exchanged emojis [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=110.96s)]
*  including flames, fist bumps, and American flags. Now the National Security Council issued a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=117.36s)]
*  statement saying that the messages seem to be authentic and they will review how Goldberg was [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=122.32s)]
*  added to that text chain. Now today senators repeatedly pressed Tulsi Gabbard to release [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=127.6s)]
*  those messages. Let's listen to this exchange with Virginia Senator Mark Warner. Director Gabbard, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=132.64s)]
*  did you participate in the group chat with Secretary of Defense and other [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=139.44s)]
*  Trump senior officials discussing the Yemen war plans? Senator, I don't want to get into this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=142.96s)]
*  Ma'am, were you on? You're not going to be willing to address. So you're not, are you denying? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  Matt, will you answer my question ma'am? You are not TG on this group chat. I'm not going to get [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=153.44s)]
*  into the specifics. Do you refuse to acknowledge whether you are on this group chat? Senator, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to get into this. Why are you going to get into the specifics? Is this [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=165.76s)]
*  is it because it's all classified? Because this is currently under review by the National Security [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=169.44s)]
*  Council. Because it's all classified? If it's not classified, share the text now. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  Now Democrats spent the morning voicing their concerns. Just take a listen to some of their [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=179.6s)]
*  remarks. Every single senator, Democrat and Republican and independent, must demand [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=183.6s)]
*  accountability. I am calling for a bipartisan investigation in the Senate of this mishandling. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=191.2s)]
*  I am also calling for the Defense IG to fully investigate. This is too serious not to know [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  exactly what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from ever happening again. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=208.72s)]
*  Instead of accepting responsibility outrageously, Secretary Hegseth attacked the journalist and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  called him deceitful. He took the deny till you die approach. Even though these messages were [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=220.8s)]
*  already authenticated by the National Security Council spokesperson, Secretary Hegseth's refusal [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=229.68s)]
*  to accept responsibility yesterday was eerily similar to the way he conducted himself during [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=236.56s)]
*  the confirmation process. I fear how he will react to future moments. Now across the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  aisle, Republicans are looking to write this whole thing off as a mistake. House Speaker Johnson [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=250.72s)]
*  seemed to downplay the possibility of anybody getting fired over this leak. Take a listen. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=255.6s)]
*  They've acknowledged that there was an error and they're correcting it. And I would have asked the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=261.2s)]
*  same thing of the Biden administration. I don't think anyone should have lost their job over that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=265.12s)]
*  because an errant number, you know, found its way onto a dialogue between leaders. It's a mistake, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=269.2s)]
*  but we got to correct it going forward and they will. CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=275.76s)]
*  Killian joins us now from Capitol Hill with more on this. Nicole, great to be with you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=280.4s)]
*  That intelligence hearing started back up soon behind closed doors. It's set to start back up. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=284.88s)]
*  It hasn't if it hasn't already. What has stood out to you so far? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, obviously many lawmakers, as is the case with a lot of these hearings, still want answers. I [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=295.2s)]
*  mean, you heard Senator Mark Warner there demand to Tulsi Gabbard, you know, then show me the text. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=300.88s)]
*  And obviously there was a lot of back and forth about whether or not that information on the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  text chain was classified or not. At one point, Tulsi Gabbard said that she was going to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=309.36s)]
*  defer to the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. But she got a response back from main Senator Angus [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=314.64s)]
*  King, who said, yeah, but you're the director of national intelligence. In essence, you should know [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=322.48s)]
*  what's classified or not. So there were a lot of pointed exchanges there. You know, what this means [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=326.72s)]
*  as far as next steps remains to be seen. There are obviously calls among some congressional [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=333.36s)]
*  Democrats to launch an investigation into this. Many congressional Republicans seem more reticent. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=338.56s)]
*  And as you mentioned earlier, are kind of writing this off as just an errant mistake. But when it is [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=344.48s)]
*  a matter involving national security, many lawmakers don't necessarily see it that way and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=349.92s)]
*  think it should be taken more seriously. We know that Atlantic article is the talk of Washington [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=355.6s)]
*  today, and it's expected to come up in other hearings happening on the Hill. What more can [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  you tell us about those? Yeah, well, obviously there will be a similar hearing in the House [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=365.04s)]
*  tomorrow with Intel officials. So I doubt this issue is going to die down anytime soon as House [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=372.0s)]
*  lawmakers also kind of get a crack at asking these top intelligence officials more information about [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  what exactly happened here and what went wrong. But that being said, again, you know, the pressure [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  continues to mount for some type of more deeper probe or investigation. But again, you have a lot [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=391.36s)]
*  of Republicans who right now are in control of both chambers kind of pushing back against that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=397.52000000000004s)]
*  They feel for the most part that, you know, this was a mistake. Let's try to make sure it doesn't [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=403.04s)]
*  happen again. I would note there are also or have been some calls for the national security advisor, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=408.8s)]
*  Mike Walz, who former member of Congress for him to step down. Many Republicans for now seem to [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=415.04s)]
*  have Walz's back as far as that is concerned. You know, the Speaker Johnson made clear he does not [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  think that he should resign or step down, but it'll be interesting to see in light of these [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=426.88s)]
*  hearings if pressure grows against Walz to take some type of action. Certainly that is something [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=430.96000000000004s)]
*  we continue to watch for potentially also as the administration tries to contain the fallout from [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  this incident. All right, Nicole Killian live for us on Capitol Hill. Thank you so much, Nicole. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=444.64s)]
*  National security correspondent Charlie Daggett. Charlie, we've seen some tough questioning on [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=451.2s)]
*  Capitol Hill today by members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. I'm curious, what are [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=456.4s)]
*  your thoughts on what you've seen so far this morning? Yeah, you know what? It was a grilling [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=460.72s)]
*  and I think we could have expected a grilling because this is the most major security breach [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=466.0s)]
*  in a generation or more. We have to be honest with that. You know, this is a breach, an intel [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=471.2s)]
*  breach that potentially put service members' lives in danger and I think we have to pick it apart at [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=477.03999999999996s)]
*  those levels, okay, because that's the first thing and that was urgent. Never before have certainly [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=483.92s)]
*  in my experience have I ever seen something on a channel-like signal being broadcast, if you will, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=488.64s)]
*  or being shared in real time as a conflict was underway. You know, we use signal here. I use it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=496.8s)]
*  with my contacts here at the Pentagon. It's commonly used among service members. It's even [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  used in the field, but I asked everybody, I said, in any scenario would you have that? They said, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=507.52000000000004s)]
*  absolutely not. I mean, it's very black and white. There are laws against it and of course, when it [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=512.8s)]
*  comes to force protection, that is the ultimate concern here. So away from national security, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=517.84s)]
*  which will be a problem in the days ahead because if that information, sort of American military [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=522.96s)]
*  tactics in the middle of a conflict were to fall into the wrong hands, that is a national security [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=529.6s)]
*  issue. There will also be issues if this investigation, if there is to be an investigation [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=534.48s)]
*  about the legalities of what has gone on. You know, so in this building and in the White House [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  situation room, right, it's called a skiff and I had to actually remind myself what skiff meant. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=545.92s)]
*  Sensitive, compartmented information facility. Okay, they're very strict. There are certain rooms, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=552.8s)]
*  almost all of them, I can't go into with my phones. It's just not allowed. Also, you're not [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=559.36s)]
*  allowed to take a phone in there or take a phone out of there, okay? These are closed environments [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=565.28s)]
*  because of the conversations that take place and there are systems in place for these classified [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=571.84s)]
*  conversations to take place. They've been unwieldy. You have to use different phones, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=577.12s)]
*  different equipment, different systems, but they are in place so that you don't have to use something [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=581.6800000000001s)]
*  like Signal. But my takeaway from what I was hearing at that hearing today or grilling today [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  is as it went on, it seemed that both the individuals there, Tulsi Gabbard and, sorry, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=594.1600000000001s)]
*  name escapes me, were both starting to lead toward the defense secretary. I heard Nicole Killian [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=601.12s)]
*  saying just now that there's a debate over whether the information that was inside that chat was [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=608.4s)]
*  classified or not. And the senators were arguing, if it is not classified, just share it with us. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=615.6s)]
*  Or maybe the reporter can share it with us. Would you give him the okay to share it with us? Neither [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  individual was happy about doing that. And then they started saying, well, the classified element [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=626.96s)]
*  of that information actually came from the secretary of defense. SecDef is in Hawaii right now. He's on [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=631.12s)]
*  a trip to Indo-Pacom on a tour. In fact, one of my colleagues is with him. So he's been relatively [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=637.52s)]
*  quiet aside from berating the original source of the journalism and trying to undermine the quality [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  of that journalism. So I think once we start drilling down into what was said and what they're [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=651.68s)]
*  comfortable in releasing, especially when it comes to target acquisition and sequencing, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=659.52s)]
*  those are both very critical things, we'll get a clearer idea of who's culpable. And, Charlie, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=663.5999999999999s)]
*  you brought up a really important point there earlier. You talked about the legality of all [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=670.8s)]
*  of this, how these details could be a violation of laws. Are we talking about the espionage [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=676.64s)]
*  laws? And in which case, that's very serious if you violate those. Yes, it's the espionage [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=682.64s)]
*  act or the espionage law and also the records act. And they are kind of in tandem. So it's important [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=690.56s)]
*  to note that both of those laws or neither of those laws have to do necessarily with malice. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=697.28s)]
*  It's taking classified information and sharing it in an unclassified way or even unwittingly [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=702.5600000000001s)]
*  to people that haven't got the classification qualifications, if you want to put it that way. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=709.12s)]
*  So there doesn't need to be shown. When you think of espionage, obviously it sounds like spying, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=714.24s)]
*  right? You're getting information and you're giving it to the wrong folks. It also includes [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=718.88s)]
*  accessing information. And this is where I go back to the skiff. There are certain individuals [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=724.16s)]
*  who have access to that kind of classified information. And if they take that information, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=729.28s)]
*  which is classified and should not leave the room except to other qualified members on qualified [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=734.16s)]
*  systems, and that gets disseminated, let alone the whole fact that it went to a journalist, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=740.0s)]
*  the fact that they were having the conversation at all on signal will call into question certain [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=745.36s)]
*  legal ramifications. Now, who is going to launch those legal proceedings? That's a whole other [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=751.68s)]
*  question. Is it going to be the Department of Justice these days? It's hard to tell. Is the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=757.68s)]
*  Senate going to push for it? I don't know what kind of levers of power that they have, but it's been [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=762.16s)]
*  said to me, you know, and I walk around these halls, I said, really signal? And there's a sense [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=768.0s)]
*  of bewilderment because if there was just an intelligence officer, if there was a soldier or [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=772.3199999999999s)]
*  sailor that had shared this sort of information, they wouldn't have a job today. We'll have to see [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=777.3599999999999s)]
*  what the fallout from all of this is as it continues. Charlie Dagata, thank you so much [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=783.6s)]
*  for joining us. Always great to see you. A new statement from the White House on the controversy [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=787.6s)]
*  surrounding the Atlantic article that we've been reporting on. What are you hearing there from the [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=791.76s)]
*  White House? Yeah, the fallout continuing over that signal group chat fiasco. The White House [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=795.76s)]
*  put out a statement a short bit ago suggesting that the recent news around the Atlantic signal [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=801.9200000000001s)]
*  reporting is a coordinated effort to distract from the successful actions taken by President [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=808.24s)]
*  Trump and his administration to make America's enemies pay and keep Americans safe. They also [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=814.4s)]
*  pointed out that the Biden administration removed the Houthi rebels as a designated terrorist [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=819.76s)]
*  organization and that Trump on his first day in office re designated them as a terrorist [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=825.12s)]
*  organization. So trying to compare themselves to the previous administration and the way they [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=830.24s)]
*  handled these rebels, trying to take that spin rather than recognize the breach of security [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=834.72s)]
*  that this was, including the editor in chief of the Atlantic magazine on very sensitive [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=842.64s)]
*  conversations happening in the signal group chat with top administration officials. We also heard [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=848.72s)]
*  from Caroline Love at the White House press secretary this morning in a post on X where she [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=853.9200000000001s)]
*  said that no war plans were discussed, no classified materials were sent on the thread, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=858.88s)]
*  and the White House counsel's office has provided additional guidance on the platforms that top [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=863.76s)]
*  administration officials should be using when having any sort of conversation. And we can report [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=869.28s)]
*  that signal is among some of the top communications platforms used with top Trump administration [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=876.16s)]
*  officials. It's very popular. A lot of them like to conduct their conversations using signal, but [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=882.8s)]
*  we do know now that is something that is under review, under consideration of whether or not they [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=888.16s)]
*  should continue to be using this commercial platform to be discussing not only sensitive [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=893.12s)]
*  information like war plans, but also just day to day communications that they're having with each [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=898.72s)]
*  other, with people outside of the administration, with reporters, people all over Washington. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=903.84s)]
*  All right. Yeah, we're going to be hearing more about this. Have a feeling. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=908.8s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi, thank you so much. I heat it. Senate intelligence hearing top cabinet officials [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=911.2s)]
*  facing tough questions after the Atlantic published an article detailing how their editor in chief [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=916.72s)]
*  was added to a group chat with top cabinet defense officials discussing a U.S. strike in Yemen. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=922.72s)]
*  CBS North News correspondent Chanel Call has been following this all day for us in our newsroom. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=929.76s)]
*  Chanel, what can you unpack from the hearing so far? Well, so much to unpack for you, Liz. The [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=934.8000000000001s)]
*  public portion we should mention of that Senate Intelligence Committee hearing has now wrapped up, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=940.72s)]
*  so the committee now moving to a closed session. That of course means we don't have the luxury or [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=945.6s)]
*  privilege to listen into those conversations, but before that recess this afternoon, there were a [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=950.88s)]
*  lot of really heated, really fiery moments, including this one where Democratic Senator [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=955.84s)]
*  Mark Kelly really pressed the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=960.96s)]
*  on what was discussed in that signal group chat. In the signal chain that we have been talking about, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=965.04s)]
*  was there any mention of a target in Yemen? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=972.08s)]
*  I don't remember mention of specific targets. Any generic target? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=981.6s)]
*  I believe there was discussion around targets in general. Mr. Brackliff? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=992.88s)]
*  I think that's consistent with my recollection. Again, I don't have access to that. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1001.76s)]
*  And also today, Liz, both Gabbard and CIA Director John Brackliff were asked whether the information [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1006.64s)]
*  in that text thread was classified. Both of them repeatedly said it was not. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  Democratic Senator John Ossoff also grilled Brackliff about this. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1016.64s)]
*  Director Brackliff, this was a huge mistake, correct? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1021.6s)]
*  No. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1029.44s)]
*  A national... hold on. No, no, you hold on. No, no, Director Brackliff. I asked you a yes or no question and now you hold on. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1030.24s)]
*  A national political reporter was made privy to sensitive information about imminent military operations against a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1036.24s)]
*  You can characterize it how you want. The White House has made clear that it was a very important mistake, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1048.24s)]
*  an inadvertent mistake of adding a reporter to a seal. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1054.24s)]
*  Well, I think that they characterized it as a mistake. This is an embarrassment. This is utterly unprofessional. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1058.24s)]
*  There's been no apology. There has been no recognition of the gravity of this error. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1064.24s)]
*  And by the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1070.24s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1078.24s)]
*  And Liz, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have really criticized this security breach. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1081.24s)]
*  You heard earlier this hour Charlie Daggett calling this the biggest national security breach in a generation. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1086.24s)]
*  So there are certainly Democrats who are now calling for those officials that were in that group chat to be investigated. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1092.24s)]
*  But when FBI Director Cash Patel was asked about that today, he said, look, I just found out about this whole tax fiasco last night [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1098.24s)]
*  and that he hasn't determined yet whether an investigation will in fact happen. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1106.24s)]
*  Yeah, and laws could have been violated as well. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1110.24s)]
*  All right. CBS News correspondent Chanel Call. Thank you so much for that update, Chanel. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzr47dJu4H4&t=1112.24s)]
