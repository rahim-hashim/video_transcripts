Video Description: Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard addressed the House Intelligence Committee for a hearing on global threats to the U.S. Gabbard alleged that the Signal texting application came pre-installed in government devices issued to members of the Trump administration. This comes as more questions emerge over the group chat among Trump officials about attacking a Houthi target in Yemen. The group chat mistakenly included The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.

**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs)
*  Chairman Yields, I now recognize Director Gabbard to make a statement on behalf of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=0.0s)]
*  intelligence community. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=4.72s)]
*  Thank you very much Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Himes, members of the committee. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=5.72s)]
*  Thank you for the opportunity for us to be here to present the 2025 annual threat assessment. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm joined here by my colleagues from the CIA, DIA, FBI and NSA. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=18.72s)]
*  Our testimony today offers the collective assessment of the 18 U.S. intelligence elements [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=24.12s)]
*  making up the U.S. intelligence community and draws on the intelligence collection and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=29.32s)]
*  information available to the IC from open source and private sector and the expertise [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=34.08s)]
*  of our analysts. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=39.02s)]
*  It evaluates what the IC assesses most threatens our people and our nation's ability to live [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=40.52s)]
*  in a peaceful, free, secure and prosperous society. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=46.36s)]
*  As you know very well, we face an increasingly complex threat environment that is threatening [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=50.94s)]
*  us here at home and our interests abroad. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=56.0s)]
*  I'll begin by focusing on what most immediately and directly threatens the United States and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=59.6s)]
*  the well-being of the American people. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=63.84s)]
*  The non-state criminal groups and terrorists putting American lives and livelihood at [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=66.16s)]
*  risk. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=71.24s)]
*  I'll then move on to focus on the key nation states who have the capability to threaten [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  our security and the interests of the United States. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=76.52s)]
*  Cartels, gangs and other transnational criminal organizations in our part of the world are [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=79.68s)]
*  engaging in a wide array of illicit activity from narcotics trafficking to money laundering, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  smuggling of illegal immigrants and human trafficking, which endanger the health, welfare [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=90.56s)]
*  and safety of everyday Americans. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=95.56s)]
*  Based on our latest reporting available for the year-long period ending October 2024, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=99.0s)]
*  cartels were largely responsible for the deaths of more than 54,000 American citizens due [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=104.4s)]
*  to synthetic opioids. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=110.2s)]
*  Co-based transnational criminal organizations are the main suppliers of illicit fentanyl [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=113.0s)]
*  to the U.S. market and are quickly adapting to enforcement and regulatory pressures by [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=117.2s)]
*  using multiple sources and methods to procure precursor chemicals and equipment primarily [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=123.1s)]
*  from China and India, many of which are dual-use chemicals used in legitimate industries. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=128.76s)]
*  Independent fentanyl producers are also increasingly fragmenting the drug trade in Mexico. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=135.2s)]
*  The ready availability of precursor chemicals and ease of making illicit fentanyl have enabled [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=141.96s)]
*  independent actors to increase illicit fentanyl production and smuggling operations in Mexico. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  Cartels are profiting from human trafficking and have likely facilitated more than 2 million [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=153.56s)]
*  illegal immigrants encountered by law enforcement at the U.S. southwest border in 2024 alone, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=158.32s)]
*  straining our vital resources and putting the American people at risk. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=164.28s)]
*  Criminal groups drive much of the unrest and lawlessness in the Western Hemisphere. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=169.2s)]
*  They also engage in extortion, weapons and human smuggling, and other illicit and dangerous [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=173.88s)]
*  revenue-seeking operations, including kidnapping for ransom, forced labor, and sex trafficking. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=179.56s)]
*  While some of these key drivers of migrants are expected to persist, heightened U.S. border [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=187.39999999999998s)]
*  security enforcement and deportations under the Trump administration are proving to serve [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  as a deterrent for migrants seeking to illegally cross our borders. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=196.04s)]
*  U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border in January 2025 dropped 85% [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=200.04s)]
*  from the same period in 2024. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=207.16s)]
*  Transnational Islamist extremists such as ISIS and al-Qaeda and affiliated jihadi groups [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=210.6s)]
*  continue to pursue, enable, or inspire attacks against the United States and our citizens [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=215.48s)]
*  abroad and within the homeland to advance their ultimate objective of establishing a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=221.2s)]
*  global Islamist caliphate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=227.72s)]
*  This includes heightened efforts to spread their ideology to recruit and radicalize individuals [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=230.95999999999998s)]
*  in the U.S. and the West. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=235.32s)]
*  While the New Year's Day attacker in New Orleans had no known direct contact with ISIS terrorists, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=238.04s)]
*  he was influenced and radicalized by ISIS ideological propaganda, as one example. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  Al-Qaeda and its affiliates continue to call for attacks against the United States as they [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=250.16s)]
*  conduct attacks overseas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=255.0s)]
*  These jihadist groups have shown their ability to adapt and evolve, including using new technology [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=258.04s)]
*  and tactics to spread their ideology and recruit new followers. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=264.12s)]
*  A range of non-state cyber criminals are also targeting our economic interests, our critical [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=268.84s)]
*  infrastructure, and advanced commercial capability for extortion, other coercive pursuits, and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=274.28s)]
*  financial gain. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=279.68s)]
*  These actors are using a variety of tactics, including phishing, ransomware, and denial [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=281.8s)]
*  of service attacks to disrupt our systems and steal sensitive and lucrative information, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=285.92s)]
*  using available technologies and taking advantage of U.S. cyber vulnerabilities. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=291.92s)]
*  Ransomware actors last year, for example, attacked the largest payment processor for [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=297.76s)]
*  U.S. healthcare institutions, and another set of criminal actors conducted cyber attacks [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  against U.S. water utilities. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=307.68s)]
*  Some of these non-state cyber actors also operate as proxies for or emulate similar [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=310.6s)]
*  activities being carried out by major state actors. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=315.24s)]
*  The IC sees China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea engaging in activities that could challenge [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=319.48s)]
*  U.S. capabilities and interests, especially related to our security and economy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=324.8s)]
*  They are in some cases working together in different areas to target U.S. interests and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  protect themselves from U.S. sanctions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=334.52s)]
*  At this point, the IC assesses that China is our most capable strategic competitor. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=337.76s)]
*  Under the leadership of Xi Jinping, the People's Republic of China seeks to position itself [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=342.92s)]
*  as a leading power in the world stage, economically, technologically, and militarily. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=346.96s)]
*  Beijing is driven in part by a belief that Washington is pursuing a broad effort to contain [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=352.88s)]
*  China's rise and undermine CCP rule. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=357.44s)]
*  China's most serious domestic challenge is probably China's slowing economy and the potential [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=362.04s)]
*  instability that could occur if socioeconomic grievances lead to large-scale unrest. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=366.16s)]
*  Growing economic tensions with the United States and other countries could also weigh [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=372.12s)]
*  on China's plans for economic growth and domestic job creation. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=375.34000000000003s)]
*  China's military is fielding advanced capabilities, including hypersonic weapons, stealth aircraft, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=380.32000000000005s)]
*  advanced submarines, stronger space and cyber warfare assets, and a larger arsenal of nuclear [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=386.24s)]
*  weapons. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=391.92s)]
*  While it appears they would like to develop and maintain positive ties with the United [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=392.92s)]
*  States and the Trump administration to advance its own interests and avoid conflict, China [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=397.40000000000003s)]
*  is building its military capability in part to gain an advantage in the event of a military [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=402.76s)]
*  conflict with the United States around the issue of China's efforts towards unification [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=407.94s)]

*  sensitive U.S. government and private sector information and pre-positioning additional [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=421.82s)]
*  asymmetric attack options that may be deployed in a conflict. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=427.32s)]

*  with the mining and processing of several critical minerals. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=449.34000000000003s)]
*  In December, China imposed an export ban to the United States on gallium, germanium and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=453.24s)]
*  antimony, all of which are important to the production of semiconductors and our defense [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=459.12s)]
*  technologies. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=463.36s)]
*  This was in direct response to U.S. export controls on chips, designed to broadly limit [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=465.40000000000003s)]

*  Russia's nuclear and conventional military capabilities, along with its demonstrated [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=490.04s)]

*  Moscow has more nuclear weapons than any other nation that could inflict catastrophic damage [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=498.36s)]
*  on the United States and the world in the event of a major war that Russian leaders [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=503.58s)]

*  The President and National Security Advisor Waltz held a press conference yesterday with [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=821.58s)]

*  The conversation was candid and sensitive. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=857.8000000000001s)]
*  But as the President and National Security Advisor stated, no classified information [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=861.04s)]

*  Ideally, these conversations occur in person. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=911.44s)]
*  However, at times, fast-moving coordination of an unclassified nature is necessary where [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQzwPDnSJJs&t=914.24s)]
