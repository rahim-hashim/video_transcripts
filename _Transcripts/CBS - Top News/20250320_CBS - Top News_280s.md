*  what this objective is [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=24.68s)]
*  yeah well sent com is one of the combat combatant command uh... regions [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=28.279999999999998s)]

*  region so they've been very busy [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=39.62s)]
*  uh... in addition to that you come [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=41.72s)]
*  just because of the way geography works is off the coast of uh... israel but in [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=43.76s)]
*  terms of uh... what's happening with the hooties [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=47.84s)]
*  officials tell us you know the end goal is simply to to get the hooties to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=50.82s)]
*  agree [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=54.72s)]
*  to stop targeting u.s. naval ships uh... and international commercial ships [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=55.64s)]
*  in that red sea region [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=60.08s)]
*  where this is become important again is because the fighting began on saturday [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=62.44s)]
*  and that was launched by u.s. forces and it's been gone going on ever since u.s. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=66.72s)]
*  officials told me this morning [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=71.12s)]
*  uh... it's ongoing it includes launches of fighter jets off the u.s. s harry s [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=72.56s)]
*  truman carrier that rami just uh... rami just uh... pointed out there [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=77.04s)]
*  number of destroyers [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=81.08s)]
*  uh... as part of that carrier strike group i can also confirm that the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=82.52s)]
*  hooties did look launch that cruise missile [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=85.96s)]
*  uh... headed toward israel [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=88.2s)]
*  but it was intercepted by israel's [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  uh... missile defense systems before it got anywhere close to its target [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=92.72s)]
*  so the initial phase of the attacks on saturday [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=96.32s)]
*  officials here tell us uh... struck thirty uh... targets at multiple locations [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=99.0s)]
*  it includes terrorist training sites [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=104.2s)]
*  uh... unmanned aerial vehicle infrastructure weapons manufacturing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=106.4s)]
*  capabilities storage facilities [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=110.32s)]
*  and target since then it included command and control centers [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=112.27999999999999s)]
*  and uh... terrorist compound which is thought to have [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=115.44s)]
*  some of the individuals who are responsible for these uh... u.a.v.s [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=118.52s)]
*  which have been incredibly effective so [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=122.08s)]
*  this is a huge dramatic escalation [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=123.96s)]
*  uh... and it's the first major military operation by this trump administration [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=126.72s)]
*  this also reports charlie winters and from the pentagon where you are stepping [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=131.44s)]
*  up a role at the u.s. southern border what form does this likely take [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=134.76s)]
*  charlie and my friend [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=142.72s)]
*  can you hear me now brother [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=144.2s)]
*  now i can yes okay got i'll just repeat the question we're talking about the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  reports of the pentagon stepping up their role at the u.s. southern border [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=150.16s)]
*  what form does that take [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=153.44s)]
*  okay so this is part of a wider campaign to militarize the border right so we [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=156.88s)]
*  reported a few days ago that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=160.84s)]
*  an additional three thousand uh... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=162.76s)]
*  active duty troops that's important to point out active duty troops to be headed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  to the border it includes uh... [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=169.12s)]
*  striker vehicles which i'm sure you're aware of right in your experience [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=170.92s)]
*  that'll bring a number of troops at the border to nine thousand so strikers [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=174.48s)]
*  actually haven't been at the border since twenty twelve [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=178.24s)]
*  so what they're talking about is setting up uh... [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=180.84s)]
*  a temporary military installation or or like a buffer zone [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=183.36s)]
*  near the border of uh... of new mexico that might actually stretch out to [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=186.92s)]
*  california again [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=190.2s)]
*  just talking hypotheticals at the moment [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=191.72s)]
*  it does raise some legal questions uh... including the posse committed to us act [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=194.24s)]
*  which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=199.12s)]
*  is a federal law that prohibits active duty troops from engaging in law [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=199.88s)]
*  enforcement [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  uh... so in his announcement secretary of state heggson said [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  the order of the deployment that striker combat team and general support [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=207.68s)]
*  aviation battalion that's to reinforce [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=211.8s)]
*  current border security operations [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=214.2s)]
*  to seal that border [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=216.51999999999998s)]
*  uh... and protect the integrity of the united states what's what's also [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=217.8s)]
*  interesting [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=220.84s)]
*  is [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  pretty important development they're sending to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=223.70000000000002s)]
*  u.s. destroyers [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=226.08s)]
*  not to obviously the border of mexico that would be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=227.56s)]
*  difficult [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=230.9s)]
*  uh... but to the gulf [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=231.60000000000002s)]

*  area [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWOjb_dqH-g&t=251.72s)]
