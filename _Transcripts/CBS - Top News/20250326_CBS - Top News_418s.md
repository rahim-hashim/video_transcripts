# Trump slaps 25% tariff on imported cars amid Signal chat fallout
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM)
*  Welcome back. Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=0.0s)]
*  As you see, President Trump right now has announced new measures [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=2.0s)]
*  imposing tariffs on automobiles. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=5.0s)]
*  The president moments ago signed an executive order that he said [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=7.0s)]
*  imposes a 25% tariff on all cars. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=11.0s)]
*  Well, this is what a definition of an import is, not made in the United States. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=15.0s)]
*  During comments in the Oval Office, the president said this measure [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=19.0s)]
*  could lead car makers here in the United States bringing back factories, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=22.0s)]
*  maybe from elsewhere. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=27.0s)]
*  I will just say, before we get to our political panel, that the car makers themselves [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=28.0s)]
*  have said that's not exactly what's going to happen and certainly not immediately. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=32.0s)]
*  The process would take three to five years minimum. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=36.0s)]
*  Liza Acevedo and Justin Safi, join me here at the desk. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=39.0s)]
*  Liza, former director of communications for then second gentleman Doug Emhoff. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=42.0s)]
*  Justin, former senior policy advisor to then Governor Jeb Bush [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=46.0s)]
*  and very familiar with Suzy Wiles and lots of other Florida Republicans [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=50.0s)]
*  close to the Trump White House. Great to have you both here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=54.0s)]
*  So, Liza, I'm sure when you worked for the second gentleman, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=57.0s)]
*  you did all sorts of national security conversations on Signal, right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=60.0s)]
*  No, we did not. Not at all, Major. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=65.0s)]
*  I will tell you, I did work at the Department of Homeland Security [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=67.0s)]
*  for Secretary Mayorkas before I worked for the second gentleman. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=70.0s)]
*  And any time we were discussing even sensitive information, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=74.0s)]
*  we would go into something called a SCIF. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=77.0s)]
*  If I had to brief the Secretary of Homeland Security, I'm going to his office. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=79.0s)]
*  And help my audience remember what that acronym stands for, SCIF. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=82.0s)]
*  Secured Compartmented Information Facility. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=85.0s)]
*  You got it. We were not using Signal as a way to distribute sensitive [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=88.0s)]
*  or confidential information. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=92.0s)]
*  So when I think about what this White House is doing right now, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=94.0s)]
*  frankly I feel like they're just lying and gaslighting to the American public [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=98.0s)]
*  and I don't understand it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=102.0s)]
*  This was confidential information that was in those messages. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=103.0s)]
*  They need to own it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=106.0s)]
*  And on top of that, Major, where I think it's completely not acceptable, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=107.0s)]
*  is they put the lives of service members of our men and women [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=110.0s)]
*  in military, in uniform, on the line. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=114.0s)]
*  And I feel like that's completely unacceptable. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=116.0s)]
*  Justin, you know that there is an option for any White House in a difficult situation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=118.0s)]
*  Particularly one of its own creation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=124.0s)]
*  I've covered White Houses dating back to 2000. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=126.0s)]
*  You have two options. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=128.0s)]
*  String out a story by mucking up your initial reaction [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=130.0s)]
*  or owning something, calling it what it is, and then moving on. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=134.0s)]
*  The White House is still struggling with option one. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=140.0s)]
*  Blaming the messenger, diverting attention, saying something it is and it isn't. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=144.0s)]
*  They could do one thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=150.0s)]
*  The operation succeeded. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=153.0s)]
*  We screwed up in this instance and we're moving on. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=155.0s)]
*  Why not? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=158.0s)]
*  I've had that conversation with a lot of friends and colleagues. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=159.0s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=162.0s)]
*  I think the White House is determining on the fly what their response is going to be. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=163.0s)]
*  But I think that what we have seen is some level of consistency [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=170.0s)]
*  of trying to not admit that anything was done wrong. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=174.0s)]
*  Although we did see Secretary Rubio said a mistake was made. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=180.0s)]
*  But only saying the mistake was including Jeff Goldberg from the Atlantic, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=186.0s)]
*  not communicating on signal. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=189.0s)]
*  And our James Laporta sat at this desk yesterday and read out loud [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=192.0s)]
*  a Trump-era National Security Agency advisory [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=196.0s)]
*  do not communicate anything sensitive on signal. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=199.0s)]
*  That's an obvious screw up. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=203.0s)]
*  You would agree with that? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=205.0s)]
*  I would agree that these conversations should not be taking place on signal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=207.0s)]
*  I don't think that... [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=212.0s)]
*  I think that it's a teachable moment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=214.0s)]
*  I think that the administration will take away a lot from this experience. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=217.0s)]
*  And I think that I would be surprised if administration officials in the future [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=222.0s)]
*  use signal for these types of military action conversations. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=227.0s)]
*  And Liza, you well remember during your time with the Biden administration [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=232.0s)]
*  how sympathetic Republicans were to teachable moments. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=235.0s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=238.0s)]
*  So I'm sure you'll be simply sympathetic. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=239.0s)]
*  I've thought about this a number of ways. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=241.0s)]
*  If this happened under the Biden administration, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=243.0s)]
*  Republicans would be out there on the front lines right now [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=245.0s)]
*  screaming that President Biden should get rid of Jake Sullivan, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=248.0s)]
*  that the Secretary of Defense should be stepping down. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=251.0s)]
*  So frankly, I think Democrats need to continue to keep the pressure on this right now. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=253.0s)]
*  I hear them calling for resignations and for people to be fired. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=256.0s)]
*  And I do think there needs to be some accountability in this moment. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=259.0s)]
*  Now, whether Republicans have the courage to actually stand up and say something, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=262.0s)]
*  that's to be told. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=266.0s)]
*  Let me press you on an underlying issue, though. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=267.0s)]
*  The mission itself wasn't compromised, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=269.0s)]
*  and it appeared to send a very direct signal to the Houthis about something that matters, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=272.0s)]
*  not just the United States, but to all of Europe, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=276.0s)]
*  which is moving commercial vessels without harassment through the Red Sea. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=278.0s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense had to go onto a server. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=284.0s)]
*  He had to copy information from that server and manually put it into a signal chat. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=288.0s)]
*  There are so many things that have messed up with that on its face, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=294.0s)]
*  and again, I will bring it back to the lives of service members who were on the ground. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=297.0s)]
*  But you will stipulate the mission was a success, and it's probably a good thing. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=301.0s)]
*  They should have never done this over a signal. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=305.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=307.0s)]
*  I'll say the mission was a success, and that's what's being lost. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=308.0s)]
*  This is a process story. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=312.0s)]
*  The mistake was made. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=313.0s)]
*  I'm sure it won't happen again. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=314.0s)]
*  And the mission itself was a success, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=316.0s)]
*  which is why I think at the end of the day, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=318.0s)]
*  it's not going to be tremendously politically damaging to the administration, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=320.0s)]
*  because at the end of the day, it's not sending a message to Iran [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=323.0s)]
*  that you have a different administration than the Biden administration [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=326.0s)]
*  that let the Houthis operate without penalty, without consequence. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=329.0s)]
*  Let's quickly get to tariffs. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=332.0s)]
*  Justin, are you confident that wherever the president lands on tariffs, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=333.0s)]
*  now with 25% on autos, maybe auto parts, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=338.0s)]
*  which will inevitably raise sticker prices for American consumers? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=341.0s)]
*  Everyone pretty much agrees to that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=346.0s)]
*  Is that going to work politically? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=349.0s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=350.0s)]
*  I mean, I think that the president... [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=351.0s)]
*  What's your hunch? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=352.0s)]
*  Well, I think that... [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=353.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=354.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=355.0s)]
*  And it depends on who the tariffs are applied to. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=356.0s)]
*  We just saw the announcement you just made [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=359.0s)]
*  about the executive order that was signed today. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=361.0s)]
*  But the attempt is to try to bring more manufacturing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=363.0s)]
*  and increase the U.S. industrial base. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=366.0s)]
*  It may be successful. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=369.0s)]
*  Economists differ on whether it will be. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=370.0s)]
*  Clearly, there's a trade imbalance with the United States. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=373.0s)]
*  We have massive trade deficits with countries around the world, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=375.0s)]
*  with Europe, with Asia, and President Trump's trying to rebalance it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=378.0s)]
*  It's very similar. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=382.0s)]
*  I'm old enough to remember Ross Perot talking about a giant sucking sound [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=383.0s)]
*  in the 1992 presidential debate. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=387.0s)]
*  So this is not a new issue. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=389.0s)]
*  It's an issue that's been at the forefront of U.S. economic policy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDg095aT-bM&t=391.0s)]
