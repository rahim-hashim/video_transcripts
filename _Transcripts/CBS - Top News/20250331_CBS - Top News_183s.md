# New poll shows Americans are worried about the economy under Trump
**CBS - Top News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA)
*  And we mentioned some of the fresh CBS News polling. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=0.0s)]
*  We've got more for you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=2.88s)]
*  The public's opinion of the president's economic policies, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=3.88s)]
*  it isn't good right now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=6.92s)]
*  We asked people in January before the inauguration [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=8.28s)]
*  whether they expected the president's policies to make [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=10.94s)]
*  them better off financially. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=13.22s)]
*  And if you look closely here, 42% [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=15.32s)]
*  said they expected to be doing better. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=17.36s)]
*  But now only 23% say they're doing well [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=20.04s)]
*  under this administration. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=22.84s)]
*  CBS News executive director of elections and surveys, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=24.32s)]
*  Anthony Salvanto, breaks down what's behind all this [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=26.96s)]
*  and another area where the president has stronger numbers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=30.16s)]
*  We know this week brought some tough economic news. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=34.32s)]
*  And Americans told us in recent polling [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  they still rate the economy as bad. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=38.6s)]
*  So what happens now is they evaluate [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=41.0s)]
*  what the Trump administration is doing on that front. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=43.24s)]
*  Let me start with this measure of focus. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=46.44s)]
*  Because early on in an administration, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=48.36s)]
*  it's often about what the public thinks [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=51.02s)]
*  a president is trying to do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=53.44s)]
*  Well, look at this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=55.08s)]
*  Nearly 2 thirds say the administration [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=56.16s)]
*  not focused enough on trying to lower prices. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=58.08s)]
*  But a majority does think that they're focused too much [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  on imposing new tariffs. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=65.32s)]
*  Now, why is that important? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=67.12s)]
*  It's because of what they think tariffs might do. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  I tested this. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=72.52s)]
*  What might they do in the short term and the long term? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=73.6s)]
*  Because the administration's argument, of course, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=76.44s)]
*  is partly that they might be positive over the long haul. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=78.4s)]
*  Well, look, big numbers think the tariffs will raise prices [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=81.47999999999999s)]
*  in the short term. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=84.56s)]
*  But there are also many who think that they would raise prices [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=85.64s)]
*  in the long term too. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=88.67999999999999s)]
*  So take a look, though, at what happens [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=90.64s)]
*  to Donald Trump's overall approval numbers. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=93.96s)]
*  They've ticked down on handling the economy, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=96.52s)]
*  ticked down on handling inflation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=99.16s)]
*  Let me turn to immigration, though, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=101.16s)]
*  because that is net positive for the president. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  So let me show you why. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=106.56s)]
*  Not just handling immigration, but also in particular, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=108.0s)]
*  you get majority approval for his program [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=112.16000000000001s)]
*  to deport immigrants who are in the US illegally. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  That remains positive. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  Another big topic, of course, in the news [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=120.48s)]
*  is changes to the federal workforce. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=123.04s)]
*  That continues to split Americans. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  But one measure that I think worth watching is, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  do you think those cuts will have impact [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=131.08s)]
*  that matters, that you care about? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=133.96s)]
*  Well, even a third of Republicans feel that it will, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=136.0s)]
*  big majorities of independents and Democrats think so. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=139.84s)]
*  So that's certainly something to watch. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=143.36s)]
*  And then, of course, what happens [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=145.08s)]
*  if we talk about checks and balances? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  Should federal judges be allowed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=149.28s)]
*  to review a president's policies? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=151.52s)]
*  Big majorities overall think so, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=153.76000000000002s)]
*  slight majority of Republicans as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=156.0s)]
*  But should, and some on the right talk about this, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  there be efforts to impeach federal judges [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=161.72s)]
*  who rule against Donald Trump's policies? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=164.08s)]
*  We looked at that, and there is a majority of Republicans [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=166.72s)]
*  who would support those efforts as well. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  All part of the dynamic that's going on here in Washington [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=172.88s)]
*  and out in America with immigration, with the economy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=176.24s)]
*  That's a look at the latest CBS News poll. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=179.24s)]
*  All right, Anthony, thank you for that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UroWxi-FcA&t=181.68s)]
