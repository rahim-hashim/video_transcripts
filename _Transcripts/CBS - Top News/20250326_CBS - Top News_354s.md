*  that's been asked by the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=59.92s)]
*  Secretary of State there [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  Pete Hex F and the others [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=62.92s)]
*  are handling this whole [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=63.36s)]
*  situation. The words that [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=67.36s)]
*  can be described to what [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  they're saying is disbelief [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=70.56s)]
*  and confusion. They simply [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=73.16s)]
*  do not believe the messaging [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=76.44s)]
*  from the Trump [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=76.84s)]
*  administration right now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=80.44s)]
*  And that's because members [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=82.44s)]
*  of the intelligence [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=84.04s)]
*  community members of the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=85.44s)]
*  intelligence community [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=86.52s)]
*  are not aware of this. They [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=87.52s)]
*  go through operational [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=89.0s)]
*  security training. So when [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=89.8s)]
*  they're saying, well, none [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=90.4s)]
*  of this was classified or [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=91.0s)]
*  you know, no harm, no foul [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=93.4s)]
*  here. They're just not [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=94.0s)]
*  believing it. And they're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=96.36s)]
*  confused on how this [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=98.0s)]
*  information could not be [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=98.6s)]
*  classified. So these you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=101.44s)]
*  know, we just heard [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=103.0s)]
*  Defense Secretary Hex F say [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  there that, well, these [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=104.8s)]
*  aren't war plans, but they [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=105.64s)]
*  are usually included in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  what are called operation [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=109.88s)]
*  orders or an op award in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=110.48s)]
*  military parlance. And [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=113.28s)]
*  operations order would [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=114.88s)]
*  include the time that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=116.0s)]
*  would go down. And then [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=118.0s)]
*  the details of what type [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  of aircraft would be [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=122.2s)]
*  targeting who the who the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  militia, you know what [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=126.2s)]
*  time that would those [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  strikes would go down. So [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  all that information would [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=132.44s)]
*  be included in operation [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=134.52s)]
*  orders and typically [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=135.08s)]
*  operation orders are [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=135.68s)]
*  classified. And James, just [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=139.36s)]
*  as you just said, there [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=140.96s)]
*  seems to be some confusion [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=142.36s)]
*  over whether the chat [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=143.96s)]
*  should be classified or [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=146.24s)]
*  classified. And we have [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=147.24s)]
*  a couple of questions of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  the chat while testifying [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  on Capitol Hill this [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  morning. So let's take a [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=151.12s)]
*  listen to that. We'll talk [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBq-lytuPI&t=151.68s)]
