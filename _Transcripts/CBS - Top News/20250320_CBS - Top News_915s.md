# Trump signs executive order to begin dismantling Department of Education
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00)
*  I just want to announce that I signed a proclamation a few moments ago honoring the 250th anniversary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=0.0s)]
*  of Patrick Henry's famous speech to the Second Virginia Convention, in which he declared [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=8.56s)]
*  very well-known, very famous words, give me liberty or give me death. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=14.72s)]
*  Has anyone heard the phrase? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=19.64s)]
*  I think most of you have. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=21.02s)]
*  And moments ago I also signed an executive order to dramatically increase production [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=27.86s)]
*  of critical minerals and rare earths. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=32.26s)]
*  It's a big thing in this country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=34.7s)]
*  And as you know, we're also signing agreements in various locations to unlock rare earths [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=36.78s)]
*  and minerals and lots of other things all over the world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=44.42s)]
*  But in particular, Ukraine, we're doing very well with regard to Ukraine and Russia. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=48.1s)]
*  One of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earths [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  with Ukraine, which they have tremendous value in rare earth, and we appreciate that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=60.12s)]
*  And we spoke yesterday with, as you know, President Putin and President Zelensky. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=66.16s)]
*  And we would love to see that come to an end. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=72.6s)]
*  And I think we're doing pretty well in that regard. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=74.72s)]
*  So hopefully we could save thousands of people a week from dying. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=77.36s)]
*  That's what it's all about. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=81.38s)]
*  We're dying so unnecessarily, and I believe we'll get it done. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=82.38s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=87.82s)]
*  But I believe we'll get it done. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=89.5s)]
*  Today we take a very historic action that was 45 years in the making. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  In a few moments I will sign an executive order to begin eliminating the Federal Department [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=97.61999999999999s)]
*  of Education once and for all. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=103.36s)]
*  And it sounds strange, doesn't it? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=112.38s)]
*  Department of Education, we're going to eliminate it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=117.58s)]
*  And everybody knows it's right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=119.66s)]
*  And the Democrats know it's right, and I hope they're going to be voting for it because [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=122.66s)]
*  ultimately it may come before them. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=126.6s)]
*  But everybody knows it's right. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=128.62s)]
*  And we have to get our children educated. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=131.34s)]
*  We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=134.38s)]
*  time. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=140.62s)]
*  And we're pleased to be joined today by the woman who I chose because she's an extraordinary [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  person. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=148.02s)]
*  And hopefully she will be our last Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=149.78s)]
*  Linda. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=154.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=155.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=156.5s)]
*  That's another interesting statement. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=162.06s)]
*  These are very — it's an interesting opening, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=163.66s)]
*  But it's true, and we've — people — it's been amazing how popular this has been. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=166.32s)]
*  I tell people that this is what I'm doing today, and they say, oh, that's — it's [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=170.86s)]
*  about time. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=175.78s)]
*  Everybody says it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=176.78s)]
*  Republicans and Democrats have said it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=177.78s)]
*  They're all saying it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=180.38000000000002s)]
*  Also with us are some terrific people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=181.38000000000002s)]

*  When President Carter created the Federal Education Department in 1979, it was opposed [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=280.58000000000004s)]
*  by members of his own cabinet, as well as the American Federation of Teachers, the New [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=286.84s)]
*  York Times editorial board, and the famed Democrat Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=292.32s)]
*  History has proven them right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=299.2s)]
*  Absolutely right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=301.28s)]
*  After 45 years, the United States spends more money on education by far than any other country [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=302.28s)]
*  and spends likewise by far more money per pupil than any country, and it's not even [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=308.88s)]
*  close. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=315.44s)]
*  We rank near the bottom of the list in terms of success. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=316.76s)]
*  It's an amazing stat. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=321.36s)]
*  Those are two stats you don't want. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=323.44s)]
*  The most money spent per pupil, and you're at the bottom of the list. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=324.68s)]
*  And that's where we are, like it or not. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=328.16s)]
*  And we've been there for a long time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=330.28s)]
*  70 percent of eighth graders are not proficient in either reading or in math. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=332.28s)]
*  70 percent. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=338.8s)]
*  40 percent of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=339.8s)]
*  We can't read. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=343.64s)]
*  Students in our public elementary and middle schools score worse in reading today than [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=345.24s)]
*  when the department opened by a lot. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=350.2s)]
*  In Baltimore, 40 percent of the high schools have zero students who can do basic mathematics. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=354.84s)]
*  Not even the very simplest of mathematics. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  I said, give me your definition of basic, and they're talking about like adding a few [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=363.64s)]
*  numbers together. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=368.56s)]
*  Despite these breathtaking failures, the department's discretionary budget has exploded [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=370.28s)]
*  by 600 percent in a very short period of time and employs bureaucrats in buildings all over [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=375.32s)]
*  Washington, D.C. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=382.52s)]
*  And as a former real estate person, I will tell you, I ride through the streets of Washington [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  and it says Department of Education, Department of Education. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  I said, how do you fill those buildings? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=392.91999999999996s)]
*  It's crazy what's happened over the years. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=395.0s)]
*  I'm pleased to report that after offering these federal employees two generous buyout [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=398.12s)]
*  options and they were very generous and they're good people, but they were very generous. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  My administration has initiated a reduction in force and we're already cutting numbers [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=409.6s)]
*  that were really surprising to a lot that we were able to do it so successfully. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=415.86s)]
*  And we've cut the number of bureaucrats in half. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=421.24s)]
*  50 percent have taken office, which is great. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=424.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=431.96s)]
*  Under the action, I am taking today a small handful of Democrats and others that we have [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=432.96s)]
*  employed for a long time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=440.08s)]
*  And there are some Republicans, but not too many, I have to be honest with you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=441.68s)]
*  But the department's useful functions, and such as, and they're in charge of them, Pell [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=445.64s)]
*  grants, Title I funding, resources for children with disabilities and special needs will be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=451.96s)]
*  preserved, fully preserved. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=456.88s)]
*  They're all going to be so. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=460.32s)]
*  If you look at the Pell grants, supposed to be a very good program, Title I funding, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=461.44s)]
*  and resources for children with special disabilities and special needs, they're going to be preserved [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=466.32s)]
*  in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=472.47999999999996s)]
*  good care of them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  And that's very important to Linda, I know, and it's very important to all of us. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=480.47999999999996s)]
*  But beyond these core necessities, my administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=484.79999999999995s)]
*  department. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=490.67999999999995s)]
*  We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=491.67999999999995s)]
*  It's doing us no good. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=494.88s)]
*  We want to return our students to the states where just some of the governors here are [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=495.96s)]
*  so happy about this. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=501.15999999999997s)]
*  They want education to come back to them, to come back to the states, and they're going [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=502.76s)]
*  to do a phenomenal job. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=507.0s)]
*  You know, if you look Denmark, Norway, Sweden, I have to tell you, I give them a lot of credit. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=508.88s)]
*  China's top ten. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=515.72s)]
*  And so we can't now say that bigness is making it impossible to educate because China's very [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=518.24s)]
*  big. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=523.56s)]
*  But you have countries that do a very good job in education. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=524.76s)]
*  And I really believe, like some of the governors here today, from states that run very, very [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=528.4s)]
*  well, including a big state like Texas, but states that run very well are going to have [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=533.4s)]
*  education that will be as good as Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and those top Finland, those top countries [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=539.5600000000001s)]
*  that do so well with education. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=546.2s)]
*  I think they'll have, they'll do every bit as well. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  And what do you think about that, Governor? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  Do you agree? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=553.08s)]
*  I think so. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=554.08s)]
*  Ron, do you agree? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=555.08s)]
*  I think so. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=556.08s)]
*  Florida, Iowa. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=557.08s)]
*  That's right. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=558.08s)]
*  I really believe that they'll be as good as any of them. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=559.08s)]
*  And then you'll have some laggards and we'll work with them. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=564.24s)]
*  And we can all tell you who the laggards will be right now, probably, but let's not get [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=569.0799999999999s)]
*  into that. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=572.36s)]
*  But we'll work with them and we're going to make them, they'll do a job. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=574.04s)]
*  I think they'll do a job and they'll go to sections of the state. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=577.6s)]
*  For instance, New York, you'll have a Manhattan and you'll have a Suffolk County and you'll [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=580.68s)]
*  have a Nassau County and you'll have Westchester County. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=586.1999999999999s)]
*  You'll do four or five or six of them. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=589.48s)]
*  You have upstate New York and those counties, I think, are going to do very well. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=591.1999999999999s)]
*  I think ultimately Manhattan should do very well, but we'll break it down into sections [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=595.12s)]
*  and I think it'll be really, really good. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  And they're going to be probably the tougher ones, but I think they have a chance to do [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=602.44s)]
*  really well. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=606.14s)]
*  But we're going to be returning education, very simply, back to the states where it belongs. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=608.4000000000001s)]
*  And this is a very popular thing to do, but much more importantly, it's a common sense [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=615.08s)]
*  thing to do and it's going to work. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=619.9000000000001s)]
*  Absolutely, it's going to work. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=622.12s)]
*  I can tell you from dealing with the governors and others in the state, they want it so badly. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=624.0400000000001s)]
*  They want to take their children back and really teach their children individually. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  Probably the cost will be half and the education will be maybe many, many times better. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=636.0s)]
*  So we look forward to this. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=643.0s)]
*  I want to just make one little personal statement. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=645.4s)]
*  Teachers to me are among the most important people in this country and we're going to [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=648.4s)]
*  take care of our teachers. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=653.04s)]
*  And I don't care if they're in the union or not in the union, that doesn't matter. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=654.56s)]
*  But we're going to take care of our teachers and I believe the states will take actually [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  better care of them than they are taking care of right now. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=664.8s)]
*  They'll work all sorts of systems and even merit systems. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=669.3199999999999s)]
*  Those great teachers are going to be maybe a little bit better rewarded or maybe that's [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=672.8s)]
*  the way it should be, but the states are going to make that decision. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=677.0s)]
*  But we're going to love and cherish our teachers along with our children and they're going [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  to work with the parents and they're going to work with everybody else and it's going [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=684.16s)]
*  to be an amazing thing to watch and it's really going to be something special. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=687.7199999999999s)]
*  And Linda, you're presiding over something that's so important and you're going to do [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  a fantastic job, just like you have your whole life. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=696.28s)]
*  I know your whole life I've been watching you. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=698.8s)]
*  I've been watching you for a long time. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=701.4s)]
*  She's had nothing but success. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=703.0s)]
*  So it's tremendous to have you and hopefully you won't be there too long, but we're going [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=705.12s)]
*  to find something else for you, Linda. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=710.0400000000001s)]
*  So this will conclude what we are talking about with respect to our most cherished group [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  of people and that's our children. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=721.2800000000001s)]
*  We want to have our children well educated. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=723.0s)]
*  We want them to love going to school. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=725.84s)]
*  We have examples of it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=728.14s)]
*  Look at those beautiful bright-eyed faces. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=729.5200000000001s)]
*  They are so smart. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=733.0s)]
*  They are so smart. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=735.28s)]
*  And with that I'm going to come down and we're going to sign a very important document and [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=737.64s)]
*  we're going to be on our way. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=743.4s)]
*  People have wanted to do this for many, many years, for many, many decades and I don't [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=744.64s)]
*  know, no president ever got around to doing it, but I'm getting around to doing it. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=749.36s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=753.6s)]
*  Hello. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=763.0s)]
*  Good-looking people here. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=764.0s)]
*  Should I do this? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=765.0s)]
*  Can I do it? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=766.0s)]
*  Yeah, do it. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=767.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=768.0s)]
*  Maybe I'll just read to the special points. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=769.0s)]
*  I was very lucky I saw the other document that turned out to be very good for the country [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=771.0s)]
*  the country and I said let's use that same pen. I don't know is anybody superstitious? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=797.0s)]
*  Let's use that same pen. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=801.0s)]
*  The president just signing the executive order to dismantle the education department. We had expected this news conference. He signed it and he made it clear that he wants to bring education back to the states. And as you can see, he had even some students there sitting at desks as this unfolded. So right now the Trump administration is going to be giving guidance about what would mean what would happen now that the DOE is dismantled. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=861.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, he still needs full approval of the Congress to make this happen. So again, you're looking at not live pictures from the White House. President Trump just signed the order to dismantle the education department. What does this mean for special education? What does this mean for loans? What does this mean for Pell grants? We're going to break it down with our correspondents next. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8lYuUCQW00&t=890.0s)]
