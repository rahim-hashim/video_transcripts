# New poll shows Most Americans are concerned about the economy
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0)
*  All right, fresh news, CBS News polling shows a majority of Americans are not feeling great [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=0.0s)]
*  about the economy. That may be no surprise to you. Anthony Salvanto explains what's behind these [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=5.04s)]
*  numbers. Tracking views of the economy and here's something that hasn't changed. Most Americans [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=10.08s)]
*  continuing to say that they think the economy is bad. Why is that? Well, when we ask people, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=17.04s)]
*  it's much the same story as it's been for years since the pandemic. It's prices. That's the top [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=22.96s)]
*  reason they give for why they rate the economy that way. But let's take a look at their outlook [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=29.04s)]
*  and there we see a kind of collective uncertainty. People spread out among whether they think that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=35.12s)]
*  the economy might be booming or growing or holding steady or slowing and in recession. And that, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=42.8s)]
*  I want to point out, has actually increased over the last month. Slightly more people saying they [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  think looking at the year ahead that things might go into recession. And that is very much in part [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=54.96s)]
*  because they say their incomes still aren't keeping up with inflation. And most Americans [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=61.6s)]
*  say that prices around them are still rising. That's the latest from a CBS News poll. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=67.84s)]
*  All right, Anthony, thank you for that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxWks218vi0&t=74.08s)]
