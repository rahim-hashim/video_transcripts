# American George Glezmann released by Taliban 2 years after arrest in Afghanistan
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4)
*  Today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed a Delta Airlines mechanic is on his way back [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=0.0s)]
*  to the United States after more than two years of detainment by Taliban authorities. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=6.32s)]
*  This comes right after Taliban leaders met with U.S. officials for diplomacy talks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=10.96s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News correspondent Chanel Call for more on the story. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=15.4s)]
*  Chanel, good to see you today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=19.48s)]
*  Can you break down what happened here for us? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=20.86s)]
*  Yeah, good to see you too, Mugo. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=23.16s)]
*  So the State Department essentially saying George Glassman, who was held by the Taliban [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=25.48s)]
*  for more than two years, has now been released. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=30.44s)]
*  The government says this is someone who was abducted by the Taliban back in December of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=33.6s)]
*  2022. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  He was there as a tourist and he was just released today as a result of a new deal brokered [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  between the U.S. and Qatar. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Glassman now the third American detainee to be released by the Taliban since January. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=48.2s)]
*  And I want to read you part of a statement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that was [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=55.08s)]
*  just released this morning. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=59.26s)]
*  It reads in part, George joins American Ryan Corbett and William McEntee, who were released [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=60.839999999999996s)]
*  from Afghanistan on the night of President Trump's inauguration and returned home to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=66.88s)]
*  their families. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=71.16s)]
*  It goes on to say George's release is a positive and constructive step. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=72.36s)]
*  It is also a reminder that other Americans are still detained in Afghanistan. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=77.32s)]
*  President Trump will continue his tireless work to free all Americans unjustly detained [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=83.48s)]
*  around the world. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, Mugo, important to note the deal here to release the last two American detainees [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=89.32000000000001s)]
*  that I just mentioned, Ryan Corbett and William McEntee. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=93.92s)]
*  That was arranged in the final days of the Biden administration. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=97.5s)]
*  And that also important to note, it involved an exchange for someone named Khan Mohammed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=100.72s)]
*  This was somebody who was sentenced to two life terms after being convicted here in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  U.S. under the narco terrorism laws. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  This release today though of George Gleesman, that did not require the U.S. to give up a prisoner. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  It was seen more as a goodwill gesture as the Taliban now is trying to normalize relations [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=119.3s)]
*  between the U.S. and Afghanistan. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  CBS News correspondent Chanel Call, thank you so much for that update. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvYJdNBHpc4&t=127.06s)]
