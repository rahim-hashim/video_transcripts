# Markets plummet over U.S. inflation fears, incoming tariffs
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I)
*  The markets ended the week with a significant sell-off amid concerns over President Trump's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=0.0s)]
*  incoming tariffs and inflation. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=4.96s)]
*  The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=7.32s)]
*  Price Index, was worse than economists expected. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=12.76s)]
*  That figure, which excludes energy and food prices, ticked up to 2.8 percent in February [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=16.56s)]
*  from 12 months prior. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=22.04s)]
*  Consumer sentiment also fell to its lowest level in nearly three years. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=24.0s)]
*  Isabel Wang joins us now to break the sell-down. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=28.0s)]
*  She's a markets reporter for the financial news site MarketWatch. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=29.84s)]
*  Isabel, what were the biggest drivers behind today's sell-off? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=32.72s)]
*  So, yes, I would say it was a combination of sticky inflation and worries over consumer [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=36.8s)]
*  spending, and they are getting much of the blame. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=42.92s)]
*  So, first of all, like you just mentioned, the February PC inflation data showed inflation [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=46.84s)]
*  stronger than expected, which pushed it above the 2 percent goal of the Federal Reserve. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=52.6s)]
*  But also in that same report, it also showed that personal spending disappointed in February, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=58.2s)]
*  as Americans have become more cautious about how much they spend on daily products, which [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=63.48s)]
*  is not a really good sign for the economy. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=69.24s)]
*  Also, at the same time, consumer confidence fell to its lowest level in over two years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=71.48s)]
*  So, it was a combination of a batch of disappointing economic and sentiment data that really drove [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=77.64s)]
*  the sell-off today. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=83.16s)]
*  And the president is planning on imposing a new round of tariffs on April 2, a day he's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=84.68s)]
*  calling Liberation Day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=89.16s)]
*  What impact could this have on the stock market and the economy? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=90.92s)]
*  I would say the stock market, especially investors, are really laser-focused on what's going to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=96.28s)]
*  happen next week, the April 2nd tariff deadline, or so-called Liberation Day, because investors [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=102.12s)]
*  really hope that any developments on the tariff front could really clear the policy uncertainty [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=108.04s)]
*  that has clouded the financial markets for many, many weeks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  But I would say what's going to happen is still anyone's guess because of the frequent [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  shift in tariff threads, like leaving investors uncertain about what's going to happen, and more [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=122.44s)]
*  importantly, its impact on the economy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=127.56s)]
*  So, I would say maybe it's worth noting April 2nd is not the end of all these tariff tensions, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=131.39999999999998s)]
*  but because we're still at the very beginning of the trade tensions with our trading partners, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=137.16s)]
*  and the vulnerabilities they're triggering in the financial markets is still at the very beginning. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=143.23999999999998s)]
*  So, investors really need to buckle up for that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=147.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=150.84s)]
*  Isabel Wang, thank you so much. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vXKYMmI0I&t=151.16s)]
