# Tense moments at House Intelligence Committee hearing as Signal group texts controversy grows
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A)
*  Top security leaders back in Capitol Hill and right now they are testifying before the House Intelligence Committee for a hearing on worldwide threats. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=0.0s)]
*  This is all happening of course while Trump administration officials face criticism over their participation in that group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=7.32s)]
*  Reportedly discussing plans to attack targets in Yemen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=15.8s)]
*  Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe are among those facing the fire there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  So let's get to CBS News correspondent Chanel Carl in our newsroom always keeping us current and letting us know what is happening right now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=25.72s)]
*  What are you watching for Chanel? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=32.28s)]
*  Well good to see you read. So the line of questioning this morning really sharply focused on whether the information in that group chat was in fact classified and whether it was appropriate to use that signal app to discuss the weekend attack on Yemen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=34.56s)]
*  Listen to this exchange from Congresswoman Chrissy Hulahan pressing Tulsi Gabbard on this point of what really is classified. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  I would argue that Secretary Hegseth if he had the dignity that he needs to have should be walking his resignation in because I believe that his probably is heading toward being relieved of his duty based on what I think are significant and illegal leaks most likely. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=56.48s)]
*  I would like it if you would please commit to this organization that you will follow the law and I would like it if you would also investigate what is likely to be more than just this chat because if there's one there's more than one. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=71.4s)]
*  If there's smoke there's fire. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=82.92s)]
*  Would you please obligate yourself and your organization to that investigation? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=84.6s)]
*  Yeah Congresswoman yes I will follow the law. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=88.52s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=90.8s)]
*  And Director Patel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=92.08s)]
*  And I also want to play out for you read another really fiery moment that happened about an hour ago with Democratic Congressman Jimmy Gomez. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=93.64s)]
*  To your knowledge do you know whether Pete Hegseth had been drinking before he leaked classified information? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=102.44s)]
*  I don't have any knowledge of Secretary Hegseth's personal habits. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=109.12s)]
*  Director Radcliffe same question. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=114.12s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=120.12s)]
*  You know no I'm going to answer that I think that's an offensive line of questioning the answer is no. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=121.12s)]
*  I find it interesting that you want to. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=126.12s)]
*  Hey I yield back. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=128.12s)]
*  No I'm going to answer. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=129.12s)]
*  Director. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=130.12s)]
*  You asked me a question you want to answer? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=131.12s)]
*  No listen. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=132.12s)]
*  You don't want to focus on the good work that the CIA is doing that the intelligence community. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=133.12s)]
*  Director I want to talk about. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=137.12s)]
*  I want to claim my time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=138.12s)]
*  Director I reclaim my time. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=139.12s)]
*  I have huge respect for the CIA. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=142.12s)]
*  Huge respect for our men and women in uniform. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=145.12s)]
*  But this was a question that's on the top of minds of every American. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=148.12s)]
*  He stood in front of a podium in Europe holding a drink. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=154.12s)]
*  So of course we want to know if his performance is compromised. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=159.12s)]
*  If people were asking if General Austin was compromised because of a heart issue. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=164.12s)]
*  Was his performance compromised because of a successful strike? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=172.12s)]
*  I yield back. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=176.12s)]
*  You want to know? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=177.12s)]
*  I reclaim my time. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=178.12s)]
*  You want to talk about accepting responsibility? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=179.12s)]
*  I reclaim my time. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=181.12s)]
*  Do you think you should accept responsibility for a successful strike to make Americans safer? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=182.12s)]
*  I reclaim my time. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=186.12s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=189.12s)]
*  This is serious. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=191.12s)]
*  As somebody we've been briefed in this committee about using signal. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=194.12s)]
*  One of the things they basically said the most secure phone call, the least secure text, messaging. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=197.12s)]
*  And we know that your people are Russians, Chinese are on your phone. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=204.12s)]
*  The gentleman's time's expired. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=209.12s)]
*  Gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Klein. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=211.12s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=214.12s)]
*  I'm going to give... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=216.12s)]
*  This time again we've heard from Republicans, including Ratcliffe, that the mission was successful this weekend. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=217.12s)]
*  But what we're hearing from critics and Democratic lawmakers is that, well, that may not have been the case if this information was leaked to someone else. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=224.12s)]
*  We also heard repeatedly from Democratic lawmakers this morning asking for an investigation into this matter. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=233.12s)]
*  FBI Director Cash Patel was asked about this moments ago. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=240.12s)]
*  He said, look, I'm not going to discuss this. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=243.12s)]
*  I also need to mention that it does appear that the hearing is in recess right now. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=246.12s)]
*  Hearing that they will reconvene around 2 p.m. Eastern time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=250.12s)]
*  Again, this is the open portion of this meeting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=254.12s)]
*  Later on doors will close. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=256.12s)]
*  We won't be able to listen into what they're talking about. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=258.12s)]
*  So we'll bring you all of the big moments as they happen during this open hearing this morning. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=260.12s)]
*  Keeping us current with call. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=265.12s)]
*  Chanel Call. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=266.12s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMALZ1ekV1A&t=267.12s)]
