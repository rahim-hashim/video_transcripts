# Ukraine, Russia trade attacks as Rubio efforts talks in Saudi Arabia
**CBS - Top News:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As)
*  Kyiv and Moscow traded deadly drone attacks overnight. You see the video there on our monitors. The Ukrainian capital launched its largest on Moscow since before started. At this hour, we know two died. 18 others injured Russian capitals for airports also forced to briefly shut down in the midst of this. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Air Force said it also defended against Russian ballistic missiles and drones overnight. So the attacks came ahead of those high stakes talks between top D. C. And Kyiv officials there in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=0.0s)]
*  The Ukrainian government is also working on a new plan to end the war with Russia. The Russian government is also working on a new plan to end the war with Russia. In fact, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security adviser Mike Waltz and their Ukrainian counterparts are in attendance. Leaders from both sides hope that that meeting helps to mend the relationship after last month's disastrous off the rails meeting in the Oval Office. Sources tell our own Jennifer Jacobs that U. S. Envoy Steve Witkoff will go to Russia later this week. The goal there. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=30.0s)]

*  I think there are a number of reasons, but Saudi Arabia is looked upon as a very neutral interlocutor between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. They're also under Crown Prince Salman, Mohammed bin Salman, are trying to position the kingdom as a big diplomatic player in the region and also on the world stage. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=150.0s)]
*  I think they're also showing that they want to perhaps lessen their reliance on the United States and solve diplomatic headaches themselves. I have to put a quick footnote to that, if I may, because I think all of us in the media ecosystem should. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=170.0s)]
*  I mean, this is also the same regime that was behind the assassination of the Washington Post colonist, Mr. Khashoggi. Part of me seems to think that they're trying to improve their reputation from those very dark days as well. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=186.0s)]
*  Fascinating dynamic. I just wanted to ask that question, and thank you so much for the answer. I'm also harkening back to that off-the-rails meeting, and you and I were having the live conversation when it happened there at the White House between the United States and the United States. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=203.0s)]
*  I was in the White House between President Donald Trump and the vice president and members of his cabinet and Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Zelensky during that meeting said, listen, Russia continues breaking the agreements that they have made for years. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=215.0s)]
*  Why should we trust them that striking a deal can really maintain any sort of peace? We hear a lot about concessions that Ukraine may have to make, but I'm not hearing a lot about concessions Russia would have to make. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=230.0s)]
*  I mean, they're the ones who invaded Crimea and annexed it. What are you hearing on that front? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=242.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. They're the ones that started all of this. I mean, going back, of course, to 2014, the illegal annexation of Crimea. I have the feeling, very strong feeling, and I don't think I'm alone with this. I think most Ukrainians would agree with me is that they can't be trusted to honor any agreement. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=246.0s)]
*  That is why Ukrainians will tell you. And that's why in these talks, this will be repeated again and again, why security guarantees backed by the U.S. Right now, the world's biggest superpower are so important because if Russia does violate any ceasefire or peace agreement, the security guarantor, in theory, nothing is taken for we can take for granted these days, has to come in and defend Ukraine. That could mean boots on the ground. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=263.0s)]
*  But the trust, again, going back to this, the trust in the United States as a effective interlocutor, I think is going down by the day. It seems that this Trump peace train is nearing the end of its tracks for the Ukrainians. And maybe they do need to go to Saudi Arabia or Turkey, Qatar or whoever to pick things up because I have this gut feeling it's not going a good way for the Ukrainians. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=291.0s)]
*  So for our viewers benefit, you're in Moldova, which is right below Ukraine. What is the feeling there as the talks continue about ending this war? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah, I've talked to a lot of people since arriving here a couple of days ago and immense anxiety because it's not only a frontier country with not much air power or military power to speak of. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=332.0s)]
*  And also it has that sliver of pro-Russian separatists on their borders. And they've always felt that since the falling apart of the Soviet Union that they would end up in Mr. Putin's crosshair. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=346.0s)]
*  So I've been saying the past few days, my big worry without any solid red lines enforced by the United States, this is the perfect time for Mr. Putin to strike. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=361.0s)]
*  It's not it's it could be that he's looking at expanding his territorial gains further along the Black Sea coast towards Mikhailov, Odessa, possibly up to the border with Moldova and perhaps beyond. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=370.0s)]
*  He would like nothing more than to link the Russian mainland with Transnistria consuming all of Odessa and Mikhailov and effectively making Ukraine a landlocked nation. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=384.0s)]
*  And when you see the map there, you can see why so many other European nations are also invested in these conversations. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=395.0s)]
*  And you can also see why President Donald Trump, from his perspective, at least, says they need to boost their own contributions for their own defense. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=403.0s)]
*  You can see both sides of that argument right there on that map. It's an important map. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=411.0s)]
*  Michael Voskuk, as always, thank you so much for having a conversation with us on CBS News 24 seven. Let's do it again sometime. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=415.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. My pleasure. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N6g8GAr3As&t=422.0s)]
