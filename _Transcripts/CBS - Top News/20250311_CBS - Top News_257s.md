# What we know about Ukraine willing to accept a 30-day ceasefire with Russia
**CBS - Top News:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc)
*  We continue to follow breaking news out of Saudi Arabia where U.S. and Ukrainian officials have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=0.0s)]
*  reached a series of agreements about the Russia-Ukraine war and that includes Ukraine saying it would [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=4.16s)]
*  accept a U.S. proposal calling for an immediate 30-day ceasefire with Russia. CBS News senior [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  foreign correspondent Holly Williams has more. Well the headlines from this joint statement [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=14.32s)]
*  coming out of Saudi Arabia is that Ukraine has agreed to a U.S. proposal to implement a 30-day [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=19.12s)]
*  interim ceasefire though of course that will require Russia's agreement as well. More [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=26.16s)]
*  immediately the U.S. has agreed to immediately lift the pause on intelligence sharing and the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=31.28s)]
*  delivery of military aid to Ukraine. Now that was suspended after an explosive disastrous [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=37.84s)]
*  meeting recently in Washington between President Vladimir Zelensky of Ukraine and President Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=43.92s)]
*  This meeting was clearly aimed at mending fences, at finding common ground and I think the Ukrainians [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  will be pretty pleased with that result. Remember from Ukraine's perspective in recent weeks [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=55.52s)]
*  the U.S. has gone from being its most important ally, one of its staunchest allies committing over [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=60.24s)]
*  a hundred billion dollars in aid during three years of war to suspending the delivery of military [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=66.08s)]
*  aid. President Trump calling this country's elected president a dictator and then giving [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=71.76s)]
*  him a very public dressing down at the White House. Ahead of these talks President Zelensky [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=77.04s)]
*  stressed that Ukraine has wanted peace from the very first second of this war but at the same time [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=82.72s)]
*  Ukraine clearly does not want to be pressured into a ceasefire deal that rewards Vladimir Putin with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=89.28s)]
*  territory, Ukrainian territory and leaves the door open to him invading once again in future because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=95.52s)]
*  that has happened before in this country. As part of any long-term ceasefire deal it's clear that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=101.92s)]
*  Ukraine still very much wants security guarantees including from the United States to make sure that [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=108.24s)]
*  Vladimir Putin thinks twice. Back to you. Holly Williams, thank you. I want to bring in Mark [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=115.19999999999999s)]
*  Kansian. He's a senior advisor with the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  and International Studies. Mark, do we know yet what this 30-day ceasefire proposal looks like [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=125.52s)]
*  or do terms still need to be hammered out? Well terms need to be hammered out for every element [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  of this announcement including the 30-day ceasefire but it the major elements are contained in that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=136.64s)]
*  phrase. In other words it's a in-place ceasefire. It will go for 30 days. It could be extended [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=143.04s)]
*  and could be extended for an extended period of time depending on how long negotiations go on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=149.2s)]
*  So the U.S. says it will resume sharing intel with Ukraine. Do you think there's a risk they could pull [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=157.04s)]
*  it again? I think that that's always a risk but this is a very good sign for Ukraine. That is that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=161.68s)]
*  it has convinced the United States that it's willing to participate in negotiations. The [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=170.8s)]
*  United States has resumed this support so Ukraine can continue its resistance. The future is uncertain [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=176.08s)]
*  but the ball is now in Russia's court and if Russia does not make some concessions they are the ones [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=183.84s)]
*  who will likely feel Trump's wrath. So Trump, President Trump's envoy Steve [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=189.52s)]
*  Wittkopf has headed to Russia this week. Obviously there's a lot that needs to be ironed out with [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=195.12s)]
*  Russia. How do you feel Russia is going to take this development and what do you think they're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=199.84s)]
*  going to ask for in return? It's key what Russia responds with. So far Russia has not indicated any [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  interest in making concessions. They felt that they were winning the war. They felt that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=215.12s)]
*  President Trump had now essentially backed their side. They had become even more expansive in their [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=221.6s)]
*  demands. So they will need to reevaluate their position. Trump will need to get them to do that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=228.56s)]
*  and to make some concessions, for example acknowledging the validity of Ukraine as a state [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=234.88s)]
*  in order for these talks to be successful. Well Mark Kansian, clearly still a lot to be discussed [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=242.16s)]
*  but some positive movements potentially toward a peace deal today. Thank you for joining us on this news. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pz4rXFLYcc&t=248.96s)]
