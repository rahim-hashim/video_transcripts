# Judge calls Justice Department filing "woefully insufficient" in deportation case
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA)
*  A new deadline is set for later this morning in the ongoing battle between the Justice Department and a federal judge over the deportation flights of hundreds of Venezuelan nationals. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=0.0s)]
*  Judge James Boasberg asked the DOJ to provide more details on the deportation flights by noon yesterday. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=10.0s)]
*  Now, the agency did submit a court filing, but after the deadline, the judge says much of the information in that filing was already known and he called it woefully insufficient. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=17.0s)]
*  The White House Deputy Chief of Staff says the Supreme Court needs to rein in judges blocking the Trump agenda. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=27.0s)]
*  It is unacceptable. It is in fact offensive to and an insult to democracy to keep in place a system where district court judges can order men back into women's prisons, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=34.0s)]
*  can order diversity, equity and inclusion back into the federal government, can order Secretary Rubio to resume foreign aid to unfriendly regimes, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=46.0s)]
*  can order Secretary Noem to return terrorist aliens back to our country and then we have to individually go through months and months and months of process just to get back to where we started. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=54.0s)]
*  That is completely unacceptable. CBS News legal reporter Katrina Kaufman joins me here in Studio 57 to talk more about what really is a legal tug of war. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=64.0s)]
*  Katrina, good morning to you. We heard from Stephen Miller there. He says it's unacceptable. Help us understand the president's position on this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=73.0s)]
*  The president is asking the Supreme Court to stop these nationwide injunctions. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=81.0s)]
*  So, Errol, he doesn't want district courts to be able to implement these bans on the entire country. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=86.0s)]
*  But I have to say there is a real irony here because during the Biden administration, this is something that conservatives were doing. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=92.0s)]
*  In particular, they were going and Trump also is accusing lawyers of judge shopping. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=99.0s)]
*  But during the Biden administration, there were conservative lawyers who were going to these certain districts in Texas, where, for example, there is one judge in Amarillo, Texas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=104.0s)]
*  His name is Matthew Kazmeric. That's where they took the Mefa Pristone case, which led to a nationwide ban of Mefa Pristone. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=114.0s)]
*  So there is a real irony here. And meantime, on this actual battle, what are we learning about who precisely was on these deportation flights? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=122.0s)]
*  The administration hasn't given specifics. So we have managed to obtain a list of the people who are on that flight, Errol, and we're starting to learn more information about them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=133.0s)]
*  So one was a professional soccer player in Venezuela. We've learned with no criminal record. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=142.0s)]
*  And his attorney says he was identified because of a tattoo he had. But really, it's not gang related. It was honoring the Real Madrid soccer team. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=149.0s)]
*  He's also someone who had applied for asylum to escape political persecution here, and he was supposed to have a court date coming up in April. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=159.0s)]
*  Sounds really unusual. So what's the next step in this case? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=167.0s)]
*  So as you were saying, they were supposed to file yesterday answering the judge's questions. They've yet again sort of kicked this can down the road. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=172.0s)]
*  The judge is clearly having his patience worn thin now, Errol. So by this morning, also he was frustrated because the person who attested to these cabinet level decisions about whether or not they're going to try to invoke the state's secret privilege was someone from ICE, which he said was just not appropriate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=182.0s)]
*  So they have to explain that. And he has given them until next week to let him know if they're going to invoke the state secret's privilege as well. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=201.0s)]
*  So I'd expect within the next week, we'll have a better sense of where this is going to go. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=210.0s)]
*  Wow. Far from over. Katrina Kaufman, great to see you. Thanks for that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=215.0s)]
*  Thank you, Errol. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iM_GEthhxA&t=218.0s)]
