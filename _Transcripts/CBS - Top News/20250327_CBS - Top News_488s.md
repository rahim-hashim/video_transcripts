# Hegseth reacts to Atlantic releasing his Signal texts to Trump team detailing Yemen bombing
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To)
*  The Trump administration is remaining defiant this morning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=0.0s)]
*  standing by its claim there was nothing classified [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=3.88s)]
*  in a group chat about US military operations in Yemen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=7.2s)]
*  Now, the Atlantic and the journalists [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=11.52s)]
*  mistakenly added to the chain on a commercial messaging app [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=13.08s)]
*  has now released the entire chat, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=15.8s)]
*  including the detailed timeline sent [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  just before the attack began. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=20.38s)]
*  Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=22.56s)]
*  maintains he was just doing his job. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  My job, as it's set atop of that, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=27.72s)]
*  everybody's seen it now, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=30.44s)]
*  team update is to provide updates in real time. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=31.72s)]
*  General updates in real time, keep everybody informed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=36.68s)]
*  That's what I did. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=40.16s)]
*  That's my job. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=41.96s)]
*  We have team coverage for you on this morning [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=44.04s)]
*  across Washington. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=46.64s)]
*  Natalie Brand is tracking the White House's response [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=47.68s)]
*  and Nicole Killian is tracking lawmakers on the Hill. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=50.36s)]
*  But let's begin with Charlie Dagata at the Pentagon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Charlie, good morning to you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  The Secretary's statement seems to echo [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=58.64s)]
*  what we heard from the Pentagon yesterday, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=59.96s)]
*  but you wonder, isn't there another way [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=62.68s)]
*  for a Defense Secretary to communicate [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=64.52s)]
*  operational updates to his team? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=66.82s)]
*  What are you hearing from your sources? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=68.6s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Errol, when you hear him say [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=71.04s)]
*  he was doing his job, yes, he was doing his job. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=73.24s)]
*  He was communicating with the principals, as we call them, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=75.68s)]
*  the people that should be involved [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=79.84s)]
*  in that kind of conversation. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=81.32s)]
*  It was how he was doing his job [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=82.64s)]
*  that is under question here at the Pentagon. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=84.48s)]
*  This is a building of 27,000 people [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  who are all involved in that kind of engagement, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=91.67999999999999s)]
*  those kind of operations. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=95.44s)]
*  And to the person, I was gonna say to the man, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=96.8s)]
*  to the person, nobody has experienced [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=100.39999999999999s)]
*  the kind of decimation of information [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  that we have seen in the past 10 days. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  You know, this battle has been going on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=111.75999999999999s)]
*  a week from, a week ago Saturday. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=114.36s)]
*  And we kind of knew, like, as journalists, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  we kind of get the heads up that there might be [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=120.12s)]
*  military operations going on, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  but we never get that kind of granular detail, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=124.2s)]
*  not before the operation, certainly not during the operation, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=126.7s)]
*  but even after the operation, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=131.74s)]
*  in terms of target acquisition, in terms of pacing, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=133.68s)]
*  how you're going to do it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=138.0s)]
*  And what shocked me and shocked others in this building [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=139.4s)]
*  was the TikTok. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=143.08s)]
*  We knew from that chat group on Signal, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=144.48s)]
*  on an unclassified or unsecured channel, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=148.52s)]
*  exactly when those F-18s took off, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=152.12s)]
*  exactly what they were targeting, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=154.48s)]
*  exactly where they would be at what time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=156.28s)]
*  More than that, the Tomahawk cruise missiles, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=158.92s)]
*  this was in the chat, the drones that were taking off. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=162.2s)]
*  The Houthis aren't entirely capable as an adversary, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=167.2s)]
*  if we compare them to, say, Iran or Russia or China, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=172.67999999999998s)]
*  but they still would have been capable enough to know, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=176.72s)]
*  if I got a 30 minutes heads up, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=178.56s)]
*  they would have been able to prepare in some way. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=181.22s)]
*  They would have been able to either get assets [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  out of the area, get targets out of the area, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=185.51999999999998s)]
*  and in some cases try to fire back. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=188.35999999999999s)]
*  And they have been capable of firing back [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=190.32s)]
*  at high-flying drones. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  They certainly would have tried to take out an F-18. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=194.2s)]
*  So this is where the rubber, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=196.83999999999997s)]
*  meets the road, because he would argue, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=202.28s)]
*  as he can, Defense Secretary Hegseth, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  that this is unclassified information [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=209.76s)]
*  or declassified information, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=211.92s)]
*  because he is a decider to make it unclassified [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  or declassified. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  However, to get this information out there on a channel, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=221.44s)]
*  a half hour or even in some cases two hours [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=225.72s)]
*  before these strikes are gonna take place, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=229.04s)]
*  that is absolutely an infringement on national security. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=231.12s)]
*  Yeah, and so many people in the military have said, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=234.36s)]
*  if they were found to have done the same thing, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=236.72s)]
*  they would have been reprimanded or lose their job. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=240.08s)]
*  Errol, almost everybody would. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=243.56s)]
*  I mean, almost everybody would. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=245.44s)]
*  If you were a soldier, if you were a sailor, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=247.08s)]
*  if you were Intel, if you had given, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=249.36s)]
*  we use signal to speak to or to contact individuals. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=252.12s)]
*  First of all, I would never ask anything [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=257.72s)]
*  that would have to do with operational security, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=259.8s)]
*  and they would never give it to me. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  Anything close to that, yeah, they'd be out of a job. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=264.72s)]
*  Very important point, Charlie Dagata, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=267.8s)]
*  at the Pentagon for us this morning. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Charlie, thanks as always. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=270.76s)]
*  Let's cross over to CBS News correspondent, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=272.32s)]
*  Natalie Brand, tracking reaction from the White House. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=274.12s)]
*  Natalie, good morning to you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=277.36s)]
*  We heard President Trump speak about this controversy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  over signal yesterday and seemed to brush it off. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=281.12s)]
*  Help us understand his position. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=284.44s)]
*  Yeah, the White House continues [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=287.0s)]
*  to try to downplay this incident. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=288.96s)]
*  The president yesterday calling this, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=291.72s)]
*  calling the media coverage of it a quote, witch hunt. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=294.48s)]
*  But notably, President Trump, when asked by reporters, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=297.8s)]
*  also said he does not oppose an inspector general's report [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=301.28s)]
*  into what happened, saying he wants to learn [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=306.28s)]
*  whether there was a mistake or a larger issue [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=308.72s)]
*  with signal, the messaging app that was used. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=311.12s)]
*  And as for the latest Atlantic article published yesterday, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  which gave more details about what defense secretary [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=319.52000000000004s)]
*  Hegseth posted regarding the exact timeline assets [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=323.16s)]
*  used in this military operation, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=327.68s)]
*  the president was asked whether he still thinks [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  that information that was shared was not classified. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=333.0s)]
*  Here's what he had to say. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, that's what I've heard. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=338.48s)]
*  I don't know, I'm not sure. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=339.48s)]
*  You have to ask the various people involved. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=340.44s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=342.68s)]
*  I can only tell you this, you know, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=344.47999999999996s)]
*  you don't want to talk about it. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  The Houthis have been horrible to the world [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=348.08s)]
*  of what they've done, killed a lot of people. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=352.68s)]
*  They have been hit harder than they've ever been hit. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=354.88s)]
*  And they want us to stop so badly. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=357.68s)]
*  And they've got to stop. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=360.44s)]
*  Again, the president and White House trying to play up [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=363.68s)]
*  the success of the strike, saying, you know, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=366.96s)]
*  nothing happened. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=370.08s)]
*  He also yesterday defended defense secretary Hegseth, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=372.04s)]
*  saying he's doing a great job. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=375.76s)]
*  But when asked whether he will ask Hegseth to review [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=377.88s)]
*  whether the information shared should have been classified, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=381.48s)]
*  he said, he said, yes, he would do that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=384.84s)]
*  Errol. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=387.72s)]
*  All right, Natalie Brand with the latest [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=388.56s)]
*  from the White House. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=389.76s)]
*  Let's jump over to CBS News congressional correspondent, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=390.88s)]
*  Nicole Killian on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=393.28s)]
*  Nicole, good morning to you. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=394.84s)]
*  In what was one of the most significant developments [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=396.52s)]
*  yesterday, you had the Republican chairman [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=399.16s)]
*  of the Senate Armed Services Committee, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  that's Roger Wicker, call for an independent review [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=403.20000000000005s)]
*  of this security lapse. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=406.48s)]
*  Help us understand why that's so relevant. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=408.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, just to be clear, it's obviously an attempt [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=411.44s)]
*  to get more information about what happened. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=414.8s)]
*  And he is asking for an expedited inspector general review. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  So not necessarily independent from the standpoint [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=423.36s)]
*  of going to an outside entity, but hoping that, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=425.8s)]
*  for instance, the Pentagon may be able to expedite [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=428.20000000000005s)]
*  watchdog review of this incident, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=431.16s)]
*  given the involvement of the secretary of state [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=433.48s)]
*  and obviously his jurisdiction [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  as the Senate Armed Services Committee chair. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=437.56s)]
*  So that is the hope they're also seeking to get [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=440.08s)]
*  a classified briefing from administration officials. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=442.8s)]
*  And of course, they would like to get their hands [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=445.48s)]
*  on more information with respect to this chat, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=447.32s)]
*  including potentially the chat itself. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=450.52s)]
*  So that is what Roger Wicker and his counterpart, Jack Reed, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=452.8s)]
*  on the Senate Armed Services Committee are pursuing. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=455.88s)]
*  I would note, though, there are other congressional members [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=458.12s)]
*  who are calling for investigations as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  Senator Coons of Delaware, among the latest, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=463.76s)]
*  who also call for an IG review of this incident. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=467.24s)]
*  There's also a lot of concern about whether records [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=471.32s)]
*  were preserved from this incident [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=473.76s)]
*  or will be preserved from this incident. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=475.59999999999997s)]
*  So there are many calls on all sides [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  for a more extended review of what went wrong. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=480.32s)]
*  Yeah, the pressure certainly is on. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=484.64s)]
*  Nicole, thank you very much. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn4syFbw8To&t=486.36s)]
