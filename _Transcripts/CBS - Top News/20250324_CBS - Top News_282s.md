# Schumer, Johnson react to top Trump officials texting journalist about bombing Yemen
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls)
*  As we've been reporting, top U.S. officials accidentally leaked sensitive information [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=0.0s)]
*  in a group chat with an Atlantic editor. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=4.38s)]
*  CBS News congressional correspondent Nicole Killian joins us now for more on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  So Nicole, we're going to talk about that in a second. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=11.88s)]
*  Chuck Schumer and actually House Majority Leader Mike Johnson weighed in on this earlier. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=14.08s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=18.44s)]
*  If these detailed exchanges about coordinating military operations fell into the hands of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=21.32s)]
*  It could get people killed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=27.36s)]
*  This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, the damage it created, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=30.08s)]
*  and how we can avoid it in the future. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=40.12s)]
*  Should Mike Walton and Sen. Pete Discipline? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=42.36s)]
*  No, no. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  How are other lawmakers reacting? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=47.84s)]
*  Well, you know, shortly after Speaker Mike Johnson weighed in there saying that he felt [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=49.56s)]
*  that this was just a mistake and that it didn't ultimately compromise safety in his [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=55.6s)]
*  view that the mission ended up being successful. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=61.84s)]
*  I did ask House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries if he felt that a congressional investigation [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=64.44s)]
*  should be launched. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=71.2s)]
*  Take a listen to his response. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=72.32s)]
*  It should absolutely be a congressional investigation so that we can understand what happened, why [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=75.88s)]
*  Why did it happen and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=81.68s)]
*  happening again? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  This is reckless, irresponsible and dangerous. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=91.0s)]
*  So that is what we are hearing writ large from a number of congressional Democrats who do [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=99.68s)]
*  feel that this matter should be probed further, who believe this was irresponsible on the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=103.84s)]
*  part of the Trump Cabinet officials who were involved in this signal chat. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=110.24s)]
*  But there are some congressional Republicans as well who are expressing concern, particularly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  in the Senate, saying that they do want to look further into what happened. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=120.28s)]
*  I would note that there is a Senate hearing tomorrow that is held pretty routinely here [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=124.44s)]
*  that deals with the issue of worldwide threats. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=130.84s)]
*  But there will be a number of Intel leaders here on Capitol Hill, including DNI Director [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=133.6s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard, who was involved in that signal chat, as well as the head of the FBI, Cash [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=138.52s)]
*  Patel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=143.76s)]
*  So it's possible this issue could be raised in tomorrow's hearing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=144.76s)]
*  Nicole, the speaker was also asked about President Trump's calls and those of his allies to impeach [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=148.48s)]
*  federal judges who oppose him. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=153.2s)]
*  What did he say? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=154.86s)]
*  Well, he did say that this is an issue that House Republicans want to look into further, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=156.86s)]
*  but he does have to walk a pretty fine line here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=162.28s)]
*  There are some members of the House Republican Conference who do want to impeach judges, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  specifically that Judge Boesberg, who has been involved in that very contentious court [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=170.64s)]
*  fight surrounding the president's actions with respect to those deportation flights. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  That is a resolution on the part of Congressman Gill. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=182.6s)]
*  But right now it has some co-sponsors, but unclear whether or not it will garner widespread [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=186.35999999999999s)]
*  support. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=192.39999999999998s)]
*  What the speaker seems to be signaling is that perhaps there might be a different course [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=193.84s)]
*  of action that House Republicans can take more specifically, whether that is holding [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=199.8s)]
*  congressional hearings on the matter, maybe looking at the issue of federal or national [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=204.28s)]
*  injunctions, which is something that some congressional Republicans have raised concerns [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=209.72s)]
*  about versus going forward with impeachment. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=213.68s)]
*  I would also flag that Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also weighed in on this topic, saying [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=216.12s)]
*  that impeachment simply isn't happening. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=220.8s)]
*  I got to be quick with you, but before we go, we know that Schumer is under a lot of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=223.32s)]
*  pressure right now from members within his own party after he advanced that spending [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=226.88s)]
*  bill that avoided a government shutdown. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=230.44s)]
*  What is he saying? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=232.6s)]
*  Well, he says he is still in the fight here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=233.6s)]
*  He understands the criticism that he has received because he feels that he really didn't have [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=237.84s)]
*  a great option in terms of backing this GOP spending bill or opting for a shutdown. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=243.68s)]
*  He felt a shutdown would be worse. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=248.52s)]
*  So he knew that that decision could raise some concern among some of his members, particularly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=250.44000000000003s)]
*  given that House Democrats were pretty universally opposed with the exception of one member. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=255.12s)]
*  So from that standpoint, he knew that he would get some heat for this, but he insists that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=260.76s)]
*  he is not going anywhere in terms of leadership, despite some constituents and others expressing [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=265.56s)]
*  concerns about the path forward. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=271.56s)]
*  But he says that he intends to remain minority leader and doesn't have any plans to go anywhere [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  anytime soon. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=278.92s)]
*  Nicole Killian, thank you so much. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf7xdPN4Yls&t=279.92s)]
