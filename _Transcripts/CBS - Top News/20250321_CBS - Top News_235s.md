# Another deadline passes for DOJ to give judge details on deportation flights
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI)
*  A new deadline for the Department of Justice to provide a federal judge with information [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=0.0s)]
*  about last weekend's deportation flights has come and gone. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=4.68s)]
*  The flights carried hundreds of Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=8.76s)]
*  The Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport 137 of them. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=11.9s)]
*  But a federal court judge says the flights violated a temporary restraining order demanding [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=18.3s)]
*  the flights return to the U.S. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  The DOJ handed a late court filing to Judge James Boasberg yesterday. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=24.6s)]
*  The judge called it woefully insufficient. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=30.28s)]
*  He demanded more information be delivered this morning ahead of a hearing later this [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=33.04s)]
*  afternoon. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=37.36s)]
*  CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland has more details from Washington. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=38.36s)]
*  So Scott, again, just for our audience to understand, what happened and what can the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=44.24s)]
*  judge do in order to hold whoever was responsible for this deportation accountable? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=50.28s)]
*  Unequivocally, Vlad, this is a potentially landmark standoff that's unfolding before [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=57.32s)]
*  our eyes. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=62.68s)]
*  The Department of Justice didn't miss a deadline from this federal judge. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=63.68s)]
*  They've missed a series of deadlines day after day from this judge. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  And if you don't like a judge's order, you can't simply disobey it or disregard it, you [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=71.6s)]
*  appeal it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  That's not quite what's happening in this case. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=78.44s)]
*  So you have this showdown this afternoon, midday in Washington, where the judge has [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=80.24s)]
*  called at least some members of the Department of Justice to appear before him to answer [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=86.08s)]
*  some questions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=89.96s)]
*  Now, he has had a series of questions about those deportations last Saturday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=90.96s)]
*  When did the planes take off? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=95.08s)]
*  When did they clear U.S. airspace? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=96.36s)]
*  When did they land? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=98.18s)]
*  He hasn't gotten answers to those questions. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=99.18s)]
*  He's gotten arguments from the Department of Justice why they don't believe they should [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=101.32s)]
*  answer those questions. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=105.02s)]
*  The chief judge, James Boesberg, longtime figure in the Washington, D.C. federal courthouse, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=106.64s)]
*  not a household name, but in the legal circles, he is a famous name. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=112.8s)]
*  And he recognizes the significance of what's happening here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=117.52s)]
*  This is the front line of a standoff between the administration and the federal courts. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=120.98s)]
*  And we are going to see how he carries it this afternoon at the next hearing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=125.94s)]
*  We were talking about this earlier, Scott, on the set of CBS Mornings between us. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=130.8s)]
*  In years past, for example, governors have rejected orders from the federal government. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=135.4s)]
*  Most famously during the segregation fights of the 1960s, the president of the United [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=142.52s)]
*  States was able to order National Guard troops to allow students to enter schools. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=146.32s)]
*  But in this case, this is the federal government rejecting a justice's order. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=152.44s)]
*  And so the question becomes, what is that mechanism? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=158.38s)]
*  In the case of the 1950s and 60s, the president could do something here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=161.92s)]
*  It is the president who's rejecting these orders. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  And I don't want to understate the significance of these deportations of 200-plus, then as [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=169.56s)]
*  well in nationals, a particularly important moment in itself. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=173.88s)]
*  But this becomes so much bigger and wider than just that issue. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  This is a fundamental face-off between two branches of government that has the potential, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=181.44s)]
*  the potential to become destabilized. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=186.72s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen next. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=189.48s)]
*  The judge kind of set the table last night in the court docket for a possible contempt [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=191.64s)]
*  finding against somebody inside the Department of Justice. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  But that is a provocative notion, no matter what's been happening in this case, Vlad, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  because you know who signed their name to these filings for the Department of Justice? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=203.39999999999998s)]
*  The U.S. attorney general herself, the deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, the number [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  three official, Emile Bov√©, and the chief of staff for the Department of Justice. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=211.48s)]
*  These are not low-ranking line prosecutors. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  This is the Department of Justice. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=218.89999999999998s)]
*  It's not clear what happens next. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=221.28s)]
*  And that's why this is such a fascinating and potentially important hearing today. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=223.4s)]
*  It's the first step into finding out what's next. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=227.48000000000002s)]
*  All right, Scott McFarland for us, reported from Washington. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=230.24s)]
*  Scott, thank you very much. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJeIb3LlZgI&t=233.4s)]
