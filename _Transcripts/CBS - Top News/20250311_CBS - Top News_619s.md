# Latest news on Trump's trade war with Canada, shock in stock markets
**CBS - Top News:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU)
*  Welcome in to CBS News 24-7. I'm Elizabeth Cook. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's take a live look at the White House right now where we are expecting Press Secretary Caroline Levin to take the podium any moment now and give us an update. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=3.5s)]
*  And right now, high-stakes talks are happening between the U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, with the U.S. looking to strike a deal to end the war with Russia. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=11.5s)]
*  And time is running out to fund the U.S. government. Republicans are facing a crucial test of unity in a vote to avoid a partial government shutdown. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=22.5s)]
*  And the economy has been top of mind for so many Americans. Let's take a live look at the markets right now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=33.0s)]
*  The Dow again on a steady decline since the president announced new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=38.0s)]
*  Trump says those taxes will go into effect tomorrow. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=46.0s)]
*  Now, those new tariffs come just one day after Canada tacked on a 25% surcharge to electrify supplies to New York, Michigan, and Minnesota. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=49.5s)]
*  An estimated 1.5 million Americans will be impacted by those increases. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=62.5s)]
*  China also announced its own retaliatory tariffs yesterday. Let's take a look at some of the food being taxed here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=67.5s)]
*  Chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton slapped with a 15% tariff. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=74.0s)]
*  Dairy, fruits, veggies, and meat also hit with a 10% tariff. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=79.5s)]
*  And today marks the second day of sinking stocks out of concern over President Trump's aggressive trade policies. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=84.5s)]
*  The seven most profitable tech companies took the biggest hits yesterday. That includes Tesla. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=91.5s)]
*  Elon Musk's company dropped over 15%. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=96.5s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady for more on all this. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=99.5s)]
*  Kelly, thanks so much for being with us. How concerned should we be about this unstable market right now? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=103.5s)]
*  I know it is really scary to watch. I completely understand. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=111.5s)]
*  And I mean, look, if you're if you are going to check your 401k, I don't want to invalidate your feelings because I know that that is very scary. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=115.5s)]
*  But to put this into context, I'll sort of give you two reasons to be hopeful and maybe one reason that this could spell some trouble to come. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=123.5s)]
*  So the first is that if you look back at what happened in 2008, right, really big recession, the market was far more down and for far longer. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=131.5s)]
*  We are by no means at that point whatsoever. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=143.5s)]
*  So that's sort of one thing to keep in mind and just sort of give yourself a gut check of, OK, it has definitely been worse before. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=147.5s)]
*  We are not at that point. The second thing is, is we have seen a run up the last few months in the market where people were trading on hopes and expectations of what the Trump administration would be. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=153.5s)]
*  And in fact, if you go back the last couple of years, a lot of analysts, specifically the tech stocks, the magnificent set of them, the Nvidia's, the Apple's, those big tech giants. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=165.5s)]
*  A lot of people were saying they were overvalued. They were a term we like to call overbought in investing. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=175.5s)]
*  And so some people are saying, well, we were always going to come back to reality at some point and really base that value and the stock price more on performance rather than hopes and dreams. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=181.5s)]
*  And so we could see some of that happening here. And it was just this chaos around tariffs being the catalyst for it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=190.5s)]
*  The one area where I say, OK, there might be some worry to come is that we are seeing a dip in consumer spending. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=198.5s)]
*  We are seeing a dip in consumer confidence. We are seeing retailers come out one after another and say, hey, we are not going to be making as much this year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=203.5s)]
*  A number of airlines came out this morning, Liz, and said the same thing that they're seeing demand weaken. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=211.5s)]
*  So if all of this anxiety in watching the market does prompt consumers to go spend less, well, then that could actually precipitate that recession, that R-word that has been thrown around a bit. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=216.5s)]
*  Yeah, the R-word is definitely looming today, Kelly. But how do these tariffs have a direct impact on consumers, their day to day? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=229.5s)]
*  OK, so when a company imports aluminum and steel and then sells it maybe to the person building your home, well, they're going to probably pass at least some of that on to you. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=239.5s)]
*  So industries that are going to really feel the pain from these tariffs are home building cars. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=251.5s)]
*  I mean, what's a big component going into your vehicle? I don't care what company you're buying it from. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=257.5s)]
*  And then also some other things like aluminum cans. I mean, what is your favorite soda or maybe your beer come in, right? It's aluminum. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=263.5s)]
*  So consumers will likely feel a price increase from that and just depends on how much the supplier is going to pass along down the supply chain. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=270.5s)]
*  The other thing is a lot of businesses are going to see increased costs and there's such a focus on bringing manufacturing here to the U.S. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=280.5s)]
*  Manufacturers have to use aluminum and steel. And in fact, I talked to one Liz recently, so that's going to kill him. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=289.5s)]
*  He's so excited about the boom in manufacturing he's expecting. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=296.5s)]
*  But those increased costs on aluminum and steel with those tariffs could really hurt his bottom line. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=299.5s)]
*  I want to ask you, Kelly, about another social media post from the from the president last night. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=305.5s)]
*  He says that he's going to buy a brand new Tesla today as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=310.5s)]
*  All right. Buying a car in the large scheme of things is sort of a small drop in the bucket. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=318.5s)]
*  But could this be considered manipulating the market? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=322.5s)]
*  Well, look, I think you're going to find some critics who might go so far as to say that from where I'm standing. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=327.5s)]
*  It is that would be a very, very, very big stretch. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=334.5s)]
*  And in fact, I will read you the SEC's definition of market manipulation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=337.5s)]
*  It is intentional conduct designed to deceive investors by controlling or artificially affecting the market for a security or, in other words, a stock. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=342.5s)]
*  What the president is doing here would not qualify under that definition. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=353.5s)]
*  So, like I said, I think you might see some critics and maybe some other car companies saying, hey, you know, I'd love for you to say that about my brand. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=358.5s)]
*  But I don't think that this could be considered market manipulation with just this one pledge to buy a car. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=365.5s)]
*  All right, Kelly O'Grady, thanks so much for that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=372.5s)]
*  All right, let's take you now to the White House for CBS News reporter Olivia Rinaldi joins us with more on these tariffs. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=375.5s)]
*  Olivia, we understand the Ontario premier Doug Ford and Trump have been exchanging these verbal blows this morning about these surcharges. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=381.5s)]
*  Can you walk us through what they're saying? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=389.5s)]
*  Yeah, Liz, good morning. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=393.5s)]
*  This trade war is deepening and it is getting uglier between the two countries. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=395.5s)]
*  As Kelly just mentioned, there is now a larger tariff on steel and aluminum coming into the US. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=400.5s)]
*  Trump just announcing hours ago that that is jumping from 25 percent to 50 percent and it's going into effect tomorrow. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=406.5s)]
*  Now, this is in response to a tariff on electricity that the Ontario province is putting on to US products to or not US products, but rather Canadian products that get imported into the US as a result of these increasing tariffs. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=413.5s)]
*  And I do want to point out that Canada is a top supplier of steel to the US. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=427.5s)]
*  Trump is trying to hit them where it hurts, essentially. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=432.5s)]
*  And he called out in a true social post saying, why would our country ever allow another country to supply us with electricity, even for a small area? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=434.5s)]
*  Who made these decisions and why? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=442.5s)]
*  He went on to say, can you imagine Canada stooping so low to use electricity so that it affects the life of innocent people? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=444.5s)]
*  And as a bargaining chip and a threat, he went on to say that they will pay a financial price for this so big that it will be read in the history books for many years to come. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=451.5s)]
*  We should also note that he later said he would declare a national emergency on electricity for areas like Minnesota, Michigan and New York that really depend on Ontario for their electrical supplies. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=461.5s)]
*  In response to that, Doug Ford, who's the premier of Ontario, went on MSNBC and CNBC responding directly to these threats from the president, saying, if we go, this is what he said, I'm quoting him. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=473.5s)]
*  He said, if we go into recession, it's self-made by one person. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=487.5s)]
*  It's called President Trump's recession. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=491.5s)]
*  He went on to say it shouldn't be this way. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=493.5s)]
*  We should be booming both countries. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=495.5s)]
*  He railed against Trump and the chaos. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=498.5s)]
*  Trump called Canada a tariff abuser. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=500.5s)]
*  So not only are we dealing with an economic tit for tat, but clearly these leaders going back and forth at each other over these rising tariffs. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=503.5s)]
*  All of this to say, though, this is something that gets passed down to the consumer. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=511.5s)]
*  You heard Kelly talking about that there. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=515.5s)]
*  It affects American pocketbooks. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=517.5s)]
*  It affects how people spend on their energy bills, particularly in those states that we mentioned that they're going to see higher energy prices. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=519.5s)]
*  This has a real cost to pay. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=527.5s)]
*  It's not just words. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=529.5s)]
*  And I think that's important to note as we go through all of this deepening tariff war. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=531.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=535.5s)]
*  And we're seeing the reaction on Wall Street, Olivia. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=536.5s)]
*  We also understand major CEOs are sitting down with Donald Trump later on today. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=538.5s)]
*  A lot of money is on the line here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=542.5s)]
*  What are you going to be watching for? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=544.5s)]
*  Yeah, Trump is actually going to speak to the business roundtable here in Washington, D.C. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=547.5s)]
*  It's at their quarterly meeting. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=551.5s)]
*  And this is a gathering of the top 100 CEOs in the country. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=553.5s)]
*  And these are all people who lost a lot of money yesterday during that market sell off. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=557.5s)]
*  I should also know that the business roundtable specifically said to the White House that they are against this trade war. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=562.5s)]
*  They're looking forward to Trump's tax cuts and those being solidified into law. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=571.5s)]
*  That would take an act of Congress. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=575.5s)]
*  But on this tariff war, this trade war that he is starting, they have asked him to stop it. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=577.5s)]
*  They said that this is going to have a serious economic impact. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=582.5s)]
*  They said that the White House and Congress should preserve the benefits of the USMCA deal that they endorsed years ago when Trump made it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=586.5s)]
*  So he'll be speaking to them later today. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=593.5s)]
*  I should note that those remarks will be covered by the press. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=595.5s)]
*  So we should get a readout on specifically what Trump said to these CEOs. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=599.5s)]
*  But he'll be talking with the heads of Apple, JP Morgan, Chase, Wal-Mart. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=603.5s)]
*  They'll all be in the room and they all lost a lot of money yesterday. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=607.5s)]
*  And some of those people were at his inauguration. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=610.5s)]
*  So it'll be interesting to see what comes out of that meeting. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=613.5s)]
*  Olivia Rinaldi from Washington. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=615.5s)]
*  Thank you so much, Olivia. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94sGllgc0nU&t=616.5s)]
