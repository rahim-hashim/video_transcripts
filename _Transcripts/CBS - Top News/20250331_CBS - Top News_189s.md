# Michigan car repair shop owner details how Trump tariffs will impact his business
**CBS - Top News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI)
*  As we've been reporting, President Trump will be imposing 25 percent tariffs on all imported [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=0.0s)]
*  vehicles and auto parts starting on April 3rd. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=5.28s)]
*  The president says his goal is to strengthen the country's auto manufacturing industry [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=8.2s)]
*  rather than have it rely on foreign imports. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=12.84s)]
*  However, these tariffs are expected to increase the average prices of new cars and parts for [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=15.92s)]
*  consumers. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=21.56s)]
*  If new auto parts become pricier, so will vehicle repairs. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=22.56s)]
*  Sam Darwish joins us now. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=25.92s)]
*  He's the owner of Northwestern Auto Repair in Farmington Hills, Michigan. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=27.16s)]
*  Sam, thanks for being here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=30.08s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=32.28s)]
*  How much of the auto parts you use for car repairs come from outside the U.S.? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  That's a good question. A lot. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=38.24s)]
*  I want to say at least 90 percent of them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  It's kind of unfortunate that, you know, we're in a country that, you know, we used to build [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=44.36s)]
*  everything, send everything out. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Now we're importing everything. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=50.44s)]
*  So I know the short term we're going to probably suffer, but we'll see how the long term [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=52.6s)]
*  turns out. When the future holds. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=57.96s)]
*  When you say 90 percent, where are those car parts coming from? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=59.52s)]
*  A lot from China, Mexico. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  I have a part right in front of me. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=66.72s)]
*  It's made in Japan. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=68.36s)]
*  It's a General Motors part, but it's from Japan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=70.64s)]
*  Yeah. How will these tariffs affect your day to day operations? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, is charging more the only solution? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=77.44s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=79.72s)]
*  You know, you can only pass so much onto a customer, you know, as a mechanic, our [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  labor rates are a little bit high because cars are more complicated to work on, to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=88.6s)]
*  diagnose. So we try to help a customer by getting parts at a discount. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=92.72s)]
*  Now, with these 25 percent going up, it's not much we can help. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  And we're scared that customers will put off their repairs, hopefully not too long. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=102.8s)]
*  But we just don't know what's going to happen. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=107.44s)]
*  What would what would the impact of that be and what are your customers telling you? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=110.52s)]
*  Right now, so it hasn't kicked in yet, so no one's really said anything. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=115.64s)]
*  But who knows? You know, I mean, at the end of the day, we're going to have to adjust [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  to it. There's just no way around it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=124.56s)]
*  So you're going to have to explain it to them, right? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=126.6s)]
*  Of course. Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=129.4s)]
*  I mean, when you get these big repairs, there may be a thousand dollars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=130.96s)]
*  Now you're going to spend another couple of hundred dollars on top of it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=136.12s)]
*  They might say, you know, I'm going to put it off. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=139.0s)]
*  I'm going to wait. Well, some people have no choice. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=140.88s)]
*  They have to fix their car. But it's just it's just not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  where we want to be. You know, we want to just fix people's cars, get them on the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=149.0s)]
*  road and at a fair price. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  You mentioned that this might hurt in the short term. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=154.56s)]
*  Hopefully it'll be better in the long term. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=156.44s)]
*  But are you worried about your business? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=158.12s)]
*  Are you worried about being able to survive this? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=160.68s)]
*  You know, we've been in community for 20 years, so we got some pretty good [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=163.88s)]
*  customers that are really loyal. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=167.56s)]
*  I'm not too worried. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  So by the end of the day, I mean, what are you going to do if your car is not [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=172.88s)]
*  running or something is wrong? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=176.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, you're going to have to fix it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=178.07999999999998s)]
*  You know, it's just is what it is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=180.16s)]
*  Sam Darwish, thank you for being here and keep us posted on how you're doing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=182.64s)]
*  OK, I appreciate it. Thank you. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLIVyuGE5jI&t=186.84s)]
