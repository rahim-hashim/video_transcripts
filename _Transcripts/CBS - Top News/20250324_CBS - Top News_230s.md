# Appeals court reviewing Trump use of Alien Enemies Act for deportation flghts
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU)
*  But first, within the hour, a panel of federal judges will hear an appeal from the Trump administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=0.0s)]
*  in a battle over deportation policies and the right to due process. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=6.0s)]
*  Now, deportation flights of Venezuela started up again this weekend, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=10.0s)]
*  with the White House claiming that they are booting gang members from this country. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=14.0s)]
*  But now an appeals court will review President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=18.0s)]
*  to fast-track deportations without due process. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=23.0s)]
*  The White House launched an appeal after federal judge James Boasberg [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=26.0s)]
*  issued a restraining order halting the use of that wartime law. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=30.0s)]
*  President Trump continues to blast Judge Boasberg on social media, meanwhile. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=34.0s)]
*  Trump posted this weekend that he should be disbarred and compared him [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=38.0s)]
*  to the judge who presided over his New York fraud trial. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=42.0s)]
*  Now, at the same time, Attorney General Pam Bondi says the case could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=46.0s)]
*  This is an out-of-control judge, a federal judge trying to control our entire foreign policy, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=53.0s)]
*  and he cannot do it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=62.0s)]
*  Okay, let's bring in former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=64.0s)]
*  Tom, thank you so much for spending the time with us. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=68.0s)]
*  So what are you going to be looking for at today's hearing? What should we be watching for? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=70.0s)]
*  Oh, there's going to be a lot going on today, a lot to keep our eye on. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=75.0s)]
*  I think probably the most important thing is simply to get a read on the three judges, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=78.0s)]
*  the appeals judges who will be hearing the arguments today, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=82.0s)]
*  as to whether or not they do agree with the Attorney General that Judge Boasberg [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=85.0s)]
*  has basically gotten too far out on his skis here, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=89.0s)]
*  whether or not he is exercising judicial authority in kind of too aggressive a way, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=92.0s)]
*  and whether or not they agree that the president has what he views as basically unfettered authority [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=97.0s)]
*  to remove these individuals from the United States without a hearing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=103.0s)]
*  So Tom, what happens next if the court sides with the White House and then blocks Boasberg's ruling? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=106.0s)]
*  Well, for one thing, I suspect that the challengers would try to get that case up into the Supreme Court, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=112.0s)]
*  but in the meantime, it would give the president the authority to remove individuals basically without limitation [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=118.0s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act. That's the legal issue at the heart of this dispute [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=124.0s)]
*  concerning the president's constitutional authority to remove these individuals with a minimum of due process. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=128.0s)]
*  Now, the president has said he wants to have Judge Boasberg removed from the case entirely. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=134.0s)]
*  Is that even possible? I mean, last week or six days ago, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=139.0s)]
*  Chief Justice John Roberts said he rejects calls to impeach judges. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=142.0s)]
*  Who's going to win this back and forth here? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=146.0s)]
*  I think it's possible he gets removed, but I would say exceedingly unlikely in my book. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=148.0s)]
*  Judge Boasberg is the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=154.0s)]
*  I think that the judges that sit above him on the appeals court, by and large, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=158.0s)]
*  view him as a straight shooter, as a rational actor. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=162.0s)]
*  I haven't seen any evidence that suggests to me that these judges would be inclined to take Boasberg off the case. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=165.0s)]
*  Whether or not they agree with his legal analysis is a different question, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=171.0s)]
*  but as far as whether they're poised to knock him out of this case entirely, I really don't see that happening. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=174.0s)]
*  So looking kind of at this broader picture of this case here, Tom, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=179.0s)]
*  is this going to test the White House's relationship with the Supreme Court, do you think? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=183.0s)]
*  It's going to be an early indicator of whether or not the Supreme Court, number one, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=188.0s)]
*  wants to actually get involved in a lot of this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=192.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court doesn't have to hear every case that's offered up to it, so that will be one indicator. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=195.0s)]
*  Do they even want to get involved here? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=199.0s)]
*  And then if they do, the second question is whether or not they share President Trump's understanding of his constitutional powers as president. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=201.0s)]
*  That is an issue that's going to be coming up again and again over the next four years, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=209.0s)]
*  and this would be an early signal as to whether or not the justices of the United States Supreme Court [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=214.0s)]
*  share President Trump's broad understanding of his constitutional authority. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=219.0s)]
*  All right. It will be very interesting to see what happens with this one. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=223.0s)]
*  Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General Tom Dupree. Thank you so much, Tom, for being with us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3VF3W8luXU&t=225.0s)]
