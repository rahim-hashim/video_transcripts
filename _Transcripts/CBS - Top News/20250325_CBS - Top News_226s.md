# How the Signal texts among Trump's national security team could have exposed the U.S.
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI)
*  A journalist for the Atlantic reports he was put on a group chat with several high-ranking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=0.0s)]
*  White House officials and he received several messages discussing plans to bomb Bouthi targets [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=4.4s)]
*  in Yemen. A spokesperson for the National Security Council tells CBS News these messages appear to be [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=9.92s)]
*  authentic. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are weighing in on this controversy. House [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=15.92s)]
*  Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is calling for an investigation into this and when asked if National [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=21.12s)]
*  Security Advisor Mike Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegsatz should be disciplined, House Speaker [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=27.04s)]
*  Mike Johnson told reporters quote no no. Let's bring in our CBS News Senior National Security [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=32.32s)]
*  correspondent Charlie Bagadet now for more analysis on this. He's following everything from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=37.76s)]
*  the Pentagon. Charlie good morning to you. What are the national security and potential legal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=42.32s)]
*  implications of this? If you can hear me Charlie. Yeah I just got to Errol thank you. Well listen [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  by the way they're just running some tests in the back you hear these explosions going on in the [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=55.52s)]
*  background. There's another one. Okay so before we talk about national security we got to talk [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=58.88s)]
*  about the protection of forces in the field because you know when they talk about target [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=63.84s)]
*  acquisition right or or sequencing something that wasn't really included in that article for obvious [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=68.8s)]
*  reasons this is an experienced security journalist and he's not going to let that information out [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=75.28s)]
*  but he says that that was part of the discussion. Then you're talking about pointing out which [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=81.36s)]
*  targets are going to be taken out first and it's important it's not just military gobbledygook [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=87.36s)]
*  because the first thing you do in a widespread bombing campaign like the one launched last week [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=92.0s)]
*  against the Houthis is you disable the the enemy's ability to strike back right so you look for launch [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=97.52s)]
*  pads you look for drone launch pads you look for missile launch pads you go after command and control [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=104.4s)]
*  all of which we learned after the fact which is how it's supposed to happen the media finds out [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=110.72s)]
*  what was the target sequence what was the battle plan and then you find that out as it's happening [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=115.92s)]
*  you can understand how dangerous this can be to fighter pilots and their aircraft more importantly [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=121.6s)]
*  to stretch it out to a national security concern if anybody else who had more capability than the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  Houthis for instance Iran or or China or Russia were to be able to access that kind of information [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=132.4s)]
*  well then you've just given them the U.S. tactics right the U.S. battle plan that is where it impacts [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=139.2s)]
*  national security. And you're right to point out that the journalist Mr. Goldberg actually held [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  back on a lot of the most sensitive information that he witnessed in that group chat exchange [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  so considering all this then national security advisor Mike Waltz is the person who allegedly [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=158.16s)]
*  added Mr. Goldberg to the chat what might all of this mean for his future role in the administration [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=163.04s)]
*  which is pretty central and key at this point? You know it's a good question because the White [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=169.92s)]
*  House came out and said that President Trump the White House spokesman came out and said [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=175.04s)]
*  President Trump still supports his national security team including Mike Waltz but listen [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  there's going to be a lot of attention specifically on him as we pointed out in our reports there are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  about 18 people in that right Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegsat, Mike Waltz they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=188.96s)]
*  were all in that chat however it appears that he's the one who sort of pulled the trigger and invited [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=194.96s)]
*  Mr. Goldberg into the group chat so he may be more culpable but at the same time he's also at the top [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=200.72s)]
*  of the chain in terms of national security. Those questions will be asked today and I think he in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=206.08s)]
*  particular is going to face a lot of heat because of his involvement in this particular [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=212.56s)]
*  chat group. Yeah all right Charlie Daggett are joining us from the Pentagon this morning with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=219.12s)]
*  important perspective. Charlie thank you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPY0YLRz9qI&t=223.68s)]
