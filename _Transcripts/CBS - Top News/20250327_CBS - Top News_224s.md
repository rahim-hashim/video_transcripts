# 10,000 jobs being cut at Department of Health and Human Services
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ)
*  10,000 jobs about to be gutted from the Department of Health and Human Services. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  CBS News reporter Alex Tin watching this announcement. Alex, what's getting cut and why? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=4.08s)]
*  Yeah, so it's important to put this announcement in context. They are [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=9.0s)]
*  announcing today 10,000 layoffs at HHS, the Department of Health and Human [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=13.56s)]
*  Services. Some of the biggest cuts are going to happen at the Food and Drug [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=18.6s)]
*  Administration. That's the agency that's responsible for approving new drugs and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=22.2s)]
*  doing food safety inspections. Some of the other agencies that are also going to [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=26.2s)]
*  see thousands of employees let go include the Centers for Disease Control [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=29.8s)]
*  and Prevention as well as the National Institutes of Health. The amount of cuts, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=33.64s)]
*  that 10,000 number of workers that are being cut, that comes after thousands of [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=38.44s)]
*  workers have already left the department. By the department's estimation, that is [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=43.16s)]
*  going to put them at 62,000 workers after all these cuts and departures are [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=48.16s)]
*  done as part of a larger reorganization. And again, just to put that in context, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=52.96s)]
*  that's down from more than 90,000 workers at the department at the end of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=57.68s)]
*  Biden administration. That's 33% less workers at the department. Yeah, this is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=62.08s)]
*  not many weeks after the confirmation of RFK Jr. being at the wheel of HHS. He's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=67.36s)]
*  also announced plans to create the so-called AHA. What do we know about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  that? That's right. Yeah, it's the Administration for a Healthy America AHA. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=76.8s)]
*  It's a brand new agency that's designed to essentially group together a lot of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=83.55999999999999s)]
*  the priorities that we've heard Secretary Kennedy talk about since before [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=88.27999999999999s)]
*  he was secretary back when he was just on the campaign trail supporting then [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=91.96s)]
*  candidate and now President Trump. Some of the biggest things that are going to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=96.0s)]
*  be under this umbrella span everything from the Substance Abuse and Mental [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=99.6s)]
*  Health Services Administration all the way over to the work that's going on [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=103.08s)]
*  right now at HHS to update federal nutrition guidelines. That's those [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  dietary guidelines that school lunch programs and head start programs and all [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  kinds of other federal agencies and federal grand funding rely on to come [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=115.08s)]
*  up with how to feed Children and families. So again, all of these are [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=119.39999999999999s)]
*  being grouped together in this new agency that's going to be essentially [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=123.64s)]
*  separate and apart from a lot of the other agencies that we know about like [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  NIH, CDC and FDA. Alex, I have to ask you because all of this is playing out [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  against the backdrop of what is a national news story where health and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=135.6s)]
*  human services really is concerned and that's outbreak in more than one [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=139.44s)]
*  cuts. Will any of those cuts affect the outreach where vaccination rates are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=146.96s)]
*  concerned or the outreach we're trying to stamp down this measles outbreak is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=151.96s)]
*  concerned? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the short answer is we just don't know yet. You know, a lot of the details [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=157.2s)]
*  of these cuts have not been disclosed to agency health officials. You know, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=160.84s)]
*  some of the people that I speak with within the CDC, for example, tell me [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=164.76s)]
*  that managers just weren't consulted. They have no idea where these cuts are [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=168.44s)]
*  gonna happen. Of course, we're going to find out where these cuts are gonna [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=172.24s)]
*  happen soon. Both unions as well as agency health officials say they've [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=175.68s)]
*  been told that the first notices of the federal employees who will be cut as a [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=179.72s)]
*  result of this change are gonna start as soon as tomorrow. And so when the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=183.85999999999999s)]
*  dust settles, we're gonna get a better sense of where exactly within the CDC [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=188.32s)]
*  and these other health agencies these cuts are going to come from. For what [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=192.34s)]
*  it's worth, the Trump administration and Kennedy's team say that the majority of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=197.0s)]
*  their cuts are focused on eliminating duplication. What they say is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=200.8s)]
*  essentially administrative functions, communications functions and other kinds [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=204.4s)]
*  of, you know, offices within these agencies that they say are essentially [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=208.52s)]
*  duplicated and will be able to be consolidated and, quote, streamlined [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  once these agencies are combined. Well, we know when we get the fine details, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=216.84s)]
*  you will have it nice to talk to you. Alex, you have a great day there in our [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=220.72000000000003s)]
*  nation's capital. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_GIRKEozeQ&t=223.60000000000002s)]
