# Questions remain about Trump plan to dismantle Education Department
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0)
*  And President Trump plans to sign an executive order today that lays the groundwork for the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=0.0s)]
*  eventual shutdown of the U.S. Department of Education. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  The president has already started gutting the agency, which provides billions of dollars [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=7.92s)]
*  a year to schools and oversees $1.6 trillion in federal student loans. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=12.44s)]
*  Full closure of the department would require congressional approval. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=18.28s)]
*  But for more on this, let's bring in CBS News Senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=21.96s)]
*  Weijia, good morning to you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=25.48s)]
*  We know that Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been reminding people of the things her [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=27.48s)]
*  department does not do, but help us understand what dismantling it will mean for what it [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  does for parents, for students and even graduates. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=37.88s)]
*  Well, Errol, we don't exactly know because right now the administration is in the process [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=41.32s)]
*  of transferring all the responsibilities that the department does have out to other agencies [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=46.54s)]
*  and trying to see how they are going to be able to retain some of the critical services [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=53.36s)]
*  that students from around the country rely on. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=58.04s)]
*  McMahon is right in that the federal department doesn't dictate the curriculum. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=61.2s)]
*  It does not tell the states to then tell the local schools exactly what to teach. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=66.8s)]
*  States already have that control. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=73.88s)]
*  As you mentioned, Errol, it does help navigate so much money for student aid and financial [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=76.0s)]
*  aid and student loans that people rely on even after they graduate from college and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=83.12s)]
*  high school, obviously. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=89.16s)]
*  The issue there is where that is going to go. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=92.4s)]
*  Is it going to go to the Department of Treasury as an example? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=95.0s)]
*  Then, of course, there are critical programs that the department essentially serves as [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  a checks and balances on for other schools throughout the country to make sure students [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=103.64s)]
*  with disabilities have exactly what they need, that they are following all the laws when [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=109.8s)]
*  it comes to DEI programs, which we know the administration has gutted. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=114.44s)]
*  They're still trying to work out all the details. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=121.0s)]
*  Today's executive order actually does not address any of that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=123.04s)]
*  It is largely ceremonial directing Linda McMahon to start facilitating the process to shut [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=126.52s)]
*  down the department. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  But as you rightfully mentioned, it is going to take an act of Congress likely to shutter [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  the entire thing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=138.96s)]
*  Yeah, we'll keep watching this closely. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=139.96s)]
*  Weijia, thank you very much. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CysyJe6TKO0&t=141.72s)]
