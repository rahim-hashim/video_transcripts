# Netanyahu vows to intensify pressure in Gaza as Hamas says it approved ceasefire proposal
**CBS - Top News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M)
*  We turn now to the situation in Gaza where Israel's military this morning has issued [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=0.0s)]
*  evacuation orders covering most of the enclave's southern city of Ra'far. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=5.04s)]
*  This comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to intensify pressure on Hamas [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=9.88s)]
*  over the weekend and called on the militant group to disarm. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=15.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, on Saturday, Hamas said it approved a new ceasefire proposal put forward by mediators. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=18.96s)]
*  Israel said it received a draft plan and submitted a counterproposal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=25.32s)]
*  Joining us now for the latest on all of this is CBS News contributor Robert Berger. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=29.36s)]
*  Robert, good morning to you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=33.2s)]
*  What can you tell us about these evacuation orders in southern Gaza? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=34.6s)]
*  Yeah, the city of Ra'far is on the border with Egypt and it's a strategic point of smuggling. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=37.84s)]
*  And these evacuation orders suggest that Israel is gearing up for a further assault on Gaza [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=47.04s)]
*  after the collapse of the ceasefire a couple of weeks ago. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  Tens of thousands of Palestinians now are going to be forced to move to a so-called [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=58.32s)]
*  safe zone about six miles away. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  And over the weekend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel is negotiating [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=66.8s)]
*  under fire. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=71.28s)]
*  Its aim is to increase the military pressure on Hamas to get it to release the Israeli [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=72.36s)]
*  hostages, 59 hostages still in Gaza, of whom 24 are believed to be alive. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=78.64s)]
*  And so there's an effort for this renewed ceasefire, but it doesn't seem as if there's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=85.56s)]
*  been traction on that front. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=91.08s)]
*  Meantime, what is happening with Prime Minister Netanyahu domestically? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=92.84s)]
*  Well, he's on trial, his ongoing corruption trial today took kind of a new twist because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  prosecutors wanted to question him about an issue involving Qatar. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  One of his aides has been arrested for allegedly taking illegal payments from Qatar in order [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=110.96s)]
*  to improve that country's image while they were negotiating a hostage deal between Israel [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=118.83999999999999s)]
*  and Hamas. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=126.24s)]
*  And this has become a big domestic issue and provided fuel for Netanyahu's opponents who [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=127.24s)]
*  say he should be ousted from power because he's corrupt. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=135.2s)]
*  This has become known as Cuttergate and it's just another headache for Netanyahu amid [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=139.28s)]
*  this ongoing war. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=143.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=145.0s)]
*  2.16 there in Jerusalem. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=146.0s)]
*  Robert Berger, thanks for that update. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=147.32s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG23Bh3Rs2M&t=148.68s)]
