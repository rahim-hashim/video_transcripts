# Americans' economic outlook grows a bit more pessimistic, CBS News poll finds
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys)
*  Welcome back. A brand new, we love to say that, a brand new CBS News poll finds [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=0.0s)]
*  Americans outlook for the economy has grown just a bit more pessimistic in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=5.74s)]
*  past month. High prices are weighing on people's minds with most saying as far [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=9.78s)]
*  as they're concerned and as far as their budget is concerned they're still on the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  ride. Here with me is CBS News executive director of elections and surveys, your [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=17.42s)]
*  friend and mine Anthony Salvanto. Tell us Anthony what we have learned. Hey man, how [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=22.0s)]
*  you doing? Look, start with this major where you've got, yes as you said before, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=26.34s)]
*  you've got this larger number now since last month who think that looking ahead [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=31.3s)]
*  to the next year the economy might be in recession. So a little bit less optimism [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=36.38s)]
*  there but the other thing I want to show everybody is that this collectively, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=40.9s)]
*  whether people think it's going to be booming or in recession or something in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=45.900000000000006s)]
*  between, is uncertainty and that's what's reflected here collectively because if [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  you take a look at then why people say they evaluate the economy the way they [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=55.18s)]
*  do major, look at this, nine in ten say it is because of prices. They don't think [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=60.46s)]
*  their incomes are keeping up with inflation. That has not changed. You and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=65.18s)]
*  I have been standing here talking about this for years since the pandemic and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=68.58s)]
*  that is continuing to hit Americans. And it's worth pointing out this is not a [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=72.1s)]
*  massive shift in the data but it does suggest that there's some some hesitancy [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=76.98s)]
*  when people hear the president talk as boastfully about what's going to come. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=82.5s)]
*  Golden Age of America, Renaissance, huge economic boom, they're a little bit [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=87.02s)]
*  hesitant. At least that's a week I think safely conclude from this data. Well [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=92.1s)]
*  there's a lot in here major and one of the things we've seen in previous polling [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=95.74s)]
*  is that people are concerned that tariffs might raise prices. We know that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  and the other thing that we see, remember this doesn't affect everybody [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=105.82s)]
*  equally because take a look at these income splits for people who are at the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=110.3s)]
*  upper end of the income scale they're much more likely to say their financial [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=115.94s)]
*  situation is good than people who are not and so remember it's not just [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  partisanship it's a lot about income and how inflation and prices affect folks [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=125.86s)]
*  major. And how they affect folks day to day affects how they look now into the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=130.78s)]
*  future. Anthony Savonto, always a pleasure sir thank you. Thank you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJJiluaSCys&t=136.54s)]
