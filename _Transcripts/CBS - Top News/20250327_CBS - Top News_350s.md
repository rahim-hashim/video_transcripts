# Anger at Pentagon over Hegseth's texts in Signal group chat with Trump team
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k)
*  Former Pentagon officials are voicing their concerns about this signal app controversy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=0.0s)]
*  Earlier I spoke with a former Pentagon press secretary, that's Sabrina Singh, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=5.2s)]
*  after reviewing the leaked messages. She told me that an independent investigation likely needs [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=9.52s)]
*  to be launched immediately. You automatically need to have the inspector general of the Department [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=14.8s)]
*  of Defense launch an independent investigation into the secretary, into these text threads, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=20.88s)]
*  into this texting chain to figure out what happened and to determine, rightfully, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=27.36s)]
*  that classified information was in fact typed out and put in this text message. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=34.24s)]
*  So I think that's the first thing. The second thing is it's going to be painful, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=40.32s)]
*  but you have to work with Congress and you have to let Congress also investigate. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=43.6s)]
*  CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett joins us now from the Pentagon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Charlie, there are some on Capitol Hill now calling for an independent investigation [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=53.6s)]
*  into how this all happened. The Pentagon has had a full 24 hours to digest all of it. How much [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=57.84s)]
*  more pressure is on the Secretary of Defense today, despite the administration's efforts to deflect? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=64.08s)]
*  Yeah, Errol, you know, as Sabrina said, and I've been in touch with her throughout this [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  whole debacle myself, looking for some sort of insight for that. And she mentioned the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=76.88s)]
*  inspector general. We don't have an inspector general at the moment. So that would be step one, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=82.08s)]
*  right? So it needs to be an internal investigation as to exactly what happened. It's not hard to see [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=86.0s)]
*  what happened and exactly the conversations that took place. You know, as it was just said [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=91.44s)]
*  by our colleague, it's pretty plainly stated. This is a conversation. It wasn't an investigation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=99.36s)]
*  It wasn't a leak. It was clear. And nobody, by the way, has pushed back on that because they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=106.32s)]
*  can't because it's very clear. It's there in black and white, as Ed said. So from that point on, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=112.24s)]
*  now there will be political pressure. And that's why I think we have to see over the next couple [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=118.8s)]
*  of days what goes on here, because quite frankly speaking, the people in this building follow [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=124.24s)]
*  orders, right, under the Constitution, but they follow orders because there is a rank and file [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=129.76s)]
*  system here. At the top of that rank and file is the defense secretary himself. So there's a lot of [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=134.32s)]
*  frustration, a lot of embarrassment, frankly, embarrassment to what they've seen transpire. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=138.88s)]
*  Those conversations shouldn't have been taking place in the first place, and they certainly [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=144.48s)]
*  shouldn't have been made public. That is unheard of, and people here are angry about that. But they [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  don't have a lot of power in terms of pushing that forward. There will be pressure on Secretary [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=153.44s)]
*  Hegseth, but that pressure has to come from the top. You've got the president calling all the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=160.16s)]
*  shots, National Security Council under him. Then I would argue that's where the Pentagon and the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=165.52s)]
*  defense secretary fall in after that. So it has to come from the top. It won't come from the bottom. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=170.4s)]
*  They're angry about it. They're frustrated about it. But there's not a lot they can do in terms of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=174.8s)]
*  leverage to push that out. And Hegseth, as you have seen, has remained defiant. He has said that the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=178.72s)]
*  information that he shared on that group chat on Signal was declassified or unclassified. In a way, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=185.68s)]
*  he has a vote in that, right? Because he can determine—there are certain parameters in [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=193.6s)]
*  place—but he can determine what he deems as classified and unclassified information and the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  way that he shares it. So yes, there'll be a lot of heat on him. But, you know, President Trump is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=205.28s)]
*  in a weird conundrum. As we all know, he's a loyalist to a certain degree. I mean, during the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=210.16s)]
*  last Trump administration, he went through five defense secretaries over the course of like two [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=217.52s)]
*  months. So this is a disposable position. So it just remains to be seen exactly how much of this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=222.88s)]
*  blowback is going to affect the president's administration itself. And I'm glad you mentioned, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=230.0s)]
*  Charlie, the hierarchy of the Pentagon. It was also mentioned during the hearing yesterday that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=235.12s)]
*  this is a, of course, leadership position. And how can you expect your troops to follow exactly [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=239.28s)]
*  what you do and abide by the same policies if the secretary of defense doesn't abide by the basics [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=245.28s)]
*  in communication? Let's talk about the battlefield, because the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=251.04s)]
*  they're still launching rockets at Israel. Has anything changed tactically in the wake of this? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=255.36s)]
*  Do they seem emboldened in any way? You know, it's an important point to make here, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=263.59999999999997s)]
*  because in the background of all of this, this Houthi conflict is continuing. I'm not entirely [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=268.96s)]
*  sure that they'll be emboldened by it, because in a way, it's kind of what they would have expected [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=274.56s)]
*  anyway. Now, I've studied the Houthis for years. They are a tenacious organization, and they will [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=279.76s)]
*  continue to fight. So I'm sure they're relishing in all of this. You know, regardless of the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  information that got out, as the Trump administration continues to say, it was a [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=293.28s)]
*  successful mission. I also need to point out, not only are the Houthis firing back and trying to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  strike Israel, this new phase of the conflict that began a week ago last Saturday is continuing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=304.08s)]
*  The United States hasn't pressed pause in any way, shape or form on their attacks on the Houthis, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=313.52s)]
*  whether this is a sort of leak or a national security leak or whether it had any kind of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=318.96s)]
*  impact on the conflict or the pace or the tempo of the fighting itself. Absolutely not. Every [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=324.08s)]
*  single day, they're still launching the F-18s. They're still launching these cruise missiles. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  They're still launching these drones to fight and attack Houthi targets. That has not slowed down [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=334.56s)]
*  at all, even in the wake of what's happened. All right, Charlie Dagata, with the latest [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=340.56s)]
*  information up to the minute. Joining us from the Pentagon, Charlie, always a pleasure. Thank you so much. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaGcgvpL2k&t=345.76s)]
