# Ukraine is willing to accept a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, U.S. officials say
**CBS - Top News:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08)
*  We do want to bring you some breaking news as it's just coming in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to take you now to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=3.0s)]
*  is discussing an apparent breakthrough in talks with Ukraine on efforts to end Russia's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=7.16s)]
*  invasion. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=12.52s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=13.52s)]
*  Hopefully, we'll take this off for now to the Russians. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=14.52s)]
*  And we hope that they'll say yes, that they'll say yes to peace. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=17.48s)]
*  The ball is now in their court. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=19.76s)]
*  But again, the president's objective here is, number one, above everything else, he [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  wants the war to end. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=26.16s)]
*  And I think today Ukraine has taken a concrete step in that regard. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=27.880000000000003s)]
*  We hope the Russians will reciprocate. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=30.64s)]
*  Well, just to add to the secretary's comments, the Ukrainian delegation today made something [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=33.04s)]
*  very clear, that they share President Trump's vision for peace. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=41.08s)]
*  They share his determination to end the fighting, to end the killing, to end the tragic meat [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=46.8s)]
*  grinder of people and national treasure that's happening on the front in Ukraine, number [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=54.44s)]
*  one. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=63.36s)]
*  Number two, they made concrete steps and concrete proposals, not only accepting our proposal [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=64.36s)]
*  for a full ceasefire, which you can see the details of which are in our joint statement [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=72.64s)]
*  we released together, but we also got into substantive details on how this war is going [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=79.92s)]
*  to permanently end, what type of guarantees they're going to have for their long-term [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  security and prosperity, but also really looking at what it's going to take to finally end [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=93.28s)]
*  this horrific fighting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  The other piece that I just want to make very clear is President Trump started this diplomatic [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=105.72s)]
*  effort in the Oval Office talking to both leaders, both President Putin and President [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=111.48s)]
*  Zelensky back to back, and now that shuttle diplomacy continues. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=117.12s)]
*  We have a named delegation in terms of next steps from the Russian side. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=123.0s)]
*  We have a named delegation in terms of next steps from the Ukrainian side. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=127.64s)]
*  I will talk to my Russian counterpart in the coming days. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=134.24s)]
*  Secretary Rubio will be with G7 foreign ministers in the next couple of days. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=139.68s)]
*  We have the NATO secretary general in the White House on Thursday, and we'll take the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=146.04s)]
*  process forward from there. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=153.96s)]
*  As a result of that, and I think as a result of this positive step forward, the president [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=157.32s)]
*  has decided to lift the pause on aid and on our security assistance to Ukraine going forward, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  and that's effective immediately. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=171.39999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  Your colleagues have chosen three questioners. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=173.39999999999998s)]
*  Let's start with Alex Marquardt of CNN. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=175.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=177.6s)]
*  Several questions on the ceasefire. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=178.6s)]
*  We understood that coming into this, this was a Ukrainian proposal for a partial ceasefire. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  How did this become an American proposal for an immediate 30-day ceasefire? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=185.2s)]
*  To be clear, you're talking about a complete ceasefire across the front line, not just [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=191.48s)]
*  the aerial and maritime ceasefire that the Ukrainians proposed. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=196.35999999999999s)]
*  Then finally, how do you expect to take this to the Russians? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  Is it Mr. Witkoff, who we understand is heading to Moscow later this week? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=203.88s)]
*  Will he deliver that to Putin? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=207.48s)]
*  Will it be President Trump to President Putin? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=208.48s)]
*  Will it be you and your counterparts? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=210.48s)]
*  How will that actually happen and when? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  On the first point, your question is yes. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=214.28s)]
*  That's the offer. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=217.16s)]
*  The offer is to stop the shooting. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=218.16s)]
*  The goal here is the only way to end this war is to negotiate out of it. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=219.72s)]
*  There's no military solution to this war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=223.88s)]
*  The solution to this war and the way to end it and to achieve the president's objective [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=225.92s)]
*  of peace is to negotiate. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=230.6s)]
*  But before you can negotiate, you have to stop shooting at each other. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=233.0s)]
*  And that's what the president has wanted to see. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=235.76s)]
*  And that's what that's the commitment we got today from the Ukrainian side, their willingness [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=237.52s)]
*  to do that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=240.76s)]
*  Obviously, now that will be delivered to the Russians. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=241.76s)]
*  It'll be delivered to them directly through multiple channels, meaning not only will they [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=243.56s)]
*  see it, it'll be communicated to them through our diplomatic channels, through conversations [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=248.55999999999997s)]
*  and other methods. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=252.92s)]
*  But they'll obviously be well aware. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=253.92s)]
*  And our hope is that the Russians will say yes, that they will also agree. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=254.92s)]
*  So the shooting will stop, the killing will stop, the dying will stop, and the talks can [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=258.84s)]
*  begin about how to end this war permanently in a way that's acceptable and enduring for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=263.08s)]
*  both sides. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=267.5s)]
*  There's been all kinds of discussions in terms of different types of ceasefires. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=269.8s)]
*  There was the deal in terms of grain moving years ago. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=276.68s)]
*  There's been discussion of halting aerial attacks on each other's infrastructure. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  The president has made it clear and certainly made it clear to us that all fighting needs [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=287.68s)]
*  to stop. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=292.92s)]
*  And the Ukrainians have agreed to that proposal. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  They're ready for peace. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=298.12s)]
*  And now we'll take that to the Russians and get their response. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=300.0s)]
*  All right, next, Jen from Jacobs, CBS. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=303.92s)]
*  Great. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Hi. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Are you expecting any goodwill gestures from Russia? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  Do you have a deadline in mind for when you're hoping for them to reciprocate on that? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=311.08000000000004s)]
*  Those two things. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, we're going to take the offer to them. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  We're going to tell them this is what's on the table. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=319.40000000000003s)]
*  Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  And now it'll be up to them to say yes or no. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=324.22s)]
*  I hope they're going to say yes. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  And if they do, then I think we've made great progress. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=327.16s)]
*  If they say no, then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=329.36s)]
*  But the president's been abundantly clear. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=333.40000000000003s)]
*  He wants the shooting to stop. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=334.8s)]
*  He wants the warfare to stop. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=336.14s)]
*  He wants the dying and the suffering to stop. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=337.36s)]
*  And he believes, and rightfully so, that the only way to end this war is to negotiate an [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=339.72s)]
*  end to it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=344.0s)]
*  And we think that it's always easier to negotiate an end to the war when people aren't shooting [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=345.0s)]
*  at each other. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=348.24s)]
*  That's how the president believes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=349.24s)]
*  That's what we hope to achieve. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  The Ukrainians today have expressed their willingness and readiness to do so immediately. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  We hope the Russians' answer to that will also be yes. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=355.2s)]
*  But no deadline set, sir. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=357.64s)]
*  So the deadline is we hope to do this as soon as possible. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=359.35999999999996s)]
*  Every day that goes by that this war continues, people die, people are bombed, people are [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=361.44s)]
*  hurt on both sides of this conflict. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=364.85999999999996s)]
*  The president wanted this war to end yesterday and the day before. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  The president's been clear. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=369.85999999999996s)]
*  He wants peace. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  And so we wanted to see it as soon as possible. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=372.09999999999997s)]
*  So our hope is that the Russians will answer yes as quickly as possible so we can get to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  the second phase of this, which is real negotiations, not never-ending dialogue, talk forever, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=378.08s)]
*  but real negotiations to end this conflict in a way that's acceptable to both sides, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=384.23999999999995s)]
*  sustainable, and that ensures the stability and security of Ukraine for the long term. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=388.68s)]
*  And on the goodwill gesture, is there anything like the return of the stolen children or [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=392.52s)]
*  anything that you're expecting in return? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  Look, we've discussed a number of things, prisoner exchanges, folks that were detained [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=397.6s)]
*  and what have you, but the fighting has to stop. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=404.32s)]
*  That's what we agreed today. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=407.6s)]
*  And just think about it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=408.6s)]
*  We've gone from if the war's going to end to now how the war's going to end. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=410.92s)]
*  This was an important first step, and that was under President Trump's leadership. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  He has literally moved the entire global conversation to where we had a very senior Ukrainian delegation [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=420.11999999999995s)]
*  with us today. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=425.64s)]
*  We've had engagements with our Russian counterparts, and now it's how the war's going to end, and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=426.64s)]
*  that's under President Trump's leadership. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=432.76s)]
*  Just to answer your question one more time, the goal here is peace. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=434.35999999999996s)]
*  That's the president's goal. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=438.0s)]
*  The best goodwill gesture the Russians can provide is to say yes. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=440.52s)]
*  To say yes to the offer that the Ukrainians have made to stop the shooting, to stop the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=444.6s)]
*  fighting and get to the table. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=449.12s)]
*  If they do that, that's the best goodwill sign we could see. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=450.64s)]
*  Obviously, as part of that negotiation, as we're talking about how to end this conflict, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=454.2s)]
*  there will be a lot of issues to unravel. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=457.4s)]
*  Among them, not the least of which is the humanitarian concerns, the children, the prisoners [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=459.64s)]
*  of war, all the things that sadly come with these conflicts. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=463.44s)]
*  But the number one goodwill gesture we could see from the Russians is to see the Ukrainian [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=467.08s)]
*  offer and reciprocate it with a yes. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=470.44s)]
*  Next, for Reuters, Daphne Saladakis. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=473.52s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=476.79999999999995s)]
*  Could you clarify what security assistance will be resumed? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=478.2s)]
*  Does this include the PDAs? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  And why wasn't the minerals deal signed today? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=483.2s)]
*  What are the outstanding issues there? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  And if I may, is the relationship with Ukrainian President Zelensky back on track? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=487.79999999999995s)]
*  Do you back him? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, let me answer the second question, or the third yet, too, and then I'll let the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=493.2s)]
*  security advisor talk about the defense and security assistance. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  On the second question, let me answer first on the minerals deal as part of our communication [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=500.88000000000005s)]
*  today. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=505.52000000000004s)]
*  That is something that was negotiated through our Treasury and his counterpart on the Ukrainian [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=506.52000000000004s)]
*  side. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=509.8s)]
*  And so the president, and you see that expressed, both presidents will instruct the appropriate [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=510.8s)]
*  members of our governments to bring to finality the signature of the deal and the signature [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=514.96s)]
*  of this agreement. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=519.72s)]
*  So that was communicated today, and that's going to happen. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=520.84s)]
*  That was not the subject of our talks today. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=523.62s)]
*  I expressed that on our way in. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=525.24s)]
*  We were here in pursuit of peace. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=528.32s)]
*  That doesn't mean the minerals deal is not very important. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=529.98s)]
*  It most certainly is. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=531.82s)]
*  And we expressed that today in the statements we put out jointly, that the president, our [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=532.82s)]
*  respective presidents have instructed the appropriate members of their governments to [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=537.34s)]
*  bring this to finality and to conclusion. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=541.9s)]
*  The second part of your question was? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=544.26s)]
*  Does the security assistance include this? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=546.0600000000001s)]
*  No, there was one after that. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=548.26s)]
*  And then Zelensky, you should keep that on track. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=549.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=552.26s)]
*  What's back on track here, hopefully, is peace. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=553.26s)]
*  That's what matters the most. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=555.02s)]
*  I know everyone's looking for who likes this. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=556.02s)]
*  This is serious stuff. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=558.14s)]
*  Okay, we're not. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=559.3s)]
*  This is not Mean Girls. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=560.3s)]
*  This is not some episode of some television show. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=561.3s)]
*  This is very serious. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=562.9s)]
*  People are going to today. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=563.9s)]
*  People will die in this war. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=564.9s)]
*  They died yesterday. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=566.02s)]
*  And sadly, unless there's a ceasefire tonight, they'll die tomorrow. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=567.02s)]
*  The president wants that to stop. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=569.78s)]
*  That's what he's interested in here. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=571.9s)]
*  That's why we came here. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=573.42s)]
*  That's why we're grateful for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia hosting us here. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=574.58s)]
*  And what we leave here with today is a commitment that the Ukrainians are ready to stop fighting. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  They're ready to stop the shooting so that they can get to the table and bring about [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=583.0s)]
*  peace for their country and for the world on the security. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=586.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, I just can't echo enough President Trump's present a piece. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=589.14s)]
*  That's what he's demanding. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=593.86s)]
*  And he's willing to take tough measures on it on all sides to drive that home. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=594.86s)]
*  And in terms of the security assistance, it's the current presidential drawdown authority. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=600.5799999999999s)]
*  I'll refer to the Defense Department on the each is of what munition was where in the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=604.78s)]
*  process. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=609.2199999999999s)]
*  But it's the current PDA that will that will proceed to the Ukrainians. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=610.2199999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=614.3399999999999s)]
*  Everyone, thank you. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=615.7800000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=616.7800000000001s)]

*  We've been listening to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=621.7800000000001s)]
*  Mike Waltz discussing a new deal between the U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=625.1s)]
*  Ukraine says it would accept a U.S. proposal calling for an immediate 30-day ceasefire [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=629.58s)]
*  with Russia. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=634.38s)]
*  The U.S. is also immediately lifting its paws on intelligence sharing with Ukraine. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=635.38s)]
*  The U.S. remember pause sharing intel shortly after an Oval Office meeting between President [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=640.5s)]
*  Trump and Zelensky. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=645.14s)]
*  That meeting blew up more than a week ago. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=646.86s)]
*  The U.S. will also resume security assistance to Ukraine. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=648.9399999999999s)]
*  And now Secretary of State Marco Rubio is essentially encouraging Russia to get on board [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=651.98s)]
*  saying the ball's in their court. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=657.22s)]
*  Let's go ahead and bring in Sam Vinograd, CBS News National Security Attributor and [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=658.74s)]
*  former Assistant Secretary for Counterterrorism at the Department of Homeland Security. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=662.8199999999999s)]
*  She joins us from Washington. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=666.86s)]
*  Sam, obviously this is major movement in this conflict. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=668.74s)]
*  But at the same time, this is a proposal hammered out between the U.S. and Ukraine with Russia [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=672.78s)]
*  not having a seat at the table in this particular meeting. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=677.92s)]
*  What is your reaction? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=681.16s)]
*  Well, my reaction is that Ukraine now has some leverage back in these negotiations by [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=682.16s)]
*  now having access to U.S. security assistance and intelligence used for offensive operations [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=687.54s)]
*  into Russia. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=693.5799999999999s)]
*  Ukraine now has more leverage to enter negotiations with Russia on more equal terms. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=694.5799999999999s)]
*  Zelensky's visit to Washington after security assistance was frozen, after this offensive [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=701.5s)]
*  intelligence was taken off the table, Ukraine was really operating from a position of weakness. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=707.06s)]
*  That has changed. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=712.46s)]
*  Now, of course, the big question is what is Russia going to say next? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=713.46s)]
*  Getting Russia to agree to a ceasefire that the Ukrainians would agree to is not a foregone [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=718.22s)]
*  conclusion. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=722.9399999999999s)]
*  And I'll note that Secretary of State Rubio and National Security Advisor Walz kept stressing [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=723.9399999999999s)]
*  that the president's sole focus is stopping the fighting. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=729.78s)]
*  And the question here is, what are the costs associated with that for both sides? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=733.34s)]
*  We haven't heard what those costs would be for the Ukrainians nor for the Russians. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=737.14s)]
*  So this is a significant step. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=741.9s)]
*  But getting Putin on board in a meaningful way is going to be quite difficult. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=743.88s)]
*  Can you explain to me a little further about how Ukraine's leverage leverage position has [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=747.5s)]
*  changed? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=751.1s)]
*  Prior to the United States agreeing to reestablish security assistance and intelligence sharing, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=752.82s)]
*  Ukraine was facing a significant vacuum in support from the United States. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=760.7s)]
*  While European countries announced that they would step forward to provide more security [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=765.94s)]
*  assistance to Ukraine, it's not a one for one exchange. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=769.86s)]
*  So absent billions of dollars in U.S. security assistance, Ukraine was going to lose really [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=773.2s)]
*  critical access to both funding as well as actual military assets, Lindsey, that the [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=779.26s)]
*  Europeans just could not replace. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=785.5400000000001s)]
*  And from an intelligence perspective, not having access to U.S. intelligence that allowed [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=787.62s)]
*  Ukraine to strike inside of Russia made Russia feel most likely the combination of those [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=792.94s)]
*  two things, like it had the upper hand in both the war against Ukraine and in any negotiations [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=798.38s)]
*  to try to resolve the conflict. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=804.5400000000001s)]
*  So we also have reporting from our Charlie Dagata that there will be an immediate resumption [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=806.56s)]
*  of the presidential drawdown authority, which refers to roughly three point eight billion [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=810.6199999999999s)]
*  dollars in U.S. military aid. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=814.64s)]
*  This has already been approved. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=816.28s)]
*  So largely air defense systems, artillery, some support of Ukraine's f-16s. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=817.5799999999999s)]
*  How significant is that? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=822.4599999999999s)]
*  This is huge. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=824.6199999999999s)]
*  And again, losing access to three point eight, almost four billion dollars of U.S. security [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=825.6199999999999s)]
*  assistance for Ukraine so quickly, it was truly catastrophic in thinking about the tides [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=831.36s)]
*  of the war and who is going to have the upper hand just from a pure military conflict standpoint. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=836.88s)]
*  Putting this back on the table shows that Ukraine will be able to hold territory in [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=842.2s)]
*  the way it has so far if Russia does not agree to come to the table in a meaningful way to [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=847.36s)]
*  stop the fighting. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=854.0s)]
*  When these billions of dollars were taken off the table, Lindsey, Ukraine was viewed [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=855.48s)]
*  most likely as weak and highly vulnerable by Russia, which was not optimal from so many [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=859.66s)]
*  vantage points. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=864.62s)]
*  So both regaining access to this three point eight billion dollars in security assistance, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=865.62s)]
*  regaining access to U.S. intelligence and having the U.S. by its side as it enters negotiations [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=871.3s)]
*  is going to be quite significant, both in terms of the situation on the ground in Ukraine, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=877.4599999999999s)]
*  trying to hold territory, as well as walking into negotiations with the Russians on an [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=883.86s)]
*  actual ceasefire proposal. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=888.58s)]
*  So Sam, we know that the statement from the U.S. and Ukraine includes a snippet saying [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=890.98s)]
*  that each side, both delegations agreed to name their negotiating teams and immediately [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=896.38s)]
*  begin negotiations toward an enduring peace. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=901.98s)]
*  So this is an initial proposal and a step, but it appears to me that there is still quite [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=904.46s)]
*  a long way to go before we actually have a lasting 30 day ceasefire. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=909.82s)]
*  There is a huge amount of runway between where we are today and a lasting 30 day ceasefire. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=914.6s)]
*  However, absent this step and getting the Ukrainians on board and getting security assistance [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=919.48s)]
*  restarted and intelligence sharing restarted, we'd have an even longer runway. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=924.48s)]
*  So I don't want to minimize the importance of this moment. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=928.96s)]
*  I do want to stress when we think about getting the Russians on board and getting them, not [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=932.08s)]
*  just to name negotiators, that part is easy. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=937.52s)]
*  I've dealt with the Russians on negotiations on various things, but getting them to show [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=939.6s)]
*  up in a way where they're really ready to talk substantively is going to take a lot [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=943.5200000000001s)]
*  of behind the scenes work. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=948.5600000000001s)]
*  It's going to involve, most likely, if the administration is willing, a mixture of pressure, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=950.2s)]
*  threats of additional sanctions and other punitive measures of Russia doesn't come [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=955.8000000000001s)]
*  forward, as well as a strong vision of what the peace could look like. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=961.6800000000001s)]
*  So both positive and negative leverage being pulled here, but that's going to take a lot [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=967.6800000000001s)]
*  of backchanneling with the Russians that will likely play out behind the cameras to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=972.32s)]
*  get them to show up in a meaningful way. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=976.24s)]
*  And remember, Russia broke two ceasefires already in Ukraine since the conflict started. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=977.7600000000001s)]
*  So it's not just getting them to show up to the table, but getting them to show up in [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=983.12s)]
*  a way where they're actually committed to a lasting ceasefire. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=986.72s)]
*  Sam, Secretary Rubio was asked why the minerals deal wasn't signed today. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=990.12s)]
*  Give us a little bit of background on that. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=994.88s)]
*  Also, the secretary said that that was not the subject of today's talks. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=996.5600000000001s)]
*  It says it's still important, but today's mission was in pursuit of peace. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1002.16s)]
*  Does that surprise you? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1005.9200000000001s)]
*  It surprises me a bit, but more from the Ukrainian perspective. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1008.24s)]
*  This critical minerals deal would involve the United States having a stake in the development, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1011.36s)]
*  really, of critical minerals in Ukraine and having, most likely, some kind of actual presence [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1018.48s)]
*  as part of the development of those minerals. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1024.24s)]
*  Which the administration has touted as its own kind of security guarantee, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1026.32s)]
*  because if the United States has a vested interest in Ukraine's critical minerals development, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  then the Russians would read that the United States was committed to Ukraine's stability [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1036.0s)]
*  and security. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1040.8799999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainians have asked for more explicit security guarantees from the United States. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1042.08s)]
*  But this critical minerals deal was viewed as a first step, as a very nice thing to have. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1048.32s)]
*  I would have expected that getting this deal signed quickly would have been something that [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1054.24s)]
*  the Ukrainians would have wanted and something that the administration would have wanted, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1059.1999999999998s)]
*  because Trump has also viewed this critical minerals deal as a way to get paid back [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1062.8799999999999s)]
*  for the almost $200 billion or so in security assistance that the United States has already [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1069.76s)]
*  provided to Ukraine. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1074.72s)]
*  I'm surprised that the Ukrainians didn't view signing this deal as a measure of a security [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1076.6399999999999s)]
*  guarantee, and I'm surprised that the Trump administration didn't want to get this agreement [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1082.08s)]
*  penned as soon as possible so that Trump could say that he will be paid, that the U.S. will be paid [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  back for the security assistance we've already provided. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1093.04s)]
*  But Rubio and Walz did indicate that Besson, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, could sign [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1095.9199999999998s)]
*  this deal relatively quickly. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1102.24s)]
*  And Sam, then there's the whole Europe above it all. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1105.1999999999998s)]
*  We know that Europe was left scrambling after some of the administration's moves in pausing [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1107.4399999999998s)]
*  Ukraine, pausing intelligence, with Ukraine stepping up their own contributions and not [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1112.8s)]
*  only their own defense spending, but aid to Ukraine as well. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1118.0s)]
*  We know that they've had emergency meetings and summits, which President Zelensky has been a part [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1121.6s)]
*  of. So where did today's developments leave our European allies? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1127.12s)]
*  I think today's developments have left our European allies in exactly the same place, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1133.04s)]
*  Lindsay. This is not their first time dealing with the Trump administration, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1138.56s)]
*  nor dealing with Vladimir Putin. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1142.48s)]
*  And what I mean by that is, President Trump could change his mind on these matters quite quickly. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1144.24s)]
*  And what's important is ensuring that the Ukrainians have the support that they need [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1150.96s)]
*  so that Vladimir Putin can't march further into not just Ukraine, but into Ukraine and then [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1156.48s)]
*  elsewhere into Europe. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1161.28s)]
*  So I would imagine that the Europeans will remain committed to the increases in defense [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1162.88s)]
*  spending that they've announced overall, as well as increased support to Ukraine, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1168.32s)]
*  because they no longer view U.S. assistance to Ukraine as non-negotiable for any U.S. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1173.1200000000001s)]
*  administration. At the same time, they also know that Vladimir Putin is not exactly a [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1180.0s)]
*  trustworthy interlocutor. So this deal could fall apart for reasons wholly unrelated to Ukraine, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1186.08s)]
*  and completely related to Vladimir Putin. But Trump could choose to blame the Ukrainians for [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1192.72s)]
*  that, could withdraw support. So for all of those reasons, the Europeans will more than likely [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1197.76s)]
*  remain committed to enhanced defense spending and enhanced security assistance to Ukraine while [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1203.68s)]
*  these negotiations are ongoing. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1209.04s)]
*  And maybe even committing to putting peacekeeping troops in Ukraine, right? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1210.72s)]
*  They might. You raise a great point, Lindsay, because the Europeans have previously said [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1215.92s)]
*  both the French President Macron and Prime Minister Starr have discussed as well the [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1222.16s)]
*  presence of about 30,000 European boots on the ground peacekeeping forces as a security [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1228.64s)]
*  guarantee for Ukraine. It has been a sticking point for the Ukrainians that the United States [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1236.8000000000002s)]
*  was not willing to commit forces to that peacekeeping mission, which is why President [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1242.88s)]
*  Zelensky has been very focused on getting some other kind of security guarantee from the United [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  States so that if Putin violates any ceasefire agreement, he knows he's not just messing with [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1256.24s)]
*  the Europeans, but also directly messing with U.S. troops and U.S. national security interests. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1263.6799999999998s)]
*  So the Europeans likely remain committed to putting boots on the ground. The United States [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1269.84s)]
*  still is not willing to do so, but that largely also means that at some juncture, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1275.92s)]
*  the Europeans are going to have to be brought into these negotiations to ensure that what they've [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1282.48s)]
*  promised before is still on the table and that they're ready to implement it. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1288.0s)]
*  Sam Benigar, we certainly appreciate all of your expertise in breaking this down for us. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1291.76s)]
*  These tremendous developments here. Thank you for your time. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJbAs4n2r08&t=1296.0800000000002s)]
