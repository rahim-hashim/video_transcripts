# What does Trump's Education Department executive order actually do?
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI)
*  And questions remain about the impact of President Trump's executive order shrinking the Department of Education. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, he signed it yesterday. As you see here, surrounded by children. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=6.0s)]
*  Trump acknowledged only Congress, though, can abolish the agency. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=10.0s)]
*  Secretary of Education Linda McMahon says she aims to redistribute her department's duties to other agencies. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=14.0s)]
*  We did it thoughtfully. We looked to see where duplication was in the departments. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=21.0s)]
*  We wanted to make sure that we were just cutting fat from the bureaucracy, the inward-facing things, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=27.0s)]
*  not the outward-facing servicing that we do to students and to states. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=33.0s)]
*  So we did it very carefully. We wanted to make sure that we complied by the law. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=38.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, quote, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=42.0s)]
*  the Trump administration is determined to take a chainsaw to public education, end quote. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=46.0s)]
*  He went on to say shutting down the department will harm millions of children, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=51.0s)]
*  their families and hardworking teachers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=55.0s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Senior White House correspondent, Weijia Zhang. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=58.0s)]
*  Weijia, good morning to you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=61.0s)]
*  What else are we hearing from the White House since the president signed this order on exactly what it does? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=62.0s)]
*  Good morning, Errol, and good morning to everybody. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=70.0s)]
*  Well, we interviewed Secretary McMahon, who said that she was going to work as quickly as possible [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=72.0s)]
*  to follow the president's orders to dismantle the department. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=78.0s)]
*  You're right, Errol. The reality is that this EO does not do much in practice [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=82.0s)]
*  because both McMahon and the president himself acknowledged that it would take an act of Congress [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=87.0s)]
*  to shut down the department immediately. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=92.0s)]
*  And until that happens, they say core functions like handling student loans [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=94.0s)]
*  or making sure students with disabilities have protections [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=101.0s)]
*  and controlling funding for students from low-income families, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=105.0s)]
*  all of that is going to stay in the department. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=108.0s)]
*  Of course, the ultimate goal is to reshuffle it to other agencies. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=111.0s)]
*  But even though they are going to retain those responsibilities, Errol, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=116.0s)]
*  critics from school districts across the country say there is a real concern that funding will be limited. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=120.0s)]
*  Obviously, the work staff has been cut by 50 percent. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=127.0s)]
*  And there are concerns there's going to be lags in service, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=132.0s)]
*  especially for those special needs students, Errol. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=135.0s)]
*  And we are looking forward. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=138.0s)]
*  The president says this begins the process of eliminating the education department once and for all. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=140.0s)]
*  And as we've alluded to, you need an act of Congress to do that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=146.0s)]
*  Is that likely? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=150.0s)]
*  I mean, frankly, no, because the votes are not there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=152.0s)]
*  In the Senate, they're going to need 60 votes at least, which means support from Democrats. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=155.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's very, very unlikely to happen. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=161.0s)]
*  And I asked the secretary about this, saying, since that's true, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=164.0s)]
*  is this just a big political statement so the president can fulfill a campaign promise? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=168.0s)]
*  And she said, no, this is a commitment to trying. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=173.0s)]
*  And so she herself said she will be lobbying members of Congress [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=177.0s)]
*  because she really wants them to serve as a, quote, partner. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=180.0s)]
*  She's going to try to convince members to get on board with shutting down the department [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=183.0s)]
*  because she makes the argument that everything should really go back to the states. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=188.0s)]
*  They are closer to the children. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=192.0s)]
*  They think that will have a bigger impact. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=194.0s)]
*  But, Errol, it is going to be a tough sell. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=196.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=199.0s)]
*  Weijia, thank you for that. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LHkHxN0WHI&t=200.0s)]
