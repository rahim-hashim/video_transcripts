# What's next for a Russia-Ukraine deal as talks continue in Saudi Arabia?
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM)
*  Our monitors take us to Saudi Arabia where you can see the Russian delegation arrive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=0.0s)]
*  for ceasefire talks with the United States. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=5.68s)]
*  Negotiators held separate talks with the Ukrainians, but at the same time both Russia and Ukraine [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=8.48s)]
*  continued to launch attacks across their borders. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=15.52s)]
*  Russia launched drones across Ukraine overnight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=18.84s)]
*  Ukrainian officials say at least seven people were killed. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=22.12s)]
*  We are now joined by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner who is live in Riyadh for us [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=25.76s)]
*  today. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=31.48s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  What can we expect to come out of these talks happening today in Saudi Arabia? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  So over the last 24 hours the US delegation here has been talking first to the Ukrainians, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=42.8s)]
*  then to the Russians and soon they will be talking again to the Ukrainians. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=48.2s)]
*  They're kind of shuttling between them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  These talks are taking place in a very grand and opulent palace called the Ritz-Carlton [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=53.88s)]
*  in the centre of Riyadh and that is where the Russians are on a different floor from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=58.84s)]
*  the Ukrainians. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=65.92s)]
*  Obviously they're being kept apart. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=66.92s)]
*  The talks are focusing primarily on the Black Sea, the shipping lanes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=69.68s)]
*  Russia would like a deal there. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=75.68s)]
*  It wants to be able to revive a previous deal that allowed it to export some of its farm [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=77.48s)]
*  produce and fertilisers and Ukraine of course would like to be able to export its grain. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=82.84s)]
*  They're also looking at protecting energy infrastructure. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=88.84s)]
*  So the people at these talks, these are not big household names. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=91.92s)]
*  Steve Whitcock for example, President Trump's special envoy is not here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=95.2s)]
*  Instead the US delegation is led by Andrew Peek from the National Security Council and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=100.2s)]
*  also somebody very senior from the State Department. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainians are headed by the defence minister and he's brought with him naval experts to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=108.96s)]
*  talk about shipping lanes and mines and he's also brought with him energy experts. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  The Russians have brought somebody who is an advisor to the FSB head, the former KGB. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=119.8s)]
*  Make that what you will. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=126.16s)]
*  Frank, I want to go back to what you mentioned earlier. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=127.16s)]
*  You talked about the Black Sea. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=130.4s)]
*  Why is this so important to a deal here? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=132.44s)]
*  Well, Ukraine has been making a lot of inroads on Russia in the Black Sea. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=138.92s)]
*  I mean it's extraordinary for a country that doesn't really have a proper navy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine has largely won the battle of the Black Sea. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=149.32s)]
*  They have driven the Russian navy out of the western part of the Black Sea. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=152.67999999999998s)]
*  Russia originally planned to launch an amphibious marine sort of commando style raid on Odessa. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=157.16s)]
*  They're not able to do that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=163.6s)]
*  Uncrewed subsea and on the surface vessels, vehicles have absolutely decimated parts of [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=165.6s)]
*  the Russian fleet and so Russia has got a vested interest in trying to stop these attacks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=173.88s)]
*  They would like to see a ceasefire in the Black Sea. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  It's in their interests. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=182.76s)]
*  What the Russians are not prepared to talk about is stopping the conflict on land because [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=184.16s)]
*  they are not exactly winning because they're losing up to a thousand casualties every day [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=188.84s)]
*  but they are pushing the Ukrainians slowly back. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=194.12s)]
*  So President Putin thinks he's on a bit of a roll there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=197.12s)]
*  He doesn't want to slow down there. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=200.08s)]
*  But for now these are limited goals. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=202.24s)]
*  It's perfectly possible that, Muga, that by the end of today we could see a statement [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=204.84s)]
*  announcing a partial breakthrough and that at least would be progress that they can build on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=209.96s)]
*  Right, progress indeed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  I want to ask you about Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=216.96s)]
*  Why are these conversations happening in Saudi Arabia? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, the Saudis have got the facilities to host these things but they are primarily, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=224.08s)]
*  they see themselves as friends to both sides. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=231.4s)]
*  I don't know if you remember years ago, back in 2018, there was that grisly murder of that [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=238.48000000000002s)]
*  The CIA concluded that in all likelihood the Saudi Crown Prince was implicit, implicated [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  in some way, which he denies. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=247.24s)]
*  But the Western world largely shunned him. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=250.04000000000002s)]
*  There was a G20 meeting soon after that in Argentina. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  Guess who high-fived him? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=256.24s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=258.24s)]
*  He's not forgotten that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=259.44s)]
*  So the Saudis have got good relations with the Russians and also pretty good relations [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  with the Ukrainians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=265.44s)]
*  So it's a natural fit, really, for Saudi Arabia to be hosting these talks. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=266.68s)]
*  And I don't think these will be the last. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=271.56s)]
*  I think there will be some more here. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=272.8s)]
*  Some very important context there. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=275.0s)]
*  Thank you so much, BBC Security correspondent, Frank Gardner. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=276.76s)]
*  Appreciate your time today. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c2I2m7muYM&t=279.88s)]
