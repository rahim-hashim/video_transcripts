# Judge says Trump administration "evaded its obligations" in deportation case
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=0.0s)]
*  Federal District Judge said this afternoon the federal government, meaning the Trump [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=2.0s)]
*  Justice Department, quote, evaded its obligations, unquote, to answer that judge's questions [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=5.04s)]
*  about deportation fights involving undocumented Venezuelans in our country sent to El Salvador. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=10.68s)]
*  I want to bring in our legal panel, Tom Dupree and Jessica Levinson. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=16.0s)]
*  Tom served as the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department, and Jessica [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=19.0s)]
*  is a well-known and much-treasured CBS News contributor and professor at the Loyola Law [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=23.52s)]
*  School in Los Angeles. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=28.64s)]
*  So Tom, I want to start with you because as Scott McFarland outlined at this desk a few [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=30.76s)]
*  moments ago, this is about an immigration situation, but it is also about a larger conflict [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=35.82s)]
*  between the administration and the federal judiciary with words like defiance, failure [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=43.08s)]
*  to live up to obligations, and possibly ignoring something that the administration disagrees [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=49.46s)]
*  with, and while it ignores it, trying to create a political atmosphere where impeachment and [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  other kinds of things are suggested. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=60.48s)]
*  That's right. There's a lot going on here, and I don't think we've quite crossed the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  line into constitutional crisis yet, but we are in what I would say is a constitutional [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=65.8s)]
*  showdown. And it really gets to one of the fundamental questions under our structure [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=70.48s)]
*  of government. Basically, how much authority does the president have to unilaterally conduct [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=73.96s)]
*  these removal operations? In the view of the administration, the statute that he's acting [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=78.68s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act, which is an old statute, hasn't really been invoked since [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=83.22s)]
*  World War II, but it's still on the books. And in the president's view, he is lawfully [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=87.08s)]
*  exercising his authority and is not subject to pretty much any sort of judicial scrutiny [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=91.3s)]
*  or review. Judge Boasburn appears to see it a little differently. I think he's still wrestling [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=96.72s)]
*  a little bit with precisely what his role is, but at a minimum, he's asked the Justice [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=101.78s)]
*  Department a series of questions that, in his words, the department has evaded, at least [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=105.5s)]
*  for now. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=109.88s)]
*  Jessica, those who represent the interests of these deported Venezuelans say, look, at [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=110.66s)]
*  least prove in court that they're members of this gang. And the administration seems [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  less interested in that, like providing actual evidence. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=121.14s)]
*  Well, that's right. And that's partly based on the language of the statute that you were [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=124.58s)]
*  just talking about, this very old 18th century statute, the Aliens Enemies Act, where I think [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=129.82s)]
*  there's some question as to how much you have to prove. Now, they're looking at a portion [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=135.3s)]
*  of that statute that is triggered not in wartime, but in the situation where you have an invasion [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=141.58s)]
*  or a, quote, predatory incursion. And I think there's some question, frankly, about how [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=148.46s)]
*  much proof you really need in order to trigger the statute. But you were talking about something [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  also, which I think is really important, is not whether the Trump administration can use [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=160.9s)]
*  the statute, because the judge said, pause, wait one second, we'll sort this out. And [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  the argument we're dealing with now is whether or not the Trump administration really did [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=172.70000000000002s)]
*  pause. And specifically, the argument is the Trump administration won't come forward with [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=176.9s)]
*  evidence indicating whether or not they followed the judge's order. I love Tom's comment that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=182.14000000000001s)]
*  this is a showdown, but not yet a crisis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=187.22s)]
*  And this really goes to designated powers of the president, which are in many cases [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=190.02s)]
*  vast. The economist, as it so frequently does, I think, has encapsulated this. And the control [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=195.22s)]
*  room is going to be very angry with me because we don't have a graphic, so just listen to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=200.3s)]
*  me. I'm going to read from what the economist wrote today. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=203.42000000000002s)]
*  What Mr. Trump appears to be claiming is the right to designate people as gang members [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  on what evidence is unclear and send them to be locked up in a country where torture [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=211.34s)]
*  is common and gang suspects can be held indefinitely without trial. You don't have to be a tattooed [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=216.34s)]
*  Venezuelan, so writes the economist, to be worried by the suspension of habeas corpus. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=223.57999999999998s)]
*  Break that down, Tom. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  Sure. Well, look, far be it above me to quibble with the economist, which generally is right [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=229.42s)]
*  in most things. And look, I think the point they're making here is a fair one, is that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  the consequences for these individuals is unquestionably severe. They've been removed [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=237.18s)]
*  from the United States and placed in very oppressive conditions, to say the least. But [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=240.34s)]
*  I think the question is, is whether the administration is properly asserting its authority. And to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=244.86s)]
*  Jessica's point, the president can exercise this authority, provided that we're in a state [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=251.66000000000003s)]
*  of war or if there's some sort of invasion. And so I think the legal question here may [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=256.26s)]
*  boil down to whether or not you basically have to take the president at his word when [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  he says that in the view of the administration, we're either in a war situation or an invasion [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=265.1s)]
*  situation, and he can properly invoke that authority. And whether that determination [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=269.14s)]
*  is something that a judge can look at or second guess. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=273.62s)]
*  And Jessica, anyone who is in this country illegally can be deported. That's a fact. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=276.1s)]
*  Anyone who is a criminal in this country can be deported. And even more rapidly, there [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=281.62s)]
*  are other procedures by which to carry this out. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=285.7s)]
*  There are, but this particular statute reduces a lot of those procedures or that process. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=289.46s)]
*  And this is something that- [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  Which may be why the administration is using it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think that's exactly right. And I think that's why we have seen for a while [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=299.29999999999995s)]
*  now that one, the president laid the groundwork by saying that this Venezuelan gang was a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=304.26s)]
*  group of foreign terrorists, that it should be designated as foreign terrorists. Two, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=309.34s)]
*  you see in the executive orders, the administration since inauguration day has been using words [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=313.5s)]
*  like invasion and predatory incursion. Again, laying the groundwork for using the statute, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=319.21999999999997s)]
*  which in my mind makes it much easier to deport people if you can point to them and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=324.94s)]
*  say it's a predatory incursion, they pose a national security risk. I'm paraphrasing [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=330.26s)]
*  the statute on that part. And therefore we don't have to go through all that timely and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=336.02s)]
*  resource heavy process. We can say, here's the plan. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=342.42s)]
*  Tom, it feels as so many of these situations do right now, as if the administration, the [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=346.22s)]
*  Justice Department under President Trump, is spoiling for a fight before the Supreme [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=351.7s)]
*  Court. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=354.78s)]
*  They are. Look, I think that they realize that this question ultimately is going to [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=355.78s)]
*  migrate upwards. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  Has to. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  Certainly to the Court of Appeals and very possibly to the Supreme Court. And look, I [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=361.53999999999996s)]
*  agree with Jessica's point that the reason the administration is invoking the statute [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=365.06s)]
*  is precisely because the ordinary process of removing illegal aliens is long and cumbersome. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=368.5s)]
*  I know that. I've litigated these cases in the Justice Department. It can take years [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=373.53999999999996s)]
*  one of these cases for a single individual. And the statute that the president is acting [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=378.54s)]
*  under now is the precise other end of the spectrum. It enables him to round up people [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  en masse and get them out of the country within a matter of hours, you know, maybe days. Much [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=387.3s)]
*  faster, much more streamlined, much different. That's why they're invoking this authority. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=392.06s)]
*  And this is an early test case. If this gets through and passes judicial muster, I suspect [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=396.06s)]
*  they won't hesitate to use it again. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=400.46000000000004s)]
*  Which is why civil libertarians are nervous. Not necessarily about people who are part [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=402.02000000000004s)]
*  of this Venezuelan prison gang, but others who might fall under declared powers of the [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=406.54s)]
*  executive branch. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=411.18s)]
*  Well, look, any time the president is exercising powerful muscular authority, as Trump is doing [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=412.18s)]
*  here, there's the question of what role, if any, do judges have to play in supervising [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=416.74s)]
*  that authority? And we're going to find out the answer one way or the other pretty soon. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=420.9s)]
*  Tom Dupree is also much treasured. You've heard why. So is Jessica Levinson. Thank you [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=423.74s)]
*  both very much. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_qCOx3bUgk&t=427.74s)]
