# Trump denies Elon Musk will be briefed on China war plan during Pentagon visit
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64)
*  And we begin this morning with senior advisor to the president, Elon Musk, who is set to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=0.0s)]
*  visit the Pentagon today. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says it's, quote, an informal [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=4.76s)]
*  meeting about innovation, efficiencies, and smarter production. But last night, President [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=10.18s)]
*  Trump took to his social media platform to slam reports from the New York Times that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=15.08s)]
*  Musk's visit would actually include a briefing on a potential war with China. The president [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=19.88s)]
*  called the story ridiculous, adding China won't even be mentioned or discussed. CBS [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=25.14s)]
*  News correspondent Natalie Brand is following this story from the White House this morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=30.42s)]
*  Natalie, good morning to you. Tell us more about why Musk is visiting DOD HQ. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=34.18s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. Well, as you noted, the defense secretary on social media described [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=40.82s)]
*  this as an informal meeting on innovation, efficiencies and production. Not, he says, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  top secret war plans going on to deny reporting by the New York Times. This follows a report [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=52.58s)]
*  that was published last night that Musk was scheduled to be briefed on U.S. military plans [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=60.18s)]
*  for any war that might break out with China. Those would be top secret military operational [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=68.42s)]
*  plans. The New York Times citing two U.S. officials. But hours, hours after that report [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  was published, the president took to social media saying China will not even be mentioned [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=80.78s)]
*  or discussed. And Musk, adding on to that statement by the president on X said, quote, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=86.61999999999999s)]
*  he looks forward to the prosecutions of those at the Pentagon who are leaking maliciously [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=94.14s)]
*  false information to the New York Times. He said now the New York Times noted that if that briefing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  happened or were to take place, that would signify an extensive expansion of Musk's already [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=105.98s)]
*  expansive role as an adviser, as well as raise raise questions about potential conflicts of [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  interest given his business dealings. But aside from this New York Times report, we know that [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=121.18s)]
*  Musk and Doge have been looking into the Pentagon and proposing different ways to cut cutting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=127.94s)]
*  contracts. For instance, that's something that Hegseth himself has talked about publicly on [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=135.22s)]
*  social media. And note, Errol, Defense Secretary Hegseth and the president are scheduled to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=140.54s)]
*  speak in the Oval Office later this morning. So we will have to wait and see whether they [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=146.42s)]
*  take questions from reporters on this topic. Yeah, so much happening there. There's another [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=151.42s)]
*  big headline I want to ask you about, Natalie, a federal judge blocking the White House [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=156.46s)]
*  Department of Government efficiency from certain Social Security systems. Which one is exactly? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=160.46s)]
*  Yeah, this has raised a lot of questions and concern by people about Doge having access to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=167.58s)]
*  personal information of millions of Americans. So last night, this federal judge temporarily [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=173.86s)]
*  blocked for now Doge's access to systems in within the Social Security Administration [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=180.1s)]
*  containing sensitive information. The order not only blocks access, but also requires them to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=187.94s)]
*  delete any personal information that had been obtained that was not redacted or any, you know, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=194.7s)]
*  information that was personally identifiable. We're talking about, you know, Social Security [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=200.62s)]
*  numbers, tax information, deeply sensitive information. The judge in her ruling said, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=206.94s)]
*  to be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste and mismanagement in the S.S.A. is in the public [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=212.66s)]
*  interest, but that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so, according to the judge [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=218.82s)]
*  in this ruling. Now we'll have to wait and see how the Trump administration responds, whether they [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=226.42s)]
*  try to appeal this. As we know, Doge has said that it's looking for any waste. We know that Musk has [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=231.3s)]
*  made various claims about the Social Security administration, even calling it, quote, you know, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=238.06s)]
*  a Ponzi scheme. This, as you know, President Trump has said that he aims to protect these [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=244.9s)]
*  benefits for Americans. Errol. All right, Natalie Brand at the White House. Natalie, thanks. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4CcNjPr64&t=252.54s)]
