# What to know about appeals hearing on Trump use of Alien Enemies Act
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY)
*  Venezuela is once again accepting flights carrying Venezuelan migrants deported from the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=0.0s)]
*  after the two countries reached a repatriation agreement. U.S. officials say the first flight [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=5.2s)]
*  landed early this morning carrying nearly 200 deportees, including some alleged members of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=10.08s)]
*  the Tren de Agua gang. Earlier this month, the Trump administration invoked a rarely used [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  18th century law to deport several hundred Venezuelans to El Salvador, claiming they were [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=20.64s)]
*  gang members as well. An appeals court hearing is underway in Washington right now over the use of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=26.08s)]
*  that act. I want to bring in CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=31.119999999999997s)]
*  Camilo, what do we know about the appeals court hearing? Hi Lindsay, this high stakes hearing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=36.0s)]
*  over the use of the Alien Enemies Act by the Trump administration is still ongoing before three [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  federal judges here in Washington D.C. but we have heard already arguments from the Justice Department [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=47.28s)]
*  lawyer representing the Trump administration and he is essentially arguing to these federal judges [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=53.2s)]
*  that the lower court judge who blocked the president's proclamation is essentially second [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=59.36s)]
*  guessing the president's authority over national security and immigration policy. He called the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=65.2s)]
*  order by the lower court judge utterly unprecedented but one of the circuit appellate judges said that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=71.84s)]
*  the policy itself, the proclamation by the president, Lindsay, is itself also unprecedented [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=78.24s)]
*  as we have talked about before. This is the first time that the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=84.88s)]
*  is invoked during peacetime, not when the country is actively at war, and it is the first time that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=90.64s)]
*  it is now being invoked against nationals, migrants of a country that the U.S. is not currently at war [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  with and so this is a really unprecedented case. We'll see what the federal appeals court rules [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=102.72s)]
*  but as we know Venezuela is already sending some planes to the U.S. to prevent their citizens or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=108.72s)]
*  nationals from being sent to countries like El Salvador and to be imprisoned there. Camilo, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=114.56s)]
*  CBS News has confirmed the Internal Revenue Service is working with immigration officials to come to [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=120.08s)]
*  an agreement on sharing tax data to help locate undocumented migrants they're trying to deport. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=124.48s)]
*  Can you explain that for us? What the impact would it be and do you expect that would be challenged? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=130.0s)]
*  We can report here at CBS News, Lindsay, that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the IRS [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=134.56s)]
*  are currently in the process of forging an agreement that would allow ICE deportation agents to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=140.39999999999998s)]
*  obtain some IRS data and databases on suspected immigrants who are in the country illegally, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=146.95999999999998s)]
*  specifically data and information related to so-called ITIN numbers and these are numbers that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=156.0s)]
*  are used by undocumented immigrants and other non-citizens to file taxes because they are not [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=162.4s)]
*  eligible, Lindsay, for social security numbers unlike U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=168.64s)]
*  How that information is used is obviously the million dollar question but of course the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=175.6s)]
*  chair administration, as you know, is in the process of fulfilling that promise by the president [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=180.72s)]
*  to conduct the largest deportation operation in American history and it has been trying to expand [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=186.48s)]
*  the pool of people that it can arrest and deport from the country and obviously this seems like an [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=193.28s)]
*  effort to locate even more people who are in the country unlawfully and who can be deported as part [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=199.68s)]
*  of that deportation operation, Lindsay. Okay, Camilo Montoya Galvez, thank you so much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE2HplmQ_EY&t=205.6s)]
