# Powerful 7.7-magnitude earthquake hits Myanmar
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU)
*  Good morning everyone, I'm Errol Barnett at the CBS broadcast center here in New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=0.0s)]
*  City. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=5.16s)]
*  We begin this hour with breaking news out of Asia. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=6.16s)]
*  A powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake has just rocked central Myanmar a number of hours ago, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  and it's at this early stage that we can report at least three confirmed deaths. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=16.64s)]
*  That number is expected to rise. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=22.04s)]
*  Now, at this moment, you're looking at some of the footage coming into our newsroom right [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=24.32s)]
*  now, the full scale of damage is still unknown, but an official in the country has told the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  AFP news agency that a major hospital in Myanmar's capital is now a, quote, mass casualty area. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=34.6s)]
*  Now the U.S. geological survey says the powerful quake struck at around 1.20 p.m. local time, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=42.8s)]
*  so early afternoon, at a depth of just six miles, which is relatively shallow, and it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=49.2s)]
*  sent tremors causing damage hundreds of miles away in Bangkok. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=55.2s)]
*  That footage you're seeing at the top left of your screen is from Bangkok, a high-rise [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=60.2s)]
*  building there that was under construction collapse, reportedly trapping at least 43 [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=65.64s)]
*  workers who were on site at the time. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  Now rescue workers are currently reporting that the rubble at that construction site [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=75.04s)]
*  is just too unstable to attempt any type of rescue efforts for workers who are likely [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=80.28s)]
*  trapped inside at this moment. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=85.92s)]
*  Now strong tremors have also been felt in China. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=88.16s)]
*  An aftershock has just been reported with a magnitude of 6.4. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=91.36s)]
*  That in and of itself is quite powerful, and we will be connecting with our correspondents [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=96.48s)]
*  in the region soon, and we'll bring you an update from them later this hour. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=102.0s)]
*  So that breaking news out of Asia that a powerful 7.7 earthquake has just hit Myanmar. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE6Z5tXEWjU&t=107.08s)]
