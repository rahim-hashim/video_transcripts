# Elon Musk meets with senior officials at Pentagon
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0)
*  Ivan Musk visited the Pentagon Friday for a briefing and meeting with Defense Secretary [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=0.0s)]
*  Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=4.32s)]
*  Musk has been overseeing an effort to help President Trump shrink the government, including [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=5.88s)]
*  the Defense Department. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=9.14s)]
*  During a press conference at the Oval Office, President Trump denied reports that Musk received [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=10.14s)]
*  a briefing about the U.S. military's defense plans when it comes to China. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=14.4s)]
*  We don't want to have a potential war with China, but I can tell you if we did, we're [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=19.42s)]
*  very well equipped to handle it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=22.56s)]
*  But I don't want to show that to anybody. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=24.6s)]
*  But certainly you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=26.0s)]
*  But I certainly wouldn't want, you know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=30.88s)]
*  perhaps to that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=36.24s)]
*  U.S. officials say the meeting was intended to be unclassified. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=38.44s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth says Musk was also the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=41.56s)]
*  or DOJ, visited the Pentagon to talk about efficiencies and innovations. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=46.08s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News senior national security correspondent Charlie Daggett. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Charlie, what more are we learning about the meeting? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=54.04s)]
*  Well, first of all, Lindsay, the official line is just that. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=55.84s)]
*  Elon Musk came to the Pentagon today to discuss DOJ, efficiency and innovations. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  And I can confirm, Elon Musk came here at around 9 o'clock. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=64.68s)]
*  He left at 10.20. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=67.88s)]
*  He met with Defense Secretary Hegseth upstairs. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=69.12s)]
*  On leaving, he offered to help in any way he can, in his words. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=72.48s)]
*  So he wouldn't say what was discussed when asked. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  But the controversy came when reports emerged that Musk was going to sit in on top secret [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=77.6s)]
*  meetings regarding China. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=82.44000000000001s)]
*  So even before he arrived, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said Musk's meeting was never [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=84.04s)]
*  going to be about China. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  He's very forceful about it, even going so far as to demand the New York Times retract [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=90.76s)]
*  their story. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=95.2s)]
*  And that story suggested that he would be privy to what the military calls O-plans or [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=96.2s)]
*  operational plans, which would include things like where and when to go after Chinese military [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  targets. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=107.68s)]
*  If that type of briefing on China were to happen, why would it be so problematic? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=109.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, Lindsay, this is where it gets murky, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=112.6s)]
*  So as I said, officially here to discuss innovation and technology, he has multiple defense contracts, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=116.0s)]
*  including SpaceX, worth billions of taxpayer dollars. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=122.48s)]
*  But at the same time, he's heavily invested in China, and he has spoken favorably about [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=125.6s)]
*  China in the past. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=130.68s)]
*  So he's got skin in both here at the DOD and in China. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=131.68s)]
*  So every single source that I spoke to today said Musk did not have classified briefings [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=135.96s)]
*  on China, and as you said, President Trump and Hexseth repeated those assertions. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  So you can see the obvious conflict of interest, let alone the idea that highly classified [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=145.52s)]
*  information like that might be compromised. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  President Trump said, as he said about Musk, he would not want Musk to have access to that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  kind of information. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=159.68s)]
*  But at the same time, you can see where there'd be value in knowing that kind of information. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=160.68s)]
*  So whether or not he was originally supposed to sit in on those classified briefings, and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=165.88s)]
*  then they either modified it or changed the game after that story broke, they won't say. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=170.76s)]
*  What can you tell us about this new Air Force contract with Boeing? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=176.96s)]
*  Yeah, so the new F-47 fighter jet. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  That might just be a happy accident that it coincides with the 47th president of the United [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=185.74s)]
*  States. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=189.48s)]
*  President Trump called it a beautiful number. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=191.2s)]
*  Secretary Pete Hexseth declined to comment. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=193.8s)]
*  Obviously, it's top secret, so I can't get into it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=194.8s)]
*  Well, I don't even—I haven't even been given the classification on it, but it is—it's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  been touted as the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=205.0s)]
*  The Air Force says—and this is kind of important—so it's built to adapt, is the way they describe [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=209.36s)]
*  it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  So it's stealth, long-range capabilities. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=214.92000000000002s)]
*  It's an advancement of the F-22 fighter jet. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=216.4s)]
*  It's been called a generational step forward, and it is. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's been almost a generation since the last fighter jet was introduced. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=223.16s)]
*  But it has air-to-air combat capabilities. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  It's been developed for the past five years. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=230.6s)]
*  It was put on pause by the Biden administration in terms of revaluation and cost and relevance. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  The Air Force and Boeing have promised that that F-47 will fly during President Trump's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=241.83999999999997s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=246.72s)]
*  So, the first phase is going to be integrating, testing all aspects of it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=248.72s)]
*  There will be a small number of aircraft that will be built for evaluation, according to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=252.68s)]
*  Air Force officials I spoke to. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=257.4s)]
*  Ultimately, big price tag. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=259.32s)]
*  It's going to cost about $20 billion, each aircraft costing roughly $300 million once [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=260.92s)]
*  production is up and running. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=266.6s)]
*  Charlie, you have some reporting on a second destroyer being sent to the southern border. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=267.92s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=271.36s)]
*  Yeah, so this is a curious one. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=272.36s)]
*  We just got the information just a few minutes ago. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=275.64000000000004s)]
*  So, there's already been the USS Graveley that's been deployed to the Gulf of Mexico, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=278.40000000000003s)]
*  the president calls Gulf of America. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=285.8s)]
*  It's unique in that they don't traditionally deploy destroyers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  The Coast Guard usually keeps an eye on that area. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=293.36s)]
*  What we have now is the USS Spruance. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=297.32000000000005s)]
*  Interestingly, the USS Spruance is another Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, similar to [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=300.0s)]
*  the Graveley. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=305.8s)]
*  It's deployed out of San Diego. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=306.8s)]
*  That's its home port. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=308.76s)]
*  As part of its deployment, it will be patrolling and policing the border not far from San Diego. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=310.64s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, thanks so much. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=316.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP472eOV4G0&t=318.64s)]
