# Americans describe severe earthquake felt in Thailand
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54)
*  So video to our monitors takes us to the aftermath of two deadly earthquakes that rocked Myanmar and Thailand. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=0.0s)]
*  It happened last night. It's tragic. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=6.0s)]
*  A 7.7 magnitude quake hit central Myanmar along with several aftershocks, some of them huge aftershocks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=8.0s)]
*  Sent a lot of people running into the streets and then the emergency workers there to try to save lives. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=15.0s)]
*  So it's very early right now, but we can tell you as of this hour, 144 dead, more than 730 injured, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=20.0s)]
*  many, many more are missing. In fact, you are looking right now at the search and rescue effort underway. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=28.0s)]
*  People underneath that rubble and the rush under that building collapsed to save people in Bangkok following one of those quakes. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=34.0s)]
*  And in fact, look at this. This is a collapsed bridge and a woman showing the massive cracks in the ground that happened as a result afterwards. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=41.0s)]
*  And then take a look at this shocking moment here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=50.0s)]
*  An entire skyscraper. And here it goes tumbling to the ground, just toppling there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=53.0s)]
*  We have an opportunity to really put a human face behind the headlines. Tim and Abby Allen, our teachers from Roanoke, Virginia. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=59.0s)]
*  They moved to Thailand over a year ago to teach at an international school right outside of Bangkok. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=67.0s)]
*  Six hundred students there that they know, they love, they teach every day. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=72.0s)]
*  Let's listen to Tim Allen moments after that quake hit. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=76.0s)]
*  Holy crap. So there was just an earthquake in Bangkok and we were here at the school. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=81.0s)]
*  We got all of our students out and we're out in the open away from any buildings. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=88.0s)]
*  We were told that in a few minutes there's going to be an aftershock. It's really crazy moment to be here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=93.0s)]
*  We have an opportunity now to talk live to Tim and Abby. You are in Thailand. You are teaching from your home in Virginia. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=100.0s)]
*  First of all, we're so glad that you're OK. We saw one child in your arms. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=108.0s)]
*  What's your concern for the hundreds of students that you teach and their families at this hour? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the priority was just making sure that all of our students were out of the building and safe. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=118.0s)]
*  And our school, you know, we've had evacuation drills like this before. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=123.0s)]
*  And so the school here was super prepared. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=128.0s)]
*  The teachers were ready to go and we were able to get all of our students out of the buildings and into safety. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=131.0s)]
*  So where were you in that moment and walk us through those moments when you realize this is no small shaker? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I was actually I had a prep hour during that period and I was walking back to the building where my students were at. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=144.0s)]
*  I actually thought that it was just vertigo for a second. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=152.0s)]
*  And then some other teachers started walking out of the buildings and they were saying, you know, can you feel that? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=155.0s)]
*  And then that's when I realized like, oh, it's not just vertigo. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=160.0s)]
*  Like, we're all feeling this and it's an earthquake. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=163.0s)]
*  And so as soon as it calmed down, I pulled out my phone and I started to call my wife, who we actually live on the school campus. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=166.0s)]
*  And so she was at home with our two kids. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=173.0s)]
*  And then I took off running to check on my students to make sure that they were able to get out and get to safety. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=176.0s)]
*  And I was able to direct them onto the soccer field so that they were away from any of the buildings. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=182.0s)]
*  Well, and Abby, we know you're mindful that you are among just two of one hundred thousand or so Americans who live in that area. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=187.0s)]
*  Have you heard from the U.S. Embassy? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=195.0s)]
*  Oh, we haven't, but we have a really amazing community here on campus where we live and we were all just there for each other and helping each other out and carrying our small kids out together with all of the students as well. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=197.0s)]
*  What's the what's next for the two of you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=212.0s)]
*  I would imagine that you are going to be a part of a lot of these recovery efforts for weeks ahead. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=215.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're already involved with helping out some of the people in our community, especially the people who live just down the road from us. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=220.0s)]
*  Some of the buildings were not quite as lucky as the buildings that we have here on campus. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=229.0s)]
*  Some people who live in some of the high rise apartment buildings, they're seeing cracks that are going all the way through the building and they're being told that they may not be able to ever return to their homes in those apartments. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=233.0s)]
*  So we're looking for places to shelter them and take care of them. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=244.0s)]
*  Tim and Abby Allen, we're so glad you are OK. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=248.0s)]
*  Thank you for those heroic moments when you didn't even think of your own safety, but you thought of the kids and getting them out. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=251.0s)]
*  We're glad to hear a bright report amidst so many dark reports. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=257.0s)]
*  Thank you so much for putting a human face to the headlines here on CBS News 24 7. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AfiL3MZj54&t=260.0s)]
