# Law firms sue to stop Trump's executive orders
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os)
*  All right, a law firm that led investigations into the 2016 election is fighting back against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's new executive order that cuts federal ties with it. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=6.4s)]
*  CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarlane is joining us now live from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Washington to speak more about this. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=16.04s)]
*  Scott, help us understand exactly what these executive orders are and how exactly these [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=17.84s)]
*  law firms are fighting back. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=21.92s)]
*  Hey, Errol, the day began with a legal explosion here in Washington with two major firms filing [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=24.2s)]
*  new lawsuits as the courts opened here in Washington, challenging Trump executive orders [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=30.88s)]
*  that targeted the firms. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=35.64s)]
*  One of them is called Generon Block. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=37.18s)]
*  Together is Wilmer Hale. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=39.2s)]
*  Those sound like some very obscure companies, but these are major D.C. law firms, and the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=40.92s)]
*  impact of these lawsuits and these executive orders could impact the entire nation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=47.92s)]
*  Wilmer Hale was the subject of an executive order last night trying to strip them of their [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  ability to do business, the president arguing they are politically motivated lawyers who [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=56.36s)]
*  should have their work reduced. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=62.28s)]
*  Generon Block, different firm, same story. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=64.32s)]
*  The president says Generon Block should have its ability to function removed because he [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=67.24s)]
*  alleges that they too are politically motivated. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=71.56s)]
*  Both are suing now in federal court, Errol, calling these executive orders unlawful, First [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=74.6s)]
*  Amendment violations, and that they could have a chilling effect on law firms nationwide [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=79.64s)]
*  that want to avoid running afoul of the president, making them less inclined to take cases for [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=84.8s)]
*  people who might be challenging what the administration is doing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=89.16s)]
*  If you have trouble getting a veteran's benefit, a Social Security check, you lose your federal [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=93.0s)]
*  job or have some back pay issues, it may be hard to find a lawyer now to take up those [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=97.12s)]
*  cases because firms are being squeezed by the White House. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=101.62s)]
*  This is an impactful day in Washington as these firms try to fight back and have judges [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=106.16s)]
*  declare these executive orders unlawful. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=111.36s)]
*  And what we saw from a statement from one of those law firms, Scott, was that it's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  connected to former special counsel Robert Mueller. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=118.75999999999999s)]
*  The law firm notes that he retired from that firm back in 2021. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=121.75999999999999s)]
*  But are there wider concerns now that this executive order is out, that the president [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=126.64s)]
*  is taking retaliatory measures against firms connected in any way to anyone who might have [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=132.56s)]
*  investigated him in the past? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=140.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's also concerns, Errol, this will metastasize into other firms who have any [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=143.2s)]
*  affiliation with the firms already on this list. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=147.86s)]
*  This can be something that spreads farther and wider. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=151.6s)]
*  The president has argued that these firms have employed people who've investigated [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=154.36s)]
*  him or taken legal actions against him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=158.38s)]
*  He calls that lawfare and he thinks these executive orders are justified. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=160.7s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=165.22s)]
*  They strip security clearances from some of the lawyers or they prohibit the lawyers from [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=166.22s)]
*  going into federal buildings or getting federal clients. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  That's a death sentence for many law firms. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=173.45999999999998s)]
*  They can't survive those types of restrictions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=176.14s)]
*  Take a look at this quote to CBS News from former associate attorney general, Vanita [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=178.42s)]
*  Gupta, who tells CBS News these legal challenges being mustered by the law firms are critical [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=182.42s)]
*  if not pivotal. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=188.62s)]
*  He says the only way through this attack on the very foundations of our legal system [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=189.62s)]
*  is by fighting back. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=193.54s)]
*  If firms want to be trusted to fight the biggest fights, they must not cave to blatantly unconstitutional [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=195.08s)]
*  government actions. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  This is a broader issue, Errol, than just these law firms. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  If the administration is cracking down on law firms in general, it becomes hard to find [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=207.0s)]
*  a lawyer to challenge the federal government. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=211.66s)]
*  Remarkable updates there, Scott. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=215.1s)]
*  I want to ask you about another major development out of Washington, and that's a potential [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=216.46s)]
*  merger between the ATF and the DEA. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=221.1s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=224.98000000000002s)]
*  The ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=226.78s)]
*  a source familiar with the matter, tell CBS News there's a memo circulating inside the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=231.62s)]
*  Department of Justice about merging those two agencies into one. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=236.06s)]
*  The Trump administration and its Republican allies have been keen on cutting back the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=240.38s)]
*  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=244.9s)]
*  They've not named its own director for that agency. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=247.02s)]
*  Republicans believe that agency too often encroaches on Second Amendment rights. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=250.3s)]
*  This could be a way, Errol, of paring back the ATF and starving it of resources. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=254.14000000000001s)]
*  The reshaping of the U.S. government under President Trump. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=260.7s)]
*  Scott McFarlane with the latest for us out of our D.C. Bureau. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=263.66s)]
*  Scott, always great to chat with you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=266.38s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGw1M5273Os&t=267.58s)]
