# Deadly earthquakes rock Myanmar, Thailand
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA)
*  And a powerful earthquake has rocked parts of Asia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=0.0s)]
*  Myanmar's Sumatra government has declared a state of emergency, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=3.66s)]
*  and the Thai capital of Bangkok, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=7.16s)]
*  where people are being evacuated from buildings, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=9.16s)]
*  also felt a large portion of this powerful earthquake. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=12.16s)]
*  In fact, now we want to bring in Sebastian Wolff. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=16.0s)]
*  He was in Bangkok today when the quake hit just a few hours ago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=18.36s)]
*  Sebastian, we can see people moving about the city right next to you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=22.16s)]
*  What did it feel like, and what do things look like now where you are? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=25.96s)]
*  Yeah, good morning to all. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=31.0s)]
*  It was very, very crazy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=33.6s)]
*  It started out of nowhere. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=35.04s)]
*  The whole building was just shaking. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=36.64s)]
*  I was on the 20th floor, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=38.14s)]
*  and people started running, panicking, running out of the building. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=39.84s)]
*  I personally thought it would be safer to just stay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=44.34s)]
*  Also, the building inside looked quite sturdy. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=46.44s)]
*  I started filming immediately, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=49.64s)]
*  and then I did see the water flowing over like a waterfall [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=51.84s)]
*  in the building across the street. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=56.34s)]
*  It was just something I've never seen in my life this way. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=58.1s)]
*  This was not my first earthquake, but for sure the strongest one. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=62.54s)]
*  We were just looking at that footage, Sebastian, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=66.4s)]
*  of what seemed to be a rooftop pool [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=69.1s)]
*  with the water splashing over the edge of that high rise. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=71.04s)]
*  We're now seeing footage of a building that was under construction, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=74.5s)]
*  and footage also captured it collapsing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=78.26s)]
*  Rescue officials said they were not able to get in and rescue survivors [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=81.4s)]
*  because the rubble was so unstable. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=87.44s)]
*  Where you are, though, seems to be unaffected. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=89.67999999999999s)]
*  How widespread is the damage? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=94.48s)]
*  So here, I wouldn't say unaffected. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=97.88s)]
*  The buildings are still being checked. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=100.48s)]
*  Most buildings are evacuated. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=104.68s)]
*  I can still not go home. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=106.88s)]
*  They're checking the buildings. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=108.53999999999999s)]
*  Maybe you can hear the sirens in the background. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=110.68s)]
*  People are on the streets, but it could be worse. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=113.44s)]
*  There's not much damage visible here. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=116.24s)]
*  Some of the buildings do have damage visibly outside. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=118.88s)]
*  And the building you referenced was a building under construction [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=122.88s)]
*  that, in fact, collapsed. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=126.78s)]
*  And as far as I know, there were people inside, locals. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=129.04s)]
*  Sebastian, we so appreciate you jumping on your phone [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=132.57999999999998s)]
*  and connecting with us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=134.88s)]
*  Stand still for us so I can get a sense of what's happening around you. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=135.94s)]
*  And help me understand, you are hundreds of miles away from the epicenter. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=140.18s)]
*  But how did it feel? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=144.72s)]
*  Very strong. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=148.42s)]
*  Very, very strong. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=151.36s)]
*  I don't know how strong it was here. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=152.1s)]
*  I honestly don't know. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=154.4s)]
*  I was on the 20th floor, as I said, and it was really movement. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=156.8s)]
*  I could not stand still. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=160.76s)]
*  It was the strongest earthquake that I've ever experienced. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=162.9s)]
*  And what are you hearing as far as the activity of emergency officials, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=166.62s)]
*  first responders, ambulances, and the like? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=172.4s)]
*  Well, the ambulance I can hear in the background, what the officials say, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=177.4s)]
*  I actually don't know. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  We just got outside of the building. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  We were told and we got messages that an information that there is a second wave [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=185.24s)]
*  coming, but that never happened, but it might come at any time, obviously. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=189.9s)]
*  So for now, we're just getting dinner in a wide side street, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=194.38s)]
*  no big buildings next to us and very sweating for news, basically. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=198.20000000000002s)]
*  Sebastian Wolf, we appreciate you giving us your firsthand account. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=202.44s)]
*  Please do stay safe and stay in contact with us throughout the day. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=206.44s)]
*  Sebastian, thank you. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=210.74s)]
*  Let's cross over to CBS News foreign correspondent Anna Corrin. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=213.1s)]
*  She's following developments for us from Hong Kong. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=215.98000000000002s)]
*  Anna, this just happened a few hours ago. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=218.84s)]
*  What early information do we know about what happened in Myanmar [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  and the scale of the damage there? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=225.5s)]
*  Well, look, Errol, the reason that it was felt so strongly [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=228.28s)]
*  is because this earthquake was rather shallow, six miles deep. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  And that is why it was so violent in obviously Myanmar, in Mandalay, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  which was the epicentre of the quake, the second largest city in Myanmar, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=242.38s)]
*  home to more than a million people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=247.54s)]
*  But it was felt all the way to neighbouring Thailand and its capital, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=249.64s)]
*  Bangkok, which is obviously where Sebastian is. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=254.42s)]
*  I mean, earthquakes in Bangkok are unheard of. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=257.41999999999996s)]
*  I spoke to a friend who was there, who was on the 12th floor. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=261.41999999999996s)]
*  He said he cannot remember the last time there was an earthquake. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=265.41999999999996s)]
*  I have a relative also in Bangkok who said that the building shook [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=269.41999999999996s)]
*  violently for over a minute. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=274.41999999999996s)]
*  Once again, in Bangkok, it is unheard of. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  Myanmar, it is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=280.41999999999996s)]
*  Myanmar, it is prone to earthquakes, but not as far reaching as Bangkok. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=283.42s)]
*  And obviously the images that we have seen on social media [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=289.42s)]
*  coming out of Thailand are absolutely shocking. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=293.42s)]
*  But in Myanmar, a state of emergency has been declared. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=295.42s)]
*  The military junta, which took power, seized power in a coup in February 2021, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=299.42s)]
*  it is a closed society. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=304.42s)]
*  People cannot get in there. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=306.42s)]
*  So the fact that they are appealing for international assistance [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=307.42s)]
*  really suggests, Errol, how desperate and dire the situation is on the ground. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=312.42s)]
*  We have seen footage of mosques and temples crumbling to the ground. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=316.42s)]
*  The University of Mandalay was engulfed in flames shortly after the earthquake struck. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=321.42s)]
*  And then, of course, there was an aftershock, you know, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=328.42s)]
*  6.4 magnitude aftershock after that 7.7, 11 minutes later. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=330.42s)]
*  So many people, you know, obviously outside fearing more aftershocks. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=335.42s)]
*  This can happen, you know, for days after that initial quake. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=340.42s)]
*  But once again, as I say, the fact the military junta is appealing for international aid [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=344.42s)]
*  really suggests how bad the situation is on the ground in Myanmar. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=348.42s)]
*  That's a very good point, Anna. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=353.42s)]
*  And what you're describing is really a one-two punch for people there in Myanmar [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=355.42s)]
*  and South Asia and Southeast Asia. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=360.42s)]
*  When might we hear or see more out of Myanmar, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=362.42s)]
*  considering it is, because of the military junta, a relatively closed society? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=366.42s)]
*  We're not seeing much footage of the widespread devastation just yet, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=371.42s)]
*  but it's still early. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=376.42s)]
*  How long do you think it might take before we really get a sense of the devastation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=378.42s)]
*  at the epicenter? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=382.42s)]
*  Look, I think, Errol, once international aid organizations land on the ground, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=385.42s)]
*  and you would have to assume that that is getting underway as we speak. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=392.42s)]
*  You know, they are going to need supplies. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=397.42s)]
*  They're going to need food. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=399.42s)]
*  They're going to need accommodation or housing, tents. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=400.42s)]
*  We know in Napier Door that the hospital there is completely full. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=404.42s)]
*  I believe there are hundreds of people who have been brought to that hospital. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=412.42s)]
*  And as I say, it is going to take time for international aid crews to reach the ground [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=419.42s)]
*  over the next day or so. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=426.42s)]
*  But you would have to assume those plans are being put in place as we speak, Errol. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=428.42s)]
*  I know that we will continue to cover this breaking story with CBS Mornings [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=432.42s)]
*  at the top of the hour and throughout the day on CBS News 24-7. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=436.42s)]
*  Anna Coron with the latest for us from Hong Kong. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=440.42s)]
*  Anna, thank you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqMuhev6fNA&t=443.42s)]
