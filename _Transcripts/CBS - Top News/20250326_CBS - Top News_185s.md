# Footage shows moment ICE officials arrested Tufts University student
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q)
*  Well, let's go to Massachusetts now where a ring camera captured the moment ICE agents [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=0.0s)]
*  arrested a Tufts University graduate student. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=5.24s)]
*  We want to show you that video up close. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=8.14s)]
*  Watch the lower left corner here as authorities rather approached the young woman and handcuffed [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=10.3s)]
*  her. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=15.74s)]
*  Now this happened right outside an off-campus apartment building in Summerville, just north [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=29.22s)]
*  of Boston. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=35.14s)]
*  A lawyer for the student says she is a Muslim Turkish student with a valid student visa. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=36.14s)]
*  Let's go to our breaking news correspondent, Chanel Call, in the CBS Newsroom in New York. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=42.1s)]
*  Chanel, good to see you again today. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  That video is terrifying because when moments like that happen, you don't know who is grabbing [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=47.9s)]
*  you. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=53.14s)]
*  So can you tell us what we know right now about that arrest? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=54.14s)]
*  Yeah, and Mugo, we actually also have another angle of that scene to share with you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=57.78s)]
*  So I want to show you that video right now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=61.9s)]
*  It essentially shows six plain clothes agents handcuffing 30-year-old Rumeysa Ozturk. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=64.5s)]
*  Once we show you that video, you'll be able to see it. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=71.78s)]
*  And you can also hear the person who captured this video actually noting that most of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=74.38s)]
*  officers there were masked. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=78.74000000000001s)]
*  These Homeland Security agents, they were there, they removed her backpack, and then [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=81.82s)]
*  eventually they walked her down the street into a vehicle. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=86.1s)]
*  Now all of this happened on Tuesday evening. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=89.5s)]
*  And we should mention Ozturk is a Turkish national, also an international graduate student [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=92.22s)]
*  at Tufts University in Massachusetts. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=98.14s)]
*  Now in a petition that was filed in Boston federal court, her lawyer Mugo says that she [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  was leaving her home heading to an Iftar dinner with friends when this happened on Tuesday [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=105.82s)]
*  evening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=110.22s)]
*  Federal agents have so far not explained why she was taken from her home and detained. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=111.52s)]
*  And Chanel, here's the other part of this story that just blows my mind here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=115.98s)]
*  Lawyers for that student, they say they do not know where she is right now and have not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=119.9s)]
*  been able to contact her. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=123.9s)]
*  So do we know what's going on there? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=125.30000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I have an update with this. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=127.34s)]
*  So earlier today, Mugo, her lawyers had said, we don't know where she is, we don't know [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=129.58s)]
*  where she's being held, and we haven't been able to contact her. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  But just moments ago, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that Ozturk is now being held [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=136.62s)]
*  in a Louisiana detention center. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=142.70000000000002s)]
*  This spokesperson also says Ozturk is, quote, granted the privilege to be in this country [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=145.5s)]
*  on a visa. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=152.26000000000002s)]
*  terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=159.34s)]
*  A visa, they say, is a privilege, not a right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=163.10000000000002s)]
*  And glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans, they say, is grounds for a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=166.58s)]
*  visa issuance to be terminated. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  This, it goes on to say, is common sense security. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=174.9s)]
*  But again, no word from federal agents on if charges will be laid here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=177.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=181.58s)]
*  Okay, Chanel Cole, thank you so much for that update. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=182.58s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgCpAIe788Q&t=184.5s)]
