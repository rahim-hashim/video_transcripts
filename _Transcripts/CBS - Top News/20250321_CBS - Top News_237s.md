# Court hearing expected on mass deportation flights to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8)
*  Venezuela's interior minister says none of the more than 200 jailed deportees being held [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=0.0s)]
*  in a prison in El Salvador are members of the notorious Venezuelan gang known as Tren [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=6.8s)]
*  de Aragua. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=11.32s)]
*  CBS News was the first to obtain an internal government list that includes the names of [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=12.32s)]
*  238 men who were on those flights. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=16.4s)]
*  The White House claims they are all violent gang members, but in addition to Venezuelan [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=19.38s)]
*  officials, family members and lawyers for some of the deportees are casting doubts on [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  the validity of those claims. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  An attorney tracking the cases of the deportees says at least 44 of the individuals who appear [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=29.28s)]
*  on that list do not have criminal records in the U.S. or Venezuela. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  This afternoon, a hearing is taking place in Washington where a U.S. district judge [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=38.2s)]
*  who attempted to block the deportations under the 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=42.06s)]
*  is calling on the Trump administration to provide detailed information about last weekend's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  flights. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=51.64s)]
*  The Justice Department handed over a late court filing last night answering some of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=52.72s)]
*  questions. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=56.48s)]
*  The judge said the Justice Department evaded its obligations with a woefully insufficient [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=57.72s)]
*  response. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=62.84s)]
*  President Trump weighed in on the legal fight earlier from the Oval Office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=63.84s)]
*  We can't let a judge say that he wants him. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=67.36s)]
*  He didn't run for president. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=70.24s)]
*  He didn't get much more than 80 million votes. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=71.6s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=76.2s)]
*  It'd be so bad for our country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=77.68s)]
*  CBS News Department of Justice correspondent Scott McFarland is at the courthouse and joins [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=80.36s)]
*  us now on the phone. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=84.02s)]
*  Scott, what are we expecting from today's hearing? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=85.02s)]
*  It's going to begin in about 20 minutes, Lindsay, here at the federal court in Washington, D.C. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=86.86s)]
*  It's the one just down the street from the U.S. Capitol. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=91.34s)]
*  It's the chief judge, James Boasberg, having a hearing to update where things stand and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=93.86s)]
*  what has become a landmark standoff between the administration, the executive branch, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=99.02s)]
*  and him in the judicial branch. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=105.5s)]
*  He has issued a series of orders and he has made this claim in his orders so far that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=107.42s)]
*  those orders are being rejected or disobeyed or disregarded by the administration. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=113.28s)]
*  We'll see what he brings up with the Department of Justice here today as he seeks answers [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=118.84s)]
*  to questions about when the flights took off last Saturday, when they cleared U.S. airspace, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=122.66000000000001s)]
*  and when they landed in white. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=127.44s)]
*  His order that they turn around was not complied with. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  So multiple deadlines have been set by the judge for the administration to comply. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=133.06s)]
*  Is the administration still arguing it can withhold information via this state secrets [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=137.58s)]
*  privilege? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  That's the indication we're getting from their filings. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=143.04s)]
*  We'll see if they say so declaratively during the courthouse today, but in their latest [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  series of court filings that are public, they're indicating they're still trying to invoke [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  this state secret argument to hold the information back from the judge. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=153.55999999999997s)]
*  And that may be an argument they want to employ, but the judge has said in so many words, we [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=158.0s)]
*  have classified rooms in which you can give me this information and they will remain state [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=162.39999999999998s)]
*  secrets. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=166.83999999999997s)]
*  These things happen in court all the time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=167.83999999999997s)]
*  What's more, the Department of Justice is just missing deadlines here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=169.76s)]
*  There are timeframes they have to respond by. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=173.67999999999998s)]
*  They're not hitting their, they're not turning the assignment in as it's due. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=175.76s)]
*  And that has ruffled the feathers of the judge, and we'll see if he addresses that today, too. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  Are you getting a sense from your own reporting, from legal experts that you're talking to, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  that this case could go all the way up to the high court? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=189.54s)]
*  Sure could. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=192.56s)]
*  And there's any number of things that you could challenge here, but I think the Trump [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=193.56s)]
*  administration is keen on getting this whole issue of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  it is invoked to deport these alleged Venezuelan gang members. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=203.67999999999998s)]
*  They'd like the Supreme Court to weigh in on it so as to liberate the Trump administration [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=207.28s)]
*  to use it wider and broader in different parts of America. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=212.12s)]
*  But there are also smaller issues, micro issues, that the judge here himself is supposed to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=215.44s)]
*  address without going to the Supreme Court, like the temporary restraining orders, like [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=221.54s)]
*  the issues to pause the actions that are happening here in the meantime before this gets to the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=226.28s)]
*  Supreme Court. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  That's what they're battling over right now, Liz. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Scott McFarland, Keebos Posted. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=234.76s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8KJOqw0oD8&t=236.0s)]
