# Expert breaks down the massive earthquake in Myanmar, Thailand
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI)
*  We want to bring in John Colin Mudder. He's a seismologist and professor of Earth and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=0.0s)]
*  Environmental Sciences at Columbia University. It's great to have you here at a moment like this [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=4.4s)]
*  to help us understand what just happened. I know there are two tectonic plates there along the fault [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=10.24s)]
*  line, but help us understand how that led to what is apparently quite a shallow quake, which made it [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=16.4s)]
*  even more dangerous. That's right. For a given magnitude, the shallower the earthquake, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=22.72s)]
*  the more shaking will happen, the more damage there'll be. This fault, it's called the Sagang [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=29.6s)]
*  fault, and it's very much like the San Andreas fault. The earthquake was very much like the [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=35.44s)]
*  1906 earthquake in San Francisco, about the same magnitude, same sort of depth. These are what we [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=43.52s)]
*  call strike-slip faults. The maximum magnitude they're likely to experience is about what you [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=50.88s)]
*  just got, somewhere up in the high sevens. What's remarkable about the building collapse [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=58.08s)]
*  that was caught on video is that some or many structures in Bangkok are built, I thought, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  to withstand some movement. Is that accurate? Are buildings in Myanmar, which I would imagine [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=73.12s)]
*  is not the case, anywhere near able to withstand that amount of movement? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=83.28s)]
*  No. The situation in Myanmar is that the building codes are very lax, or if they exist, they aren't [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  enforced well. They also don't have very good emergency services. They don't have anything [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  like FEMA. They don't have a USGS. They don't have anything like that. They'll have a lot of trouble [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=105.68s)]
*  coping with this, and that is, I understand why they've actually been willing to call on the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=112.64s)]
*  international community for help. What about in Bangkok? Bangkok, they have much better [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=118.56s)]
*  building codes, but no building code will allow you to survive any magnitude earthquake. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=128.64s)]
*  You'll always get damage from something as big as the one that happened in Myanmar. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=138.32s)]
*  One of the issues we heard out of these rescuers that we're watching in Bangkok is that the rubble [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  was too unstable for them to attempt to rescue the dozens of people believed to be stuck inside. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=151.44s)]
*  Would that still be the case? Would it be too dangerous right now for them to try and rescue [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  people? Well, I'm sure what they're worried about is that there are weakened structures and a lot [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=165.52s)]
*  of rubble like that. So an aftershock, even though they are always smaller than the main shock, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  an aftershock could cause even more damage in a structurally weakened building or something [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=180.8s)]
*  like what we're watching. Yeah. Our hearts go out to everyone there affected by this. John [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=187.28s)]
*  Colin Mudder, we appreciate you connecting with us and sharing your insight on this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=192.56s)]
*  Thanks for your time today. No, no, thank you. And we will continue to monitor developments in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=196.96s)]
*  Southeast Asia from this massive quake and its aftershocks. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aidQCM3AToI&t=204.16s)]
