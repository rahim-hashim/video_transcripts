# Trump moves to revoke collective bargaining rights for most federal workers
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0)
*  President Trump signed an executive order last night aimed at ending collective bargaining [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=0.0s)]
*  rights for many government workers. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=5.48s)]
*  The order applies to workers across many federal agencies, including the Departments of State, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=7.46s)]
*  Defense, Justice and Health and Human Services. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Earlier today, I spoke to the president of the United Automobile Workers, Sean Fain, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=14.4s)]
*  about President Trump's efforts. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=19.72s)]
*  Since you brought up this executive order, it regards an effort by the Trump administration [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  through the president to stop or certainly dramatically slow collective bargaining for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=28.86s)]
*  federal workers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=34.54s)]
*  Randy Irvin, who is currently the president of the National Federation of the Federal [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=36.46s)]
*  Employees calls it the biggest assault on collective bargaining he has ever seen. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=39.6s)]
*  Do you agree with those sentiments? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=45.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=47.82s)]
*  Spot on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=50.82s)]
*  Look, I remember when I was 12 years old when Reagan busted the Patco workers. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=51.82s)]
*  That was a massive issue back then. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=56.78s)]
*  We heard a lot of people talk about the labor. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=59.02s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=61.78s)]
*  And you know, that labor should have done more then. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=63.1s)]
*  Look, this is 100 times worse than Patco ever dreamed of being. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=65.9s)]
*  When you're talking 700,000 people, their contracts just being taken away. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=69.78s)]
*  And so, as I said, free speech is under attack. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=75.5s)]
*  Unions are under attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=80.86s)]
*  You look at the changes to the NLRB. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=82.26s)]
*  You look at the situation with the Department of Labor, Department of Education, Veterans [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=84.58s)]
*  Affairs. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=89.74s)]
*  I mean, why are all these things under attack? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=90.74s)]
*  Medicare, Social Security. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=92.3s)]
*  It's because, you know, billionaires want more tax cuts for themselves. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=94.34s)]
*  It's been proven time and again, that's not what works for America. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=97.46s)]
*  That's not good for the American people. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=100.56s)]
*  The working class people in America, they want their fair share. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=102.53999999999999s)]
*  They're not asking to be rich. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=105.42s)]
*  They just want a decent standard of living. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=106.98s)]
*  And again, that goes back to what we call our four core issues. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=108.62s)]
*  Making wages, adequate healthcare, retirement security, and having some quality of life [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=111.86s)]
*  other than just everything revolving around work. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=116.2s)]
*  You can see more of my conversation with UAW President Sean Fain this Sunday on Face the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=119.62s)]
*  Nation. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYqcIVLC3D0&t=124.14s)]
