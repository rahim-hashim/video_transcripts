# Trump says he considering cutting back on Canada tariffs as stock markets bounce
**CBS - Top News:** [March 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM)
*  We want to take you now to the White House where moments ago President Trump spoke about [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=0.0s)]
*  the economic uncertainty caused by a growing trade war with Canada. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=4.24s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=7.8s)]
*  Uncertainty about work ahead. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=9.6s)]
*  Well, I think they're going to do great. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=10.6s)]
*  I think our country had to do this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  We had to go and do this. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=15.8s)]
*  They've taken away other countries. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=17.12s)]
*  They've taken away our business. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=19.52s)]
*  They've taken away our jobs. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=20.88s)]
*  I did it initially very strongly against, as you know, China and some others in the first [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=23.12s)]
*  term, and it was a very successful term. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=29.08s)]
*  We had no inflation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=32.76s)]
*  And then we had COVID, which we had to straighten out. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=36.44s)]
*  So I didn't want to be doing anything with respect to other countries at that time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=38.94s)]
*  And we did a great job with it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=42.64s)]
*  We handed the stock market over. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=44.32s)]
*  It was higher than it ever was. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=45.68s)]
*  And think of that higher than it ever was to that point before. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=48.099999999999994s)]
*  And nobody thought that was even possible. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=52.04s)]
*  We did a great job. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=53.76s)]
*  But we had the greatest economy in history. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=55.36s)]
*  This economy, in my opinion, is going to blow it away. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=57.96s)]
*  But what I have to do is I have to get the workers back. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=61.0s)]
*  I have to get the factories open. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=63.64s)]
*  We have 90,000 factories and plants are closed from what you had just prior to NAFTA, which [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=65.32000000000001s)]
*  is not very long ago. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=72.22s)]
*  Ninety thousand. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=74.52s)]
*  Think of it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=75.6s)]
*  Ninety thousand factories and plants are closed from what it was. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=76.6s)]
*  And it's just not right. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=81.72s)]
*  So and we gave it away. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=83.66s)]
*  Before me gave it away and I could name every one of them. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  But they gave it away and we're taking it back. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=89.96s)]
*  We're taking our jobs back. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=91.92s)]
*  And one of the things I'll say, by the way, speaking of Tesla, he manufactures more cars. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=93.88s)]
*  I mean, he opened this incredible plant, one of the largest plants in the world in Texas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=98.84s)]
*  Could you talk about that? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=103.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's worth noting that the Tesla cars have the most US content of any cars on the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=104.92s)]
*  market. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=110.88s)]
*  So that the most American made. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=111.88s)]
*  We have the biggest factory. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=113.4s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Olivia Rinaldi is with us from our Washington bureau. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  Olivia, there's been a lot of back and forth today. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=122.0s)]
*  Prior to today regarding tariffs in the US, particularly US and Canada. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=125.12s)]
*  Catch us up to speed. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=130.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to be with you again. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=131.08s)]
*  We just heard from the president there where he said he's considering cutting back on the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=134.04000000000002s)]
*  50 percent tariffs. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=137.64000000000001s)]
*  He announced earlier today that would be on Canadian exports as far as electricity. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=139.08s)]
*  So let's back up a little bit here and just walk you through all of this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  We heard from Ontario's premier, which is essentially their governor, Ford. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  He had said that there's going to be a 25 percent tariff on electricity going to three [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=154.44s)]
*  US states. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=159.16000000000003s)]
*  That would be New York, Michigan and Minnesota. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  As a result, Trump then said starting tomorrow, March 12, there would be an increase in tariffs [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=163.24s)]
*  from 25 percent to 50 percent on Canadian steel and aluminum that come into the US. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=168.74s)]
*  It's important to note Canada is a huge supplier of steel in the US. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=176.66s)]
*  So this would certainly ratchet up this trade war a little bit. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=182.1s)]
*  Trump was asked about this a short while ago and he said he's considering cutting back [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=186.66s)]
*  on that 50 percent tariff that he actually announced. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=189.54s)]
*  He said he's looking at it and he can make a different decision. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=191.92s)]
*  Also notable, we had heard from Premier Ford and Secretary Lutnick about an hour ago where [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=194.9s)]
*  they said, announcing this deal essentially between the two leaders regarding tariffs, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=201.3s)]
*  that because there would be a meeting in D.C. between Ford and Lutnick, that Ford said Ontario [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=208.98s)]
*  would not put this 25 percent tariff on electricity. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=215.54s)]
*  Trump said, Ford rather, he called him a strong man in Canada. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=220.08s)]
*  He called Trump and said he's not going to do that regarding the electricity. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  And Trump said he respects that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=229.72s)]
*  So clearly some conversation between the two leaders today, specifically on this issue [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=232.0s)]
*  of tariffs and the tit for tat we've heard there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=236.36s)]
*  But ultimately Trump says in the latest decision on this back and forth and tit for tat that [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=240.52s)]
*  there will not be, or he's reconsidering rather, this tariff he planned to put on tomorrow [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=245.72s)]
*  on steel and aluminum imports. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=251.16s)]
*  So obviously the president watches the market. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=254.4s)]
*  We've been watching the markets. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=256.8s)]
*  Things did not close well yesterday. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=258.64s)]
*  All three markets down slightly today, so there was a bit of a rebound. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=260.52s)]
*  But what is the administration saying about the markets and the economy, really as a result [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=263.44s)]
*  of investor reaction to these policies? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=268.28s)]
*  Yeah, the White House is saying there's a divergence between essentially what they're seeing on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=270.52s)]
*  the short term with these animal spirit markets is what they're calling them, the bear and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=275.0s)]
*  bull market related to market rallies, market sell-offs. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=279.97999999999996s)]
*  They said there's a divergence between that and what they actually hear from business [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=283.47999999999996s)]
*  leaders. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=287.62s)]
*  And they say business leaders tell them they're excited to be investing in America, investing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=288.62s)]
*  back in the U.S. because of Trump's pro-business policies, his impending tax cuts that they're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=292.76s)]
*  will agree to and enact when they eventually take up that bill, perhaps later in the spring, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=300.52s)]
*  early summer. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=305.96s)]
*  And because of that, the White House is predicting that even though Q1, we're going to see some [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=306.96s)]
*  economic blips, some data related to inflation and high prices that are certainly going to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=311.88s)]
*  make consumers feel wary. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=317.52s)]
*  Come quarter two, they're hoping there will be an economic boom based off of Trump's [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=319.84s)]
*  tax cuts and pro-business policy. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=324.2s)]
*  It's important to note, though, this isn't the last time we're going to hear from Trump [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=325.84s)]
*  today. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=329.48s)]
*  He's going to head over to a business roundtable with the business leaders, top 100 business [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=330.48s)]
*  leaders in the country, and talk to them about his economic plans and tariffs and the ongoing [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=334.52s)]
*  economic stress that we've been seeing across the country. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=340.72s)]
*  These are people, though, who lost a ton of money yesterday, a little bit today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=344.98s)]
*  It seems like all the markets closed down, even though they just closed. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=350.08s)]
*  And so this is going to be an interesting conversation that he's going to have, where [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=354.18s)]
*  he's going to have to kind of walk this fine line with the business roundtable and [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=357.24s)]
*  these leaders who are against this tariff plan and but are pro his tax cuts and pro [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=360.6s)]
*  business. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=368.04s)]
*  We know a lot of these leaders supported him during the reelection campaign of 2024. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=369.04s)]
*  So this will be a very interesting conversation he's going to have in a short little bit. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=374.8s)]
*  Obviously, with the markets hanging over, it does make his tariff plan a little bit [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=379.68s)]
*  more difficult, and people are a little bit more wary of it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=383.88s)]
*  So we'll be interested to see what he says. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=386.12s)]
*  Olivia, we're not. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=389.64s)]
*  CBS News Money Watch correspondent Kelly O'Grady joins me now in Studio 57. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=390.64s)]
*  So I want to pick up on what Olivia was talking about. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=394.2s)]
*  But in a second, because we obviously were talking 24 hours ago about the swings that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=396.24s)]
*  the market was undergoing. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=401.2s)]
*  What position are we in today? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  It closed as opposed to yesterday. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=404.28s)]
*  So we are in a worse position than yesterday, but not that much worse. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=406.56s)]
*  OK, so the down closed down over a percent. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=412.32s)]
*  Right. We were down 478 and actually love that the control team put up this chart because [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=415.72s)]
*  I want you to see how much it fluctuated during the day. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=420.8s)]
*  At one point, we were down over 700. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=425.32000000000005s)]
*  At one point, it looked like, well, maybe we might actually go positive. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=428.48s)]
*  And the Nasdaq and the S&P both were down slightly. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  The Nasdaq was actually positive at one point. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=436.04s)]
*  And so from a numbers perspective, when you look at the markets, we are worse than we [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=438.20000000000005s)]
*  were yesterday. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=443.24s)]
*  From a tariff perspective, we are kind of in the same spot. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=444.68s)]
*  We still expect tariffs to the tune of 25 percent on aluminum and steel across the board. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=450.08s)]
*  Doesn't matter where they're from to go into effect tomorrow. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=456.0s)]
*  We might see a 50 percent tariff on aluminum and steel from Canada. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=459.47999999999996s)]
*  Does look like maybe the president is considering not that to that extent. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=464.12s)]
*  But I think overall, investors, I mean, you saw just how much things fluctuated today. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=469.84000000000003s)]
*  It is whiplash. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=475.72s)]
*  We could have had five different conversations about where the market was, depending on where [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  we would have spoken today. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=482.2s)]
*  And so I think investors are looking at the situation going into tomorrow, an inflation [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=483.8s)]
*  read. And that's why you saw that pullback right at the end of the day, because it kind [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=489.16s)]
*  of felt like we got a little bit of a reprieve with the energy export tax being lifted or [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=493.04s)]
*  paused, at least for the moment. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=498.44s)]
*  Maybe those 50 percent tariffs not going into place. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=499.96s)]
*  You would have expected to see the Dow rebound very, very sharply. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=502.48s)]
*  Huh. I think the fact that we saw the pullback as investors really, you know what, we got [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=506.24s)]
*  an inflation read coming out tomorrow. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=509.52s)]
*  I'm going to sell and then we'll wait. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=510.92s)]
*  So, Olivia, I was talking about the business roundtable, a lot of interesting conversations [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=513.4s)]
*  happening at that table with people losing a lot of money. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=516.4s)]
*  I mean, everyday people also are losing money. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=519.6s)]
*  It's not just business people. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=522.8s)]
*  People might be checking their 401Ks, their IRAs and thinking, man, I'm thousands of [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=524.2s)]
*  dollars less. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=528.0s)]
*  I have thousands of dollars less than I did before. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=530.28s)]
*  I mean, what are, you know, the president says short term loss, long term gain. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=532.92s)]
*  I mean, how how are Wall Street and Main Street taking those messages? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=538.48s)]
*  So when he says short term loss, long term gain, look, he is not wrong. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=542.64s)]
*  If we were able to bring lots of manufacturing here, have a supply chain that is [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=547.72s)]
*  much more centered in the United States. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=553.84s)]
*  You saw how we struggled with COVID being so reliant on China. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  Those are good things. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=559.76s)]
*  More American jobs are good things, but that takes so much time. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=561.3199999999999s)]
*  And in the meantime, as you said, you have people looking at their 401Ks. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=565.1999999999999s)]
*  How I would put this into perspective is unless you're looking to retire tomorrow, you sort [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=569.28s)]
*  of wait and you see because we know markets will fluctuate. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=573.88s)]
*  And I do want to put this into context. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=577.16s)]
*  You go back to 2008, OK, pull up the chart of the Dow then. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=579.24s)]
*  It was so much more of a sell off. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=583.72s)]
*  We are certainly not in that place right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  The data says that we are not going into a recession yet. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=588.64s)]
*  So I think just take a breath. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=591.88s)]
*  And I think more for businesses, though, they have to make immediate decisions right now. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=594.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, do you invest? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=598.96s)]
*  Do you not invest? Do you hire more people? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=600.0s)]
*  Do you lay off people? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=601.8000000000001s)]
*  How much money do you buy for the next six months? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=602.84s)]
*  Exactly. That's what's really, really debilitating. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=603.32s)]
*  And I hate to use this term, but you kind of get into this paralysis. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=606.52s)]
*  How do you move when things are changing by the hour? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=610.24s)]
*  What is the Fed doing with all this information? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=613.12s)]
*  I can't wait to hear Chair Jerome Powell speak next week. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=615.36s)]
*  So we are getting an interest rate decision next Wednesday. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=618.6s)]
*  We are expecting them to hold interest rate study. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=622.28s)]
*  We're actually expecting them to hold interest rate study until roughly the summer, maybe more. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=625.16s)]
*  The Fed is faced with two very big issues. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=630.32s)]
*  You have inflation, which has been getting further and further away from two percent. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=634.0s)]
*  And if we have tariffs that go into place and increase the prices of things, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=638.3199999999999s)]
*  that is going to make inflation worse likely. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  But what they are also looking at is a pullback in consumer spending, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=646.52s)]
*  a labor market, which has been slowing but not going off a cliff. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=650.8399999999999s)]
*  And so you have them sort of balancing these two different pieces. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=655.4s)]
*  I'm very interested to hear him say, I mean, are they in a wait and see mode? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  Because they're sort of you could have spending pullback so much that they need to think about restarting growth in this country, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=664.68s)]
*  sort of a couple of months down the line, but you could also have inflation increase. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=671.84s)]
*  And that is a term that we will likely hear over the next few weeks called stagflation. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=675.72s)]
*  I think that's what they're they're looking for. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=680.04s)]
*  So obviously, the the tariff news is not over. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=682.92s)]
*  You had mentioned something that we're waiting for tomorrow. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=686.28s)]
*  Do you think that the markets are going to react accordingly as well? [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=688.4s)]
*  I mean, are you sort of buckling in for sort of a turbulent week? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=691.6s)]
*  I am buckling in for a turbulent week. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=695.24s)]
*  I'm buckling in for a turbulent month because remember, we also have April 2nd coming, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=697.76s)]
*  which is another round of reciprocal tariffs. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=702.36s)]
*  And the president has really teed that up as the big tariff plan. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=705.08s)]
*  And so you could see a lot more pain then. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=708.84s)]
*  I also look at what we like to call the fear index. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=711.44s)]
*  Not an amazing name. It's called the VIX. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=714.84s)]
*  And it's basically measures and predicts how much market turbulence you're going to have over the next month. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=717.04s)]
*  It's pretty high. So that could mean swings positively. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=723.28s)]
*  But, yeah, I think we're in for a bumpy road right now. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=726.48s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady, thank you. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJFAlnzdELM&t=728.76s)]
