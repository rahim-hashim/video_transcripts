# Stefanik nomination withdrawal catches some GOP lawmakers by surprise
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg)
*  Nomination pulled. The White House withdraws New York Congresswoman Elise [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=0.0s)]
*  Stefanik's nomination to be the next ambassador to the United Nations. Why the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=5.04s)]
*  Republicans' tight majority in the House of Representatives is quite likely to [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=9.52s)]
*  blame. Group chat in court, not those who were on the chat but the whole issue. A [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=13.68s)]
*  federal judge held a hearing about the war plans that were accidentally shared [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=18.04s)]
*  with a journalist and that judge is ordering officials to preserve all the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=22.32s)]
*  signal messages in question for review. This is the same judge incidentally that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=26.64s)]
*  President Trump has said should be impeached for the way he is overseeing a [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=33.2s)]
*  controversial deportation flights case. Also, tariff turmoil. The Dow drops one [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=37.2s)]
*  day after the president announces a 25% levy on cars not made in the US and some [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=43.32s)]
*  auto stocks today took a dive. What all this could mean politically and for your [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=49.64s)]
*  wallet. Later this hour more job cuts. The Trump administration is shrinking [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=54.76s)]
*  quite noticeably the size of the Department of Health and Human Services [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  by how much? Nearly a quarter of its current employees. The impact this could [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  have on the nation's ability to fight diseases. All that tonight but we're [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=68.16s)]
*  going to start with Ed O'Keefe and Nicole Killian. Ed is at the White House, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=72.28s)]
*  Nicole of course on Capitol Hill. Ed tell us more about pulling the nomination [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  of Elise Stefanik. Well Major, go Yankees. It turns out that the White House [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=81.04s)]
*  realized yet again that the margins are just too narrow in the Republican [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=86.72s)]
*  controlled House of Representatives that they can't afford to lose that key vote [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=91.64s)]
*  from the Adirondacks that Elise Stefanik provides. She was set to be nominated and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=95.2s)]
*  probably easily confirmed potentially even with bipartisan support to lead the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=100.72s)]
*  or to serve as ambassador to the United Nations but given the margins right now [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=104.92s)]
*  it's sitting about what is it 218 to 213 by next Tuesday if Republicans win the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=109.24s)]
*  two special elections in Florida it'll go up to 220 to 213 but then there's two [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=115.08s)]
*  open Democratic seats so you have a margin eventually later this year of 220 [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=119.64s)]
*  to 215 with a lot of big votes to come and a handful of Republicans who are [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  likely to vote no the speaker the White House realizing we can't afford to let [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  it go. Was there some reluctance on her part? Perhaps. Was there also potentially [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=133.0s)]
*  some difference of opinion or personality between her and those that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=137.56s)]
*  now control the State Department given that she was nominated and came up as [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=141.84s)]
*  the ambassador pick before Secretary of State Rubio was in place? Yes I'm told [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=146.16s)]
*  that's also potentially part of it but the big reason and the one everyone [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=150.0s)]
*  will focus on publicly is that margin in the house and how razor-thin it [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=153.52s)]
*  remains. And Nicole this is right in your lane on Capitol Hill. Pick up on what Ed [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=158.0s)]
*  said not only about the closeness of the margin the necessity Republicans now [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=163.44s)]
*  see in the leadership ranks on the House side to maintain every viable Republican [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=167.64s)]
*  vote possible and what this might mean for what's going on behind the scenes in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=172.28s)]
*  somewhat difficult negotiations between House Republicans and Senate Republicans [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=176.76s)]
*  on how to proceed on a budget and tax bill. Well I would first say go Dodgers [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=181.04s)]
*  but that aside. I think what's interesting is that for all the talk about how narrow the margins are [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=185.84s)]
*  I mean we're in the business of journalism this isn't breaking news here [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=196.16s)]
*  in the Congress so this did catch some lawmakers by surprise even within [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=199.2s)]
*  leadership for instance we were told Senate Majority Leader John Thune said [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=206.44s)]
*  that he was not given a heads up about the withdrawal of this nomination you [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=212.44s)]
*  know we caught up with Majority Leader Steve Scalise soon after the news broke [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=217.32s)]
*  he didn't seem to be aware at the time before this was all confirmed that her [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=221.72s)]
*  nomination would be pulled he still was backing her as a solid candidate for the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=227.6s)]
*  UN ambassadorship so from that standpoint you know many lawmakers were [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=233.36s)]
*  a bit surprised by this we did hear from Senate Foreign Relations Chair Jim [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=239.04s)]
*  Risch who said that he did have a conversation with the White House which [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=244.44s)]
*  informed him that Stefanik's nomination had been pulled however he did not say [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=248.16s)]
*  whether or not he believed that that was the right decision obviously Stefanik's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=254.16s)]
*  nomination went through his committee she got out of that committee with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=259.56s)]
*  bipartisan support he told me that was a decision obviously that was ultimately [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=263.32s)]
*  up to the president I also talked to a member of the Foreign Relations Committee [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=267.52s)]
*  Congressman Brian Schatz a Democrat he too said Democrats on the panel did not [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=271.44s)]
*  get any heads up about this and he as many lawmakers have indicated believe [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=276.88s)]
*  this is because again of these margins in the House that House Republicans [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=282.88s)]
*  there's a little trepidation and uncertainty about having the votes in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  place particularly when it comes to advancing the president's agenda so he [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=292.64s)]
*  echoed what we are hearing from some congressional Republicans that that may [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=297.16s)]
*  be a play as well I also asked him who he would like to see in the role and he [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=300.36s)]
*  said Mitt Romney which would be an interesting choice if it were to come to pass but you [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=304.48s)]
*  know that being said that being said you know many lawmakers on both sides of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  the aisle really felt that Stefanik was solid was sharp you know would likely [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=315.68s)]
*  advance so it did take many of them are back to hear this news today [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=321.04s)]
*  Oh Ed O'Keefe let's just put a pin in that the probability of Mitt Romney getting that nomination near zero [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=325.92s)]
*  just about as good as the Red Sox winning the World Series [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=331.44s)]
*  we're gonna we're gonna keep the baseball theme which I got rolling rolling right along [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  Nicole I want to ask you this because the president said on social media at least [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  Stefanik will go back to her position in the House Republican leadership is there a vacancy? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=344.72s)]
*  Well not really because now that vacancy is filled by Lisa McLean who is the GOP [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  conference chair and it's unlikely that she would step down from that post so [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=355.32s)]
*  whether or not some new leadership position is created remains to be seen [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  that is something that speaker Mike Johnson indicated in a post on X [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=365.0s)]
*  saying that you know Elise Stefanik is a great leader and they will welcome her [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=369.76s)]
*  back to the leadership table but he didn't define what position that might be so again there's still [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=376.59999999999997s)]
*  a lot to work out here in the house but again one thing we know is that obviously having those [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=383.08s)]
*  votes in place was important not only to the president but to the speaker as well [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=389.88s)]
*  Ed quickly the signal Yemen attack plan story day four mistake is the word that Republicans most frequently use [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=394.12s)]
*  is it going to be a damaging one for anyone that you can tell involved? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=404.44s)]
*  The president is closely monitoring to see what the ongoing media and political fallout from it [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=410.36s)]
*  will be we can report at this hour that he is standing by his national security advisor and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=415.88s)]
*  the defense secretary there was a long meeting in the Oval Office yesterday about all this where [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=421.64s)]
*  they discussed the possibility of Mike Waltz resigning Waltz did not offer it the president [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=425.56s)]
*  didn't ask for it and he is standing by them we should also point out that a federal judge this [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=430.84s)]
*  afternoon ordered most of those on this text chain to preserve the texts to keep them so that they [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  can be added to the official presidential records a non-partisan watchdog group here in Washington [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=442.28s)]
*  had sued to ensure that they eventually do end up in the records as a formality in essence because [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=447.08s)]
*  they believe that this is classified and it should be part of it the judge the same one by the way [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=452.44s)]
*  ruling in the alien enemies act case just randomly selected by the district court here in [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=457.4s)]
*  Washington to see it's a get you've got till Monday to do this we probably can avoid a court case [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  let's agree to get them preserved and move on we'll see if that happens also worth pointing out [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=466.52s)]
*  the top Republican top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee today sent a letter asking [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=471.15999999999997s)]
*  for an inspector general Pentagon inspector general investigation at all that which is a [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=475.96s)]
*  bipartisan move that the White House cannot ignore Ed O'Keefe and Nicole Killian thank you so much [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=480.84s)]
*  Kelly O'Grady joins me now so Kelly tariffs autos market reaction sum it up for us if you can [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=486.6s)]
*  so look uh investors didn't love it you saw all the three major indexes close down you know but [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=494.28000000000003s)]
*  not not the crazy thing that we've seen in the past couple of weeks where we really saw how [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=500.36s)]
*  investors felt were in the major three auto stocks so I'll just kind of run you through GM closed [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=505.56s)]
*  down over seven percent Ford down four percent Stellantis down 1.3 percent and really I'll zero [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=510.36s)]
*  in on GM because that is all about the fact that they have more exposure with where their cars are [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=517.48s)]
*  made than the other big two they rely on Mexico and Canada far more than Ford and Stellantis so [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=523.64s)]
*  when you're thinking about a tariff being slapped on any foreign cars coming into the U.S. they are [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=530.12s)]
*  going to feel it most you contrast that with what happened in the markets with Tesla and Rivian [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=535.88s)]
*  100 percent of their cars are made in the U.S. investors loved that because the stock was up [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=540.76s)]
*  today Kelly I want to play for you something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=545.16s)]
*  because you mentioned Canada and the implications for the auto industry here and there let's listen [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=549.9599999999999s)]
*  the old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=556.28s)]
*  economies and tight security and military cooperation is over. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=560.84s)]
*  Mark Carney also said that until President Trump up front respects Canadian sovereignty this [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=568.2s)]
*  relationship will remain on the rocks. Well I mean that we have heard some some bark and bite [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=574.76s)]
*  throughout this entire thing we have seen the Ontario PM come to the table and talk with I [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=582.2s)]
*  believe it was Commerce Secretary Lutnick about different things but I think what is really [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=589.24s)]
*  interesting here is so much of the supply chains are intertwined Canada Mexico the U.S. and these [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=593.64s)]
*  auto manufacturers invested in that because of that important trade deal USMCA and now they're [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  sort of looking at things going oh my gosh I have to now bring my plants to the U.S. and that's [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=606.84s)]
*  going to cost time billions of dollars and then let's look ahead major to 2026 when the USMCA is [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=611.24s)]
*  up for review and maybe all of this concern goes away maybe this is an entire negotiation [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=618.6s)]
*  but certainly strong words from the Canadian PM we'll see if that bark turns into bite. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  USMCA negotiated during Trump 1.0. Kelly O'Grady thank you very very much. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6INwloSpGg&t=628.44s)]
