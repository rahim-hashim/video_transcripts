# Trump officials include Atlantic editor in group chat about Yemen bombing plans
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M)
*  And the NSC, Willie, says a story that was published in The Atlantic claiming its editor-in-chief [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=0.0s)]
*  was included on a text chain with cabinet members and high-level officials about military [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=5.16s)]
*  action in Yemen appears to be authentic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=10.3s)]
*  What more are we learning? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=12.68s)]
*  Yeah, this is a wild story coming from The Atlantic. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=13.68s)]
*  As you mentioned, the editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was included on this signal chain, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=17.56s)]
*  the signal text chain. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=22.44s)]
*  And I want to give, put out part of the statement that the NSC spokesperson, Brian Hughes, sent. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=23.44s)]
*  He said, at this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  And we are reviewing how an inadvertent member was added to the chain. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=33.44s)]
*  He then goes on to say this thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=37.8s)]
*  between senior officials. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=43.96s)]
*  Now, included on this text chain were reportedly Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, Mike [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Walz, who initiated the change, the chain, according to this report in The Atlantic. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=52.4s)]
*  That included that reporter on there as well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=57.96s)]
*  And now, the reason why this is a really interesting story is because the information that was [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  shared on that chain, sensitive information, operational information about the Houthi, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=67.28s)]
*  the attack on the Houthis in Yemen before it happened, this reporter found out before [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=73.56s)]
*  it happened. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=78.16s)]
*  He initially didn't believe that this was the case, that these government officials [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=79.16s)]
*  could potentially be sharing this information on a publicly available commercial app, not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=81.84s)]
*  a government communication system, which is typically the case. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=88.44s)]
*  But nonetheless, this really opens the question as to whether or not it was legal to do so, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=93.12s)]
*  because there are questions about the federal laws that prohibit the sharing of information [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=98.28s)]
*  in this type of manner, everything from the Espionage Act into destruction of records, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=104.12s)]
*  because the message, some of the messages on here were set to disappear. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=109.6s)]
*  And when you're sending messages that has to do with government officials, government [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=114.19999999999999s)]
*  types of things like this, they have to be stored for future generations to potentially [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=118.16s)]
*  see even if they're sensitive, classified information, Lindsay. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  OK, Willie James Inman, thank you. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hl8LIYU_-M&t=126.39999999999999s)]
