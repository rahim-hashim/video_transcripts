# Inside the list of people deported to El Salvador last weekend
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY)
*  And breaking this morning, CBS News has obtained an internal government list of those Venezuelan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=0.0s)]
*  men who were deported to El Salvador over the weekend. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=4.84s)]
*  The White House claims they are all violent gang members. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=7.26s)]
*  That's what they claim. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=10.48s)]
*  But the record suggests that that may not be true. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=11.48s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez, who [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=13.96s)]
*  broke that story for us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=18.0s)]
*  So first of all, what did the record show? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=19.64s)]
*  Well, the records contains the name of 238 Venezuelan nationals deported to El Salvador [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=22.8s)]
*  last weekend and imprisoned there in that country as part of this mass deportation operation [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=31.08s)]
*  that the chamber administration has been orchestrating. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=36.08s)]
*  The records themselves do not show whether or not they have criminal histories in the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=39.04s)]
*  U.S., but we do know from a sworn declaration by an ICE official in federal court that many [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  of the people sent to El Salvador do not have criminal histories in the U.S. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=49.24s)]
*  Some do, but many do not, according to this ICE official. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=53.96s)]
*  But they're all being accused, Vlad, of being part of this notorious transnational gang [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Tren De Agua that originated in Venezuela's prisons. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  However, lawyers and relatives of the deportees are contesting those allegations and are saying [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=64.68s)]
*  that their family members are non-criminals and that they are not gang members. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=71.2s)]
*  And that is really at the center of this story. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=75.84s)]
*  The question of due process, because people are saying that even if these people are alleged [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=78.48s)]
*  gang members, they should have had a day in court in the U.S. to contest those charges [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=83.28s)]
*  and to be able to fight those accusations from the government. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=88.08s)]
*  They did not get that opportunity. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=91.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad you honed in on that point, Camilo, because on one hand, you've got the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  government claiming one thing, that these members are members of a violent gang. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  In particular, family members say they are not. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  So we have due process in this country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=106.44000000000001s)]
*  And again, people need to understand that due process applies to everyone, not just [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  American citizens, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=114.08000000000001s)]
*  So including people who are here illegally. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  Including people who are here illegally. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=117.72s)]
*  And so the fact that this gentleman, the one that you focused on in particular, was not [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=119.12s)]
*  able to get his day in court, this is unprecedented. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=123.88000000000001s)]
*  And the law that the administration is citing to carry out these deportations dates back [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  to 1798, the Alien Enemies Act, and it allows the government to do just that, to summarily [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=132.94s)]
*  arrest, detain and deport individuals from nations that are orchestrating an invasion [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=138.82s)]
*  or an incursion into the U.S. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=144.06s)]
*  The administration is arguing that Tren de Agua is orchestrating that so-called invasion [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=146.06s)]
*  or incursion of the U.S. and that any suspected gang member from Venezuela can be summarily [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=149.98s)]
*  arrested and deported without any of the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=155.57999999999998s)]
*  law. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=160.54s)]
*  So the only criteria that the government has to satisfy to now deport people under this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=161.54s)]
*  proclamation is that they have to find that the men are 14 or older, that they're Venezuelan, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=165.42s)]
*  that they lack U.S. citizenship or permanent residency, and that they are allegedly part [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=171.18s)]
*  of this gang and allegedly is the key word here. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=175.98s)]
*  Vlad. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  You've got some new reporting as well about migrant detainee flights to Guantanamo. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=183.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=184.7s)]
*  So last week, the migrant holding facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba were emptied out by [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=185.7s)]
*  the Trump administration and the detainees being held there were sent to a staging area [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=190.89999999999998s)]
*  in Louisiana to be deported from there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=195.54s)]
*  But now we have learned that flights of migrant detainees to Guantanamo Bay have resumed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=198.14s)]
*  Indeed, yesterday we are told by U.S. officials one military aircraft transported about 21 [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=202.94s)]
*  migrant detainees to Cuba, to the naval base there, and we are told that more flights are [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=210.1s)]
*  on the way this week as well. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=215.17999999999998s)]
*  So this operation, of course, is fulfilling that promise made by President Trump to convert [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=216.78s)]
*  the naval base there into a massive detention center to hold as many as 30,000 people, even [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=221.98s)]
*  though the number of detainees has not reached that point at all. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=226.82s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=230.62s)]
*  Camila Montoya-Galváez, thank you very much for coming by. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=231.62s)]
*  Thanks, Vlad. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=233.62s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGq5OIyM_UY&t=234.62s)]
