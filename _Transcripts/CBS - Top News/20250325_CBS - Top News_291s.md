# Trump administration invokes state secrets privilege in El Salvador deportations case
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU)
*  Moving on to a different story here, the legal fight over the Trump administration's deportation [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=0.0s)]
*  of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador continues to play out in a D.C. appeals court. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=5.08s)]
*  Today is the deadline for the Justice Department to explain to Judge James Boasberg why and [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=10.28s)]
*  how they failed to follow his orders that temporarily blocked such deportations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  Trump officials argue that their use of the Alien Enemies Act targets gang members, and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=21.04s)]
*  that is why the Justice Department is trying to get Boasberg's decision overturned. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen, who has been following [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=30.88s)]
*  the story for us. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=35.04s)]
*  Jake, good to see you today. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=36.2s)]
*  What are the chances that Judge Boasberg will get all of his questions answered? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=37.68s)]
*  Almost zero, and that's because last night the Department of Justice and the Executive [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=44.04s)]
*  Branch decided to invoke the state secret privilege, which means that they're invoking [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  national security reasons and national security secrets for why they will not disclose any [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=51.28s)]
*  answers to Judge Boasberg's questions. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=56.64s)]
*  The only thing that the government has put so far in the record of this court case is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=59.02s)]
*  what time these two planes left U.S. airspace and went over international waters and airspace [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=62.04s)]
*  on their way to El Salvador. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=67.08s)]
*  They have not answered what time these alleged gang members were brought from wherever they [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=69.22s)]
*  were stationed and put on planes, whether any notice was given to these people of where [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=73.08s)]
*  thus potentially giving them room if they could make a phone call or call an attorney [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=78.66s)]
*  to file a legal challenge to block their deportation, and what time the government was made aware [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=83.66s)]
*  at the White House, what time Judge Boasberg's order was called from a Department of Justice [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  attorney to the White House, and then after that, as we know, the ultimate decision to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=93.46s)]
*  not turn those planes around. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=98.34s)]
*  A lot of unanswered questions. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=100.14s)]
*  Judge Boasberg has ordered that by today the Department of Justice is due to explain why [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=102.34s)]
*  it did not turn those planes around. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=107.28s)]
*  The plaintiffs, including the ACLU and its attorneys, will have an opportunity to respond [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=109.08s)]
*  to that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=113.2s)]
*  In addition to that, plaintiffs will also have an opportunity to respond to why they [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=114.2s)]
*  feel it's inappropriate for the government to potentially invoke the state secret privilege. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=117.92s)]
*  So a lot more to come on this, and this all comes on the heels of yesterday's argument [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=122.0s)]
*  in front of a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals as to whether Judge Boasberg even had the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=125.56s)]
*  authority in the first place to put this block on these deportations. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=129.68s)]
*  We know judges who have blocked President Trump's agenda could be in the hot seat next [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=133.76000000000002s)]
*  week. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=138.88s)]
*  What can you tell us about that? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=139.88s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=140.88s)]
*  There's news reports that Jim Jordan, who leads the House Judiciary Committee and has [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=142.88s)]
*  long been a critic of judges, what he calls activist judges, in the judicial system who [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=147.6s)]
*  have blocked these Trump executive orders or executive actions, there's over 160 lawsuits [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=155.56s)]
*  that we're tracking right now. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=161.0s)]
*  There are about a dozen, two dozen instances of these judges blocking these nation- with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=162.48s)]
*  either nationwide injunctions, meaning that in one court case a judge blocks the nationwide [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=166.44s)]
*  implementation of something, which in this case would be the Trump administration's, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=170.92s)]
*  you know, mass deportations or the military ban of transgender service members, things [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=175.52s)]
*  along those lines. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=180.6s)]
*  He's hoping to call a hearing specifically related to Judge Boasberg behavior, although [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=181.96s)]
*  it's unclear and very unlikely that they would be able to get Judge Boasberg in front of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=185.52s)]
*  them for any kind of testimony, although that would not rule out bringing in outside groups [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  who are critical of these kinds of judges and judges' decisions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  Jim Jordan also said that he intends on potentially moving forward and at least looking into a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  bill in Congress that would look to block these kinds of wide-ranging judicial decisions [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  from district court judges. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Again, that would likely be unconstitutional, but that does not mean the House could hold [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  hearings on it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=212.76s)]
*  I was literally going to ask you if that was even constitutional in the first place. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=213.76s)]
*  Thanks for answering that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=217.2s)]
*  Now we have you here, Jake. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  I also want to ask you about another case that's playing out in court today, and that [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  is the American Civil Liberties Union's lawsuit against Trump's executive order, which bars [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=223.32s)]
*  transgender people from updating their sex on their passports. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=229.28s)]
*  What exactly is at stake here? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, it really relates again back to another Trump executive order in which on Inauguration [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=235.48s)]
*  Day, Donald Trump said out loud from the Capitol Hill stage where he was speaking that there [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  are only two genders in America, male or female. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=246.0s)]
*  There is no room for anyone who identifies outside of that as either an ex on a passport, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=248.84s)]
*  which typically identifies someone who is transitioning or someone who just believes [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=253.52s)]
*  that they do not subscribe to either of those genders. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=256.88s)]
*  There are about a dozen legal cases so far involving either LGBTQ issues or the trans [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=260.2s)]
*  military service ban, things along those lines. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=266.88s)]
*  This is one instance of that where people who have transitioned do not identify as male [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=268.9s)]
*  or female are assuming to block this implementation of this executive order, which again, on a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=273.58s)]
*  formal government document, not at the state level of a driver's license, you would be [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=278.18s)]
*  forced to put yourself in one bucket or another. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=282.14s)]
*  Okay, CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen, thank you so much for joining [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=284.7s)]
*  us today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTFa_wr_RyU&t=290.53999999999996s)]
