# U.S.-Ukraine joint statement on Black Sea navigation
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc)
*  CBS News White House reporter Willie James-Enman joins us as well. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Before we start, we have some breaking news on a joint statement from the U.S. and Russia. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=4.16s)]
*  Willie, what more can you tell us about that? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Hey there, Mugo. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=11.88s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=13.84s)]
*  Well, this statement comes after negotiators, those technical negotiators, have been working [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=14.84s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia hour by hour to come to some type of consensus when it comes to the Black [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=19.52s)]
*  Sea to essentially stop the conflict there. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=26.12s)]
*  Now, we do have a statement that comes from the U.S. and Russia and also the U.S. and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine talking about both negotiations and separate statements. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=35.16s)]
*  And the main part of it has to do with the Black Sea. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=39.04s)]
*  And I want to read part of it here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=42.4s)]
*  It says, the United States and Ukraine have agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=43.4s)]
*  the use of force and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=47.56s)]
*  Sea. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=53.04s)]
*  There's also a statement from the U.S. describing the U.S. and Russia negotiations as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=54.04s)]
*  And it says basically the same thing, to eliminate the use of force and prevent the use of commercial [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=59.72s)]
*  vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=64.08s)]
*  That was the major sticking point here, was to stop those military incursions, to stop [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=66.72s)]
*  those attacks essentially in the naval, in the area, I should say, of the Black Sea. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=72.4s)]
*  Part of this would, of course, include further moving towards a more lasting peace. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=78.88s)]
*  That's what both statements lay out here. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=84.12s)]
*  This is, of course, a significant development following those negotiations. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=86.78s)]
*  I'll note that we were supposed to get a statement earlier today at 4 a.m. from the U.S. and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=90.98s)]
*  the Russians. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=95.86s)]
*  And that didn't happen in large part because the Russians wanted to see about how this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=96.86s)]
*  meeting played out in Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=103.62s)]
*  But this outline here on the outcomes of the U.S. talks with both Russia and Ukraine is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=105.78s)]
*  a significant step in moving towards peace between those two nations, MUGO. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=113.54s)]
*  Yeah, well, it definitely sounds like it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=119.26s)]
*  I also want to pivot now and ask you about that article from The Atlantic. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=121.14s)]
*  Do we have any idea how the Trump administration plans to handle this? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=125.86000000000001s)]
*  I know earlier today Trump has said he stands by Mike Wolfs. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=129.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=135.18s)]
*  He said that in an interview with NBC News that he stands by the national security advisor [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=136.18s)]
*  who apparently inadvertently added a journalist to this signal text thread. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=141.34s)]
*  We do also have a post from the press secretary. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=148.98000000000002s)]
*  I think we can pull that up for our viewers where she essentially talks about how no classified [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=151.54s)]
*  information was shared in this thread. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=156.74s)]
*  But the White House and other White House and other officials, I should note Pete Hexsott, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=158.9s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense, have really put the journalist in this case on blast, Jeffrey [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  Goldberg. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=169.62s)]
*  There you see Carolyn Levitt's statement that says, Jeffrey Goldberg is well known for his [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=170.9s)]
*  sensationalist spin. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=175.46s)]
*  Here are the facts. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=177.18s)]
*  She goes on to lay out some of the things that the White House says. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=178.18s)]
*  No war plans were discussed, no classified material being sent in this thread. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=181.9s)]
*  Nonetheless, still sensitive information about potential U.S. strikes against the Houthis [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=186.66s)]
*  in Yemen before it played out. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=194.02s)]
*  This journalist was able to get a hold of that information because he was on this thread. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=196.88s)]
*  You saw it there in the hearing the director of the CIA and the director of national intelligence [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=202.04s)]
*  being asked about the situation with this signal chat thread. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=208.56s)]
*  And in some instances, Tulsi Gabbard simply kind of deferring the question, not necessarily [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=215.44s)]
*  answering the question directly. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=222.48s)]
*  The White House has verified the authenticity of this conversation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=225.56s)]
*  You heard from the CIA director himself. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  I talked about that he was on this signal chat thread. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=231.4s)]
*  But still lots of questions around here as to how this happened and what's going to happen [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=233.84s)]
*  later and whether or not any federal laws were violated in this information being presented [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=238.92s)]
*  on a non-secured commercially available app, MUCO. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=245.28s)]
*  On the schedule for President Trump today is a closed door meeting with Vice President [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=251.52s)]
*  J.D. Vance. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=255.84s)]
*  So what role did the VP play in this group chat? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, this is presumably the first time the president and vice president will have an [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=260.76s)]
*  opportunity to chat about the situation if it does come up. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=266.52s)]
*  But one of the key things that happened in this conversation, according to the Atlantic, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=271.04s)]
*  was a debate about essentially bailing out Europe, a person who appeared to be J.D. Vance [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=276.67999999999995s)]
*  in this text thread talking about how the U.S. military being in the region, being able [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=283.52s)]
*  to respond in this way, was bailing out Europe in large part because the belief was coming [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=290.4s)]
*  from Vance, how the conversation was described from J.D. Vance was that the U.S. taking this [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=296.21999999999997s)]
*  move to strike essentially benefits Europe, that they're able to not necessarily play [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  on the military world stage and counteract this terrorism essentially in the region from [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=308.6s)]
*  the Houthis in this way, to put airplanes in the air to attack the Houthis. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=314.56s)]
*  The U.S. is doing that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=319.6s)]
*  Europe benefits because in large part a lot of trade by European nations goes through [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=321.68s)]
*  that part of the world. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=326.6s)]
*  That was the argument here. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=327.92s)]
*  And J.D. Vance apparently, according to this article, argued about delaying the attack [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=329.72s)]
*  and there was a lengthy discussion about that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=335.0s)]
*  But this was certainly something that played out, should have played out behind closed [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=338.28000000000003s)]
*  doors, but we're really getting a peek inside of how debate is playing out and how the Vice [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=342.72s)]
*  President thinks about foreign policy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=349.48s)]
*  And one of the things that I'll point out as a statement from the V.P.'s team is essentially [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=352.44s)]
*  that he is standing in line with the President, supports the President's priorities, but it's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=356.96s)]
*  interesting to see the Vice President on a different side, playing devil's advocate here, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=363.64s)]
*  so to speak, in terms of how this discussion was being handled. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=369.6s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm sure none of this is over yet. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=373.84s)]
*  Willie James-Edmond from the White House, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=376.8s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BYAho5CdXc&t=380.08s)]
