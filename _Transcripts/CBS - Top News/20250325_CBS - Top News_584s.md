# Former Trump administration official reacts to Signal group text story from The Atlantic
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4)
*  I want to bring in Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a former national security advisor [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=3.2s)]
*  in the first Trump administration, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=5.44s)]
*  of course, four-star general. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=6.74s)]
*  So, General, you know, I recall, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  I can't remember exactly what device it was, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=12.88s)]
*  but I remember President Obama in his first term, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  he wanted, I think he wanted to stay with his BlackBerry [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=18.04s)]
*  or his iPhone, I can't remember which one, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=20.14s)]
*  but whatever one that wasn't secure, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=21.88s)]
*  do you recall which one it was? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=24.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was a BlackBerry, it was a BlackBerry. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=26.92s)]
*  He wanted to stay with a BlackBerry, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=29.38s)]
*  and national security officials said, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=31.259999999999998s)]
*  you cannot stay with a BlackBerry [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=33.56s)]
*  because they're not secure, you can't continue to use it, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=35.16s)]
*  and even though he loved using his BlackBerry, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=37.46s)]
*  he ultimately had to switch. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=40.019999999999996s)]
*  Of course, we all remember what happened [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=41.36s)]
*  with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=43.0s)]
*  former Secretary of State, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=44.34s)]
*  when it was discovered that she was using [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=46.099999999999994s)]
*  a private email server. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=47.64s)]
*  We had hearing after hearing on the Hill. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=49.04s)]
*  I know that it was all politics, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=51.94s)]
*  but there was a real reason for those concerns, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=53.78s)]
*  which is the ability for foreign adversaries [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=56.440000000000005s)]
*  or foreign adversaries to have access to this information. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=59.58s)]
*  So even if you think it's great [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=62.78s)]
*  that the American people have a little bit of insight [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=64.38s)]
*  to how brilliant these guys are [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=66.78s)]
*  in planning an attack on the Houthis, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=68.82000000000001s)]
*  are there laws that are potentially broken here? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=70.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there are, and every administration, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=75.26s)]
*  new administration, is kind of a chaotic period, Vlad, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  and you get breakdowns like this. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=81.26s)]
*  What I'd like to see is just, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  the administration should just own it and say, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=84.8s)]
*  yeah, we made a mistake. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=86.34s)]
*  We're not gonna do that anymore. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=87.5s)]
*  But also, Vlad, what we need is something [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=88.7s)]
*  that's more convenient for, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=91.98s)]
*  not the most classified conversations, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=93.94s)]
*  not for war plans, certainly, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=96.54s)]
*  but for just routine communications. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=98.98s)]
*  I mean, there's not like a government app [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=100.86s)]
*  to make routine communications more secure. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=103.86s)]
*  We need that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=106.22s)]
*  That can conform with like the Presidential Records Act [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=107.5s)]
*  as well, Vlad, which requires you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=109.82s)]
*  to retain those communications and retain those records. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=111.4s)]
*  These kinds of classified conversations, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  they should be held in a specially compartmented [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=117.94s)]
*  intelligence facility, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=122.14s)]
*  like the Situation Room of the White House, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=123.78s)]
*  and then if you have somebody traveling, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=125.88s)]
*  you connect them via secure communications. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=127.46s)]
*  Because, hey, our adversaries, they're all over us, Vlad. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=130.14s)]
*  I mean, they're trying to get into your systems [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=134.1s)]
*  through encryption, break encryption like this, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=137.38s)]
*  but also onto hardware. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=140.7s)]
*  So it's really important to have [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=143.02s)]
*  secure communications facilities when you're discussing [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=145.18s)]
*  these top secret, most sensitive issues. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=148.26000000000002s)]
*  So can you explain to our viewers, then, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  how in a perfect world it's supposed to work? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=153.62s)]
*  Because what Jeffrey Goldberg alleges is that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=156.98000000000002s)]
*  he watched in real time the attack on Houthi forces [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  play out as described by the detailed plan of attack [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=163.98000000000002s)]
*  that Defense Secretary Pete Hagseth [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=169.78s)]
*  shared in this group chat. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=171.7s)]
*  So given that this is a commercially available app, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=173.66s)]
*  any one of us can use Signal, how should it happen? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=177.54s)]
*  How should national security officials, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=180.98s)]
*  the Defense Secretary and others communicate with each other [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=183.22s)]
*  or watch in real time as an attack that's been planned happens? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=186.54s)]
*  So this was a part of the Principles Committee [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=192.26s)]
*  of the National Security Council. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=194.72s)]
*  What this is are the heads of departments and agencies [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=196.14s)]
*  who have relevance to national security decision-making [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=200.34s)]
*  and who help the president by giving him best analysis [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  and teeing up options, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=206.42000000000002s)]
*  making recommendations to the president. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=209.26s)]
*  These kinds of conversations would typically happen [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=211.34s)]
*  in person mainly in the situation room of the White House. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=214.06s)]
*  The national security advisor convenes that group, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=217.22s)]
*  presides over that group. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  If somebody's traveling remotely, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=222.58s)]
*  you bring that person through secure communications, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=224.62s)]
*  which you can do on an airplane, you can do in a vehicle [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=227.06s)]
*  or preferably you move that person into a US embassy [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=229.82s)]
*  that has this kind of intelligence facility. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=233.18s)]
*  I mean, that's all hard, it's not super convenient. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=235.62s)]
*  And I think what happened here is they traded off [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=238.26s)]
*  security for convenience, you just can't do that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=240.78s)]
*  So every administration has like a big issue like this [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=243.14000000000001s)]
*  when they come in, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=246.36s)]
*  because people don't get trained properly, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=247.22s)]
*  it's coming together on the fly, right? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=250.14000000000001s)]
*  They're all traveling to Saudi Arabia, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  they're going to Moscow, they're moving. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=253.86s)]
*  So what you need is time out, okay? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=255.78s)]
*  Let's all get our procedures in place. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=259.38s)]
*  I think what we're fortunate about here, Vlad, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=262.7s)]
*  is that you had a very responsible journalist, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=265.54s)]
*  who kept this to himself until after the strikes were over. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=268.14s)]
*  So of course, this was a breach. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=271.86s)]
*  I mean, I think what we wanna see [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=275.06s)]
*  is you wanna see the administration learn from it [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=276.22s)]
*  and put some appropriate procedures in place [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=278.54s)]
*  to make sure this never happens again. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=281.38s)]
*  Yeah, you raise a good point, General, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=283.86s)]
*  which is that Jeffrey Goldberg, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=285.22s)]
*  not only did he not reveal the name [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=287.24s)]
*  of a foreign intelligence operative, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=290.22s)]
*  one of our foreign intelligence operatives, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  who was named in these text messages [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=295.02000000000004s)]
*  by I guess, I believe the defense secretary. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=298.42s)]
*  But the other thing that's been reported [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=300.86s)]
*  is that Steve Witkoff, who's a special envoy, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=302.7s)]
*  who's trying to put an end to the war in Ukraine, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=304.94s)]
*  was actually in Moscow while this was happening, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  and allegedly might have been involved, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=310.1s)]
*  might have been one of those members of the group chat, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  the group text. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=315.90000000000003s)]
*  So the question, of course, is, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=316.74s)]
*  and you will know this in your former role [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=317.7s)]
*  as a cabinet official, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=320.42s)]
*  how easy would it be for the Kremlin or Vladimir Putin [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=322.02s)]
*  to figure out what's going on on a signal app [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=325.42s)]
*  while Witkoff is literally in the Kremlin? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=328.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm telling you, Vlad, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=332.46000000000004s)]
*  don't even bring your phone to Russia. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=334.18s)]
*  I mean, don't bring your computer to Russia. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=336.26s)]
*  I mean, or other places, China. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=338.9s)]
*  You don't carry your devices. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=342.9s)]
*  Whenever I traveled, I brought a burner phone with me. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=344.41999999999996s)]
*  You leave everything behind. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=347.5s)]
*  And of course, that doesn't eliminate the risk [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=349.06s)]
*  because they're coming after you all the time, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=351.18s)]
*  They're trying to get not only into your phone [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=353.46s)]
*  in a way that allows them to get through encryption, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=355.94s)]
*  but also they try to compromise hardware. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  They collect on you directly. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=360.9s)]
*  I mean, they are extremely persistent [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  in terms of the nature of the threat there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=366.21999999999997s)]
*  So, hey, you have to take all countermeasures. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=367.78s)]
*  It takes discipline to do that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  It takes training. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=372.18s)]
*  I mean, even though you got the vice president [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=373.26s)]
*  who was the senator, I mean, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=375.86s)]
*  but you have others who really don't have much experience. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=377.62s)]
*  And it's important upfront in the chaos [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=381.14000000000004s)]
*  of this administration coming together to take time out. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I'm thinking back, Vlad, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=388.26s)]
*  to like the Kennedy administration, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=389.5s)]
*  They came in kind of the same attitude. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=391.38s)]
*  Hey, we're gonna move fast, break things. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=393.5s)]
*  We're gonna be disruptive. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=395.06s)]
*  Forget all those procedures [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=396.3s)]
*  from the Eisenhower administration. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=397.94s)]
*  We're the whiz kids, right? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=399.70000000000005s)]
*  We're gonna make decisions quickly, informally. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=400.98s)]
*  And you know what you get out of that, Vlad? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=404.42s)]
*  You got the Bay of Pigs out of that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=405.58000000000004s)]
*  So we don't have anything that serious, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=407.22s)]
*  but I think it's time to learn from this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=409.78000000000003s)]
*  And to put the procedures in place, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=412.78000000000003s)]
*  there are people on the permanent staff [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=415.5s)]
*  of the National Security Council, on the NSC staff, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=418.34000000000003s)]
*  who help with this. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=422.62s)]
*  It's their jobs. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=423.64000000000004s)]
*  Now, hopefully they haven't gotten doged. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=424.48s)]
*  They haven't gotten moved out of government, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=426.70000000000005s)]
*  but you need some of that professional staff [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=430.02s)]
*  to help you with this. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=432.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure Elon Musk is wondering, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=433.38s)]
*  hey, why wasn't I included in that? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=435.82s)]
*  Somebody's head is gonna roll. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=437.41999999999996s)]
*  And speaking before we go, General, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=439.5s)]
*  I mean, should somebody lose their job? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  You point out that there may not be a lot of experience. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=442.79999999999995s)]
*  I get it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=446.17999999999995s)]
*  Pete Hegseth was a former talk show host, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=447.02s)]
*  but Mike Waltz is a decorated Army Special Forces Colonel. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=450.14s)]
*  He was a congressman. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=454.09999999999997s)]
*  He would presumably have some insight [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=455.21999999999997s)]
*  into how this stuff works, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=457.29999999999995s)]
*  and allegedly he was the one who invited Goldberg [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=458.82s)]
*  into the chat. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=462.06s)]
*  So should there be accountability? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=462.98s)]
*  I know that this president isn't always one [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=465.90000000000003s)]
*  for holding folks accountable [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=468.18s)]
*  because he thinks that any time you hold someone accountable, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=469.94s)]
*  you're admitting that you made a mistake, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=473.38s)]
*  but should somebody be held accountable, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=474.82s)]
*  just objectively speaking here? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=476.98s)]
*  Well, I think people should be held accountable [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  just to fix the problem. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=481.66s)]
*  But I think the country, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=484.1s)]
*  we all need this administration to succeed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=485.54s)]
*  And I think this administration has a much better chance [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=488.58s)]
*  to succeed with Mike Waltz in his position. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=490.98s)]
*  Now, I might be hurting him with some people [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=493.42s)]
*  by saying that, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=495.62s)]
*  but I really think that, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=497.78s)]
*  what's interesting about this conversation too, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=500.46s)]
*  that we all have out in the open, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=503.18s)]
*  is kind of the nature of the debate that's going on [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=505.06s)]
*  within the administration [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=507.82s)]
*  between those who I would call the retrenchers, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=509.38s)]
*  Those who think we should kind of disengage [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=512.6s)]
*  in these complex challenges abroad [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=514.6600000000001s)]
*  and let other people deal with them, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=516.4200000000001s)]
*  like the Europeans and others, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=517.9000000000001s)]
*  and those who are like the America first people [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=519.58s)]
*  for President Trump, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=522.3000000000001s)]
*  but who have a more internationalist perspective [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=523.7s)]
*  and a more active approach, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=526.0600000000001s)]
*  not only to foreign policy, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=527.4200000000001s)]
*  but also to national security [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=528.86s)]
*  and the need in this case, right? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=530.46s)]
*  To remove this threat to international shipping [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=531.94s)]
*  from the Houthis. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=534.58s)]
*  And what this debate shows us [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=536.1s)]
*  is that at least that debate is going on. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=538.14s)]
*  And that's kind of a good thing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=540.98s)]
*  You want that debate to go on within the administration. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=542.54s)]
*  I think Mike Waltz represents an important perspective there. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=545.22s)]
*  It seems to me like he's playing kind of the honest broker [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=549.5s)]
*  to get everybody's views. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=552.18s)]
*  Now we didn't want to read that on signal, right? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=553.58s)]
*  That should be happening within the situation room, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=555.66s)]
*  but I think Mike Waltz gives the president [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=558.82s)]
*  a much better chance of success in these matters. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=561.62s)]
*  You're right about that, General. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=565.34s)]
*  As Americans, no matter which political divide you fall on, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=567.3s)]
*  you want the president of the United States, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=570.54s)]
*  and thus his cabinet to succeed [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=572.1s)]
*  because it makes all of us safe, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=573.58s)]
*  makes all of us better. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=575.66s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think we're in agreement on that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=577.26s)]
*  Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=579.38s)]
*  always great to have you, sir. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=581.14s)]
*  Thank you so much, as always, appreciate it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEGA7ZX2Jl4&t=582.22s)]
