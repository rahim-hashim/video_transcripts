# The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg on why he published Hegseth's texts on Yemen bombing
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM)
*  CBS News, senior White House and political correspondent, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=0.0s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe is standing by with us now to talk more [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  about the administration's response to all this. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=5.04s)]
*  Ed, it's still difficult to really let it all sink in. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=7.2s)]
*  I know that you, though, had a chance to speak with the man [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=10.0s)]
*  at the center of this firestorm, Atlantic editor Jeffrey [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=13.0s)]
*  Goldberg. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=15.64s)]
*  What was that conversation like? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=16.68s)]
*  What did he tell you? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=18.28s)]
*  Well, we began by asking him why he decided to publish [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=19.96s)]
*  that classified information. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=22.68s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=24.12s)]
*  Why did you publish what you published? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=26.96s)]
*  Because of Tuesday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=29.08s)]
*  Because on Tuesday, the president of the United States [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  said there's nothing classified or sensitive in the emails, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=32.92s)]
*  in the texts, and because various other national security [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  officials said the same thing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=42.64s)]
*  Among other things, they're now calling you an anti-Trump hater. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=44.36s)]
*  I don't hate Donald Trump. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=49.92s)]
*  Just reporting on a White House, that's all. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=51.76s)]
*  I mean, this is, and I'm not the first reporter [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  they do this to. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  Anytime you write something they don't like, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=58.52s)]
*  they call you bad names. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  Makes a good point, Errol. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  I think if any reporter was put on something like that, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=65.64s)]
*  you'd report it out and eventually share it [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=68.0s)]
*  with your readers or your viewers. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=70.56s)]
*  And that's what Jeffrey did. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=71.88s)]
*  It was so important for you to speak with him. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=73.68s)]
*  And I know that your extended interview is available online [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=75.92s)]
*  for folks to watch. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=78.34s)]
*  I encourage folks to check out that conversation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=79.64s)]
*  But Ed, I want to switch to another topic while we have you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=82.72s)]
*  The president made this announcement yesterday [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=85.48s)]
*  that tariffs, 25% on foreign-made vehicles, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=87.4s)]
*  goes into effect in less than a week. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=90.2s)]
*  What is the reaction to that announcement thus far? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  Somewhat positive reaction from the labor movement, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=94.68s)]
*  who is quite pleased to see the president continuing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=97.12s)]
*  to promote and sort of insist on American manufacturing. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  But there are concerns, of course, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=103.64000000000001s)]
*  and warnings from the auto industry [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=105.0s)]
*  that if these tariffs go into effect on essentially cars [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  that are being made or assembled in Mexico and Canada [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  and then sent here for sale, that the price [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  is going to go up big time. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  And so if you're someone who's concerned about that, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=116.44s)]
*  hurry up and get to the lot and pick out something fast [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=119.2s)]
*  because those tariffs are set to begin next week. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=122.32s)]
*  What still isn't clear, Errol, is what exactly [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=124.72s)]
*  these tariffs will do, what exactly they will target, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=128.32s)]
*  or who, because the president, in essence, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=131.12s)]
*  shifts and keeps it vague every day. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=133.28s)]
*  And these have a way of moving the market up or down [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=135.04s)]
*  as he does this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=137.8s)]
*  And we'll see today how the market reacts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=138.6s)]
*  Already, futures suggest that the auto industry itself [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=140.8s)]
*  could take a hit, at least in the early hours of trading. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=143.28s)]
*  We'll watch it. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=145.88s)]
*  Yeah, trading to begin in about two hours from now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=146.6s)]
*  Ed O'Keefe at the White House. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=148.76s)]
*  Ed, thanks very much. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHB4XQ-A5JM&t=149.8s)]
