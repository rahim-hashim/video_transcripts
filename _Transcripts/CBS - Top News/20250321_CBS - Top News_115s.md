# London's Heathrow Airport closed due to major power outage from nearby fire
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4)
*  In the UK, London's Heathrow Airport will be closed all day because of this, a massive [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=0.0s)]
*  blaze at a nearby electrical substation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=6.22s)]
*  Those flames are now under control, but it caused a massive outage, knocking out power [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=9.9s)]
*  to thousands of homes and businesses, and of course causing major travel disruptions. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=14.02s)]
*  Ian Lee joins us now live from Heathrow Airport following this story for us. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=18.66s)]
*  Ian, good morning to you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=23.22s)]
*  What caused this fire? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=24.42s)]
*  Good morning, Errol. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=28.98s)]
*  That's something that they're looking into right now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=29.98s)]
*  And do you know, the local member of parliament said that they don't believe there was any [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=32.86s)]
*  foul play, but this is a huge disruption. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=37.78s)]
*  Typically, this guy would be buzzing with activity, flights taking off and landing, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  but it's been brought to a complete standstill. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=46.66s)]
*  And there are now hundreds of thousands of people who would be traveling today, and they're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=49.18s)]
*  waking up with this news, this nightmare. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=53.94s)]
*  Shortly before midnight local time, this fire erupted at that substation, about three miles [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=56.699999999999996s)]
*  from where I'm standing, sending flames and smoke into the sky. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=61.9s)]
*  Dozens of firefighters and 10 engines battled the blaze through the night, only bringing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=65.53999999999999s)]
*  it under control just a few hours ago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=70.46s)]
*  Fortunately, though, no one was injured, but it did knock out power for tens of thousands [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=72.86s)]
*  of homes while disrupting more than 1,300 flights. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=77.9s)]
*  At Europe's busiest airport, 120 planes already in the air turned around, while others that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=82.62s)]
*  were closer to London were diverted to nearby European cities. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=88.1s)]
*  Airlines have canceled around 500 flights to and from the U.S., and they're looking [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=92.74s)]
*  into this cause, but it could take some time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=98.06s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're hoping that they can get flights back off the ground as early as tomorrow. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=101.82s)]
*  Errol? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=107.02s)]
*  Yeah, Heathrow is such a congested place. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=108.02s)]
*  The Turks will need to travel with patience today in Europe for sure. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=110.42s)]
*  Ian, thank you very much. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mcp-RB4Np4&t=113.54s)]
