# Breaking down contentious hearing in Trump deportation flights case
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Major Garrett in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight on America Decides, Demands for and from the Department of Justice. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=2.08s)]
*  A federal district judge who temporarily blocked the Trump administration's deportation flights [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=7.68s)]
*  hold a contentious scaring. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=12.4s)]
*  As lawyers from the Justice Department, rather, are grilled almost from the very beginning [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=15.08s)]
*  on what they knew about the flights and why they ignored his order to turn them around. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  Also, future fighter jet President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Air Force's newest aircraft. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  It's called the F-47, which the Pentagon says will have a longer range and more advanced [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=31.88s)]
*  stealth capabilities. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=37.92s)]
*  This is a gift to my kids and your kids, to my grandkids and your grandkids. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=40.16s)]
*  This is a historic investment in the American military, in the American industrial base, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  in American industry that will help revive the warrior ethos. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=51.56s)]
*  Also, Elon Musk at the Pentagon, as President Trump denied a report that, that is to say, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=56.88s)]
*  Musk was going to be briefed on the U.S. military's top secret plan for a potential war with China. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=63.28s)]
*  We'll have more on that in just a second. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=68.56s)]
*  I want to begin tonight with Jake Rosen, who joins me here at the desk. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Jake, you were witnessing, not in the courtroom, but adjacent to it in the media room, this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=74.4s)]
*  very contentious hearing. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=79.92s)]
*  Walk us through what happened, the basics. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=82.08s)]
*  Well, that's right, Major. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=83.8s)]
*  At the top of this hearing, after a week of this kind of ping pong back and forth of court [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=84.84s)]
*  filings, President Trump, Elon Musk, all getting involved, calling for this judge's ouster, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=88.92s)]
*  he called the Department of Justice attorney right in front of him off the top of the hearing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=93.88s)]
*  and said on Saturday night, when this whole saga started, did you understand my order [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=97.08s)]
*  verbally in court to say, and did you relay it then to the government, that I wanted these [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=102.08s)]
*  two planes carrying alleged trend Aragawa gang members turned around? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=107.96000000000001s)]
*  The attorney said yes, and then he asked, did you go and tell the government? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=112.36s)]
*  He said yes. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=115.08s)]
*  Again, this is at the root of this entire back and forth in which the government has [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=116.08s)]
*  not provided any information outside of when those planes left U.S. airspace because they [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=120.2s)]
*  claim once they left U.S. airspace, the judge's decision hadn't been officially put into writing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=124.96s)]
*  in the court docket and therefore he had no decision or no ability to turn those planes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=129.68s)]
*  around. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  And it wasn't, if not invalid, it wasn't operationally significant that the planes had left and they [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  were going to go to El Salvador, no matter what. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=139.68s)]
*  And that the president has authorities outside in his military capacity to order a military [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=142.48s)]
*  plane wherever he wants it, whenever he wants it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=147.44s)]
*  It's also been said this week, you were mentioning this back and forth, and President Trump and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=150.76s)]
*  Elon Musk, there is some suggestion out there that this federal district judge wanted to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=154.92s)]
*  release the Venezuelans in question. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=160.67999999999998s)]
*  Did the judge address that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=163.32s)]
*  Yeah, and it was the second point after he called this lawyer, Drew Ensign, up. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=164.56s)]
*  He said, I would like to make something clear for the record. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=168.66s)]
*  And he asked, Mr. Ensign, do you understand it that I did not, in my order on Saturday [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=170.7s)]
*  night, order any release of any alleged Tren de Arga or other gang members out onto the [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=174.54s)]
*  streets? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=180.14s)]
*  And he said, yes, that has not happened. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=181.14s)]
*  Then he said, did you also understand it that I have not ordered any, that to stop any of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  these other machinations around this that have been alleged that, you know, there were [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=189.22s)]
*  a pause, a broader pause on these deportations generally? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=192.98s)]
*  Because that has been put out there by the president that Donald Trump has said, or even [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=197.14s)]
*  earlier today, saying that he believes that this judge wants to stop all deportations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=201.04s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=205.2s)]
*  The judge said out loud that these deportations outside of the invocation of the Alien Enemies [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=206.2s)]
*  Act may continue. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=210.55999999999997s)]
*  And where do things stand now? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=212.64s)]
*  Right now, going into Monday, as of 5 p.m., there will be an appeals court hearing on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=214.64s)]
*  Monday to appeal that judges, this judge, James Boesberger's original order on Saturday [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=218.88s)]
*  these deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=224.84s)]
*  The second step is he's deciding whether or not to tailor his temporary restraining order [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=228.8s)]
*  to potentially allow people who are in the U.S. illegally and who are Tren de Arga gang [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=233.0s)]
*  members to say, if they are detained, I am a gang member and I would like to be deported. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=236.96s)]
*  I'm not going to contest this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=241.16s)]
*  His order right now currently blocks any deportations of people who currently may admit to being [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  a gang member. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=247.8s)]
*  So he's going to potentially look at that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=248.8s)]
*  He's also going to take further steps and ask for briefing potentially on what the government [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=250.96s)]
*  and what the plaintiffs believe is going on in terms of vetting these people, as we've [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=255.32000000000002s)]
*  reported all week, to make sure that the people who the government has already deported and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=258.16s)]
*  to make sure the people who the government plans on deporting, of which there are over [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  250 people, to make sure that there are either administrative steps or legal steps taken, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=265.6s)]
*  to make sure that it's not just a broad accusation that, hey, you might be a gang member, therefore [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=270.72s)]
*  you're gone, to make sure there are proven steps that these people are, A, Venezuelan, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=274.48s)]
*  over the age of 13 and C, actually parts of the gang, not just potentially affiliated [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=278.82s)]
*  on the fringes with the gang. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=283.14s)]
*  Cenk Rosen, thank you very, very much. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=284.46s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=286.54s)]
*  I want to bring in Charlie Daggett, who joins us from the Pentagon. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=287.54s)]
*  Charlie, always great to see you. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=289.94s)]
*  Let's start with the story that got a lot of attention yesterday late. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=291.26s)]
*  New York Times, Wall Street Journal saying when Elon Musk came this morning to the Pentagon, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=295.46s)]
*  he was going to be read in or briefed in some manner or form on a top secret potential war [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=299.7s)]
*  plan for China. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=305.2s)]
*  What do we know about that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=306.2s)]
*  Major, to be honest, it's been a frenetic day here at the Pentagon, yet another frenetic [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=308.5s)]
*  day. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=313.9s)]
*  So, Elon Musk arrived around 9 a.m. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=314.9s)]
*  He left at 10 20. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=317.42s)]
*  He met directly with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=319.06s)]
*  But even before he arrived, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell furiously denied that Musk was [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=322.06s)]
*  going to be briefed on China, even going so far as to demand that the New York Times retract [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=327.9s)]
*  that story. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=333.42s)]
*  But here's where it gets even murkier. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=334.42s)]
*  Musk was invited to discuss innovation and technology, right? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=337.18s)]
*  So, we both know he's got multiple defense contracts here, stands to reason that China [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=339.82s)]
*  would come up in those discussions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=344.78s)]
*  The New York Times story suggests that Musk was briefed on classified information regarding [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=347.02s)]
*  China, specifically what the military calls O-plans or operational plans, and that includes [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=353.5s)]
*  top secret slides, potential targets, etc. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=358.68s)]
*  And Musk has skin in the game, both here at the DOD, where billions of taxpayer dollars [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=361.9s)]
*  going into his programs, including SpaceX that we know about, but he's also heavily [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=365.74s)]
*  invested in China. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=370.1s)]
*  So, every single source that I spoke to today said Musk did not have any classified briefings [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=371.1s)]
*  on China. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=376.86s)]
*  He said President Trump and Hegseth repeated those assertions. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=377.86s)]
*  Now, whether he was originally planned to sit in on those classified briefings and then [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=380.90000000000003s)]
*  maybe they modified it after that story broke, we don't know or they won't say. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=386.1s)]
*  The stories are true at the Pentagon, lots of different parts of Washington and the rest [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=393.06s)]
*  of the country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=396.7s)]
*  Charlie, we all do sympathize with that. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=397.7s)]
*  Talk to our audience about the F-47. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=399.66s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=401.86s)]
*  How long has it been in development? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=402.86s)]
*  And do we know anything at all about how much it might cost per unit? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=404.7s)]
*  OK, well, first of all, no prizes for guessing why it was called the F-47. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=408.22s)]
*  No. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=412.46s)]
*  It might just be—that might just be a happy accident. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=413.46s)]
*  Patently obvious. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=417.06s)]
*  It might just be a happy accident that coincides with the 47th president of the United States. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=419.7s)]
*  The president just called it a beautiful number. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=424.14s)]
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to comment. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=426.18s)]
*  But anyway, it's been called by President Trump as the most advanced, capable, most [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=428.46s)]
*  lethal aircraft ever built. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=432.82s)]
*  Interestingly, he said it can operate alongside drones, because that's the next-stage technology. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=434.86s)]
*  And the Air Force, we spoke to them today, they kind of echoed that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=439.68s)]
*  It's supposed to be—I'm using military terms here—adaptable and collaborative combat [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=442.58s)]
*  aircraft. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=446.9s)]
*  is the way they describe it. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=448.9s)]
*  So it's obviously top secret, but stealth, long-range strike capabilities, adaptable. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=450.14s)]
*  It's the next step forward from the F-22 fighter jet. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=455.78s)]
*  It's been called a generational leap forward. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=459.62s)]
*  And actually, that's not much of an exaggeration, because we're almost looking at a generation [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=462.21999999999997s)]
*  since the last fighter jet. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=466.38s)]
*  It's obviously got air-to-ground capabilities, but it also has air-to-air capabilities, which [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=468.06s)]
*  is vital in any kind of dogfight scenario with China. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=473.34s)]
*  And officials confirmed, yes, it's been five years in development. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=477.58000000000004s)]
*  That includes a pause under the Biden administration, where, as it's been explained to me, they [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=480.58000000000004s)]
*  reevaluated it in terms of cost and relevance. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=486.06s)]
*  And as far as delivery goes, the Air Force—and Boeing, for that matter, obviously—promised [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=488.74s)]
*  that the F-47 will fly during President Trump's administration. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=493.98s)]
*  The first phase obviously includes integrating and testing all of the platforms. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=497.86s)]
*  They're going to produce a small number of test aircraft. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=502.46000000000004s)]
*  Ultimately, in terms of cost, estimates are around $20 billion, each aircraft costing [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=506.62s)]
*  roughly $300 million once production is up and running. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=512.0600000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's a very big number. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=515.1s)]
*  Charlie Daggett, with all the details, thanks so very much. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdaYyb3qu7U&t=516.58s)]
