# Trump to start process to dismantle Department of Education
**CBS - Top News:** [March 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo)
*  Power the pen and right off the top, the work to dismantle the Department of Education. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=0.0s)]
*  So you see President Donald Trump, he's going to start that process today with the signing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=4.84s)]
*  of his first executive order to abolish that department. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=9.36s)]
*  So what is this all about? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  Well, if you ask the White House, they will tell you national test scores reveal what [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=13.72s)]
*  they call a crisis and that quote, our children are falling behind. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  They also add this language saying millions of illegal minors coming into the country [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=21.16s)]
*  are straining school resources and diverting focus from American students. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=25.36s)]
*  And they also say coupled with the rise of anti-American critical race theory and diversity, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=30.0s)]
*  equity and inclusion indoctrination, harms are most vulnerable, close quote. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=34.28s)]
*  So let's get to the tricky part here. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Closing the department does not happen by executive order. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=41.6s)]
*  Doing that actually requires an order from Congress, an act of Congress. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  So to get granular on this, we're talking about the need for 60 votes in the Senate. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=49.44s)]
*  So knowing they have to get to 60, think about it this way, Republicans only have a 53 to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=53.88s)]
*  47 seat advantage. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=59.32000000000001s)]
*  You know what we're talking about here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=60.68000000000001s)]
*  That means they would need seven Democrats to get this passed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=62.0s)]
*  And that's if every single Republican senator is on board. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=65.64s)]
*  Now let's go back in time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=69.92s)]
*  In 2024, the Department of Education had a $268 billion annual budget. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=70.92s)]
*  And the DOE says billions goes to high poverty K through 12 schools, 15.5 billion to teach [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=75.56s)]
*  children with disabilities and $1.6 trillion for federal student loan programs. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=82.32s)]
*  So a lot to break down here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=88.24s)]
*  CBS News White House reporter Willie James Inman live with us today from the White House [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=89.36s)]
*  lawn. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=93.6s)]
*  So Willie, what are the people who depend on those programs where all of those millions [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=94.6s)]
*  of dollars are assigned there in the list we just talked about? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=98.8s)]
*  What are they bracing for? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=101.08s)]
*  Hey there, Reed, good to be with you on this first day of spring. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=104.6s)]
*  Well, the White House says that those programs, including the ones that you mentioned, the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  Title One programs and those programs that hand out student loans, taking those payments, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=111.0s)]
*  those will still be handled by the Department of Education. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  But the president in signing this executive order is going to start to essentially diminish [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  the department, cut down on the department. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=124.8s)]
*  We've already seen half of the workforce at the Department of Education fired, basically [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=127.88s)]
*  let go. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=133.92s)]
*  We have seen the Trump White House move towards dismantling the Department of Education. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=135.2s)]
*  And this is the start of that step with this executive order the president is signing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=140.6s)]
*  today. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  But as you pointed out perfectly, he will need Congress to fully get rid of the Department [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  of Education because it was created during the Carter administration by an act of Congress. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=151.2s)]
*  So the president cannot just unilaterally do this on his own. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=156.68s)]
*  But for now, at least those programs that millions of Americans depend on will still [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=160.48s)]
*  remain at the Department of Education. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=165.28s)]
*  There's a thought here at this White House that student loans and other types of programs [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=167.88s)]
*  that are handled by the Department of Education will be handled by different departments once [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=172.88s)]
*  it is eliminated. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=178.08s)]
*  So Willie, got to ask you in thinking about it this way, there is the executive order [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=179.84s)]
*  and then there's the general, so to speak, who then executes that order and implements [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=183.52s)]
*  it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=188.0s)]
*  We're talking about Linda McMahon. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=189.0s)]
*  Any signal from her office about first steps? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=190.0s)]
*  Well, we've already seen part of this in a memo that the Secretary of Education essentially [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=194.4s)]
*  talked about the final task, summing it up here, of the Department of Education to not [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=202.4s)]
*  only to continue to give out those funds, to continue to run those programs, but to [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=207.96s)]
*  really hand this over to the states. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=214.68s)]
*  Of course, there's no curriculum set, so no national curriculum set by the U.S. government. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  The states handle hiring teachers, handling curriculum across the board, but the Department [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=223.36s)]
*  of Education is saying that they want to get out of the business of really handling any [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=229.56s)]
*  type of education funding. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=235.36s)]
*  They want to hand that over to the states. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=240.58s)]
*  They don't want to necessarily control it at the federal level. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=242.32s)]
*  So that's part of the messaging here, to give this back to the states. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=245.34s)]
*  And Linda McMahon, the Education Secretary, has said as much previously in interviews [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=248.88s)]
*  and during her testimony on Capitol Hill as well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=253.56s)]
*  Reid. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=256.4s)]
*  Well, and you know, going into you, we had that statement that talked about, at least [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=257.4s)]
*  from the Trump administration's point of view, that doing this could eliminate critical [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=260.92s)]
*  race theory being taught in schools. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=265.52s)]
*  But we've heard from K-12 teachers all along that that is not taught K-12. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=272.88s)]
*  I'm glad you pointed that out. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=276.08s)]
*  A few years ago, I did some reporting in Texas about this specific issue, that this was not [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=277.67999999999995s)]
*  a, this is not something that is taught at the K-12 level. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=283.67999999999995s)]
*  Critical race theory really is a complex topic, a complex way of looking at things that is [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  taught at the collegiate level. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=293.55999999999995s)]
*  Universities, colleges around the country perhaps use that, but it is not taught at [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=295.79999999999995s)]
*  the K-12 level. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=300.2s)]
*  It's important to point that out because it's really a complicated topic to even get [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=301.2s)]
*  into, let alone students, of course, are focused on reading, writing and different [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=306.0s)]
*  things. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=311.2s)]
*  They're not necessarily focused on this particular topic as well. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=312.2s)]
*  But despite that, conservatives, Republicans, including this White House, have really targeted [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=314.92s)]
*  critical race theory. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=321.4s)]
*  There have been some folks out there who have said that they want to get out of the business [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=322.4s)]
*  of DEI or critical race theory. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=327.08s)]
*  So you saw that statement there from the White House deputy press secretary. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=329.2s)]
*  They're saying that it doesn't matter what you call it necessarily. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=334.56s)]
*  They want to make sure that they're not funding or the U.S. government isn't funding any of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=337.44s)]
*  these programs perhaps in an indirect way. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=341.16s)]
*  So that's a different way of going about it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=344.56s)]
*  But still nonetheless, this is certainly something that the president has said he wanted to do [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  previously and is following through with his executive order to start to dismantle the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  Department of Education today later at 4 p.m. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=355.64000000000004s)]
*  read. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=358.40000000000003s)]
*  Some important things to talk about and some distinctions the voters do deserve and need [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=359.40000000000003s)]
*  to know about. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=362.88s)]
*  Meanwhile, top heavy hitters in education telling Mr. Trump, see you in court. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=363.92s)]
*  Willie, it's so great to talk to you. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=367.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for helping us to deeper understand that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=369.4s)]
*  You bet. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXKuBIrDRo&t=371.76s)]
