# What we know about the Tufts University student detained over pro-Hamas accusations
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8)
*  Okay, you see this video to our monitor shows the arrest of a doctoral student enrolled [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=0.0s)]
*  at Tufts University by federal agents. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=4.92s)]
*  This dramatic confrontation happening on the sidewalk in Massachusetts. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=7.86s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=13.6s)]
*  So the sounds of distress there. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=15.66s)]
*  Well, her attorney says the 30-year-old was on her way to break Ramadan fast with friends. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=17.2s)]
*  So let's bring in CBS News National investigative correspondent Tom Hanson. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=21.740000000000002s)]
*  What did the woman arrested have to say in a newspaper article there at the school that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=26.419999999999998s)]
*  caused those who arrested her to do what they did? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=30.86s)]
*  Yeah, well, read what we understand is that she wrote an op-ed in 2024 that was essentially [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=34.14s)]
*  denouncing the conflict going on in the Middle East and saying that Tufts University, where [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  she was getting her doctor's degree, that they needed to divest from Israel and also [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=47.2s)]
*  denounce the Palestinian genocide. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=53.7s)]
*  You played that video earlier and I just want to give our viewers some context as to where [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  we're standing right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=59.14s)]
*  We found the exact spot where this incident took place. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=60.14s)]
*  That very disturbing incident, as we've heard from so many residents here, has now turned [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=64.22s)]
*  into this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=68.14s)]
*  And I want to give you guys a look. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=69.14s)]
*  People have been dropping off flowers here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=70.38s)]
*  And then if you pan up, you can see that there is a sign that says, ice kidnapped our neighbor [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=72.34s)]
*  Rumeysa Oz Turk 325 2025. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=78.58s)]
*  That QR code right there, that goes to a website for people who want to find out their rights [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=81.5s)]
*  either as visa holders or as citizens. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=88.62s)]
*  But just take a look over here. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=92.06s)]
*  You can see that this community is a very tight knit community. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  Homes are right next to each other. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=96.82000000000001s)]
*  No doubt several people, plenty of people on this block were hearing this all unfold. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=98.94s)]
*  We spoke to one person who walked by the incident as it was taking place. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=104.46s)]
*  He tells us that he wasn't sure if this was a kidnapping happening in broad daylight or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=108.86s)]
*  if that was law enforcement that was detaining Oz Turk. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=113.94s)]
*  And so there was a lot of confusion, a lot of concern and a lot of outrage from people [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=117.74s)]
*  in this neighborhood as they watched this scene unfold. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=122.1s)]
*  We're told that people here felt helpless when they found out that this was being carried [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=124.61999999999999s)]
*  out by ICE officials and law enforcement. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=130.5s)]
*  So now Rumeysa Oz Turk, as far as we know, is at a detention facility that is in Louisiana [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=133.92s)]
*  and that defies federal district judges orders to give about two days notice before removing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=140.72s)]
*  her from the state of Massachusetts. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  Currently we are waiting for a lot of questions to be answered here, Reid. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and what do we know about her because if she's in the United States, she's a student, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=153.92s)]
*  she's well invested in her program there at Tufts University. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  What do we know about her? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=161.86s)]
*  Yeah, well, Oz Turk herself, one of the many elite students here at Tufts University, as [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=163.58s)]
*  you know, Reid, this is an elite institution. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=172.68s)]
*  We know that she was pursuing a doctoral degree. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=175.56s)]
*  We also know that she had a health condition, asthma, which was released in a court document [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=181.36s)]
*  in the last 24 hours. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=187.82000000000002s)]
*  She is from Turkey, so a Turkish national as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=190.4s)]
*  But we are really trying to piece together exactly who Oz Turk was. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=195.06s)]
*  We do know from friends of Oz Turk that she reportedly was not involved in any sorts of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=200.32s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protests that happened on the campus. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=209.48s)]
*  The only thing that they know is that she wrote this op-ed in 2024 denouncing Israel's [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=215.01999999999998s)]
*  bombing of the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=221.7s)]
*  But beyond that, there are still so many questions to be answered, Reid. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=224.26s)]
*  Do you know what her attorneys say about what she's charged with? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  Because that's going to come up in court and will likely be the next part of this national [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=232.82s)]
*  conversation, the specific charges. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=235.98s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=238.66s)]
*  We don't know that she has any charges. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=240.66s)]
*  In fact, DHS officials say that she is being detained under the Immigration and Nationality [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=243.02s)]
*  Act. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=252.38s)]
*  That's actually grounds that is being used to detain a Columbia student who was leading [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=253.38s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protests on Columbia's campus, which you may remember that scene, Reid. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=258.48s)]
*  And so this is uncharted territory, but as far as we know, neither of those two have [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=265.3s)]
*  been charged with the crimes they are being held and very much wondering what their fate [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=270.96s)]
*  is going to be. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=276.44s)]
*  CBS News National investigative correspondent and always great to take us right there to [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=277.88s)]
*  the scene where things happen. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  Tom Hanson, good to talk to you, my friend. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHJ-s3GLaq8&t=283.35999999999996s)]
