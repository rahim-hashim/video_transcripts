# U.S. officials meeting with Russians in Saudi Arabia on Ukraine ceasefire talks
**CBS - Top News:** [March 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y)
*  Turning now to the war in Ukraine, U.S. and Russian officials are meeting today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia for ceasefire talks. Yesterday, National Security Advisor [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=4.86s)]
*  Mike Wallace told Face the Nation an agreement is starting to take shape. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=8.94s)]
*  Listen. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime ceasefire so that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  both sides can move grain, fuel, and start conducting trade again in the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=19.8s)]
*  Black Sea. And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front line [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=25.22s)]
*  and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=29.98s)]
*  freezing the lines where they are, and then of course the broader and permanent [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=36.7s)]
*  peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=41.92s)]
*  peace and a lasting peace. All right, CBS News contributor Samantha Vinograd [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=46.94s)]
*  joins us now. She's a national security expert and she's coming to us from [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=54.06s)]
*  Washington this morning. So, Sam, both sides agreed in principle on a ceasefire. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=57.7s)]
*  So what can we expect? Well, Vlad, it's getting a little hard to keep track of [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=62.5s)]
*  which ceasefire we're talking about exactly because there have been so many [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=66.88s)]
*  iterations. In the first instance, President Trump on the campaign trail [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=70.18s)]
*  mentioned that he would end the war, a permanent ceasefire, within 24 hours. We [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=74.06s)]
*  then graduated to a more limited 30-day ceasefire. Last week we heard discussions [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=78.62s)]
*  after President Trump spoke individually with President Putin and then President [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=84.61999999999999s)]
*  Zelensky about a ceasefire affecting energy infrastructure. And then more [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=88.66s)]
*  recently, over the last day or so, we heard about a ceasefire impacting the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=93.1s)]
*  Black Sea and maritime transit that is really, really critical to global [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=98.0s)]
*  food markets and global grain markets. And so now what we're waiting to hear is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=104.25999999999999s)]
*  if there is any agreement whatsoever on a ceasefire of any kind, whether it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=109.58s)]
*  limited to a particular sector, a particular domain, whether it be air, land, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=113.66s)]
*  or sea, and whether both sides are able to come together and agree on a set of [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=118.1s)]
*  infrastructure or geography that will be off limits for some period of time. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=122.42s)]
*  So how vital is the area surrounding or close to the Black Sea to any deal? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=127.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, the Black Sea is absolutely critical to world grain markets and just [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=134.18s)]
*  overall food markets around the world. So it's not just Ukraine that has an [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=140.54s)]
*  interest in resuming grain exports through the Black Sea. It's also low-income [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=145.62s)]
*  countries that depend very heavily on grain that's exported through these [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=150.82s)]
*  critical shipping lanes. Now, back earlier in the war in 2022, Turkey and the United [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=156.14s)]
*  Nations negotiated an agreement whereby various vessels could pass through the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=162.5s)]
*  Black Sea. The war had already started but could pass through the Black Sea with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=167.86s)]
*  critical grain exports so as to avoid a meltdown in global food markets around [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=171.34s)]
*  the world. That initiative lasted about a year and then it faltered, which has led [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=179.66s)]
*  to a huge plummeting in grain availability around the world, which again, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=183.9s)]
*  really is impacting low-income countries. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=188.74s)]
*  And Sam, just remind us again why this diplomacy is going through Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=191.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, are they looking to see themselves and perhaps have the world see them as a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=197.14s)]
*  major player when it comes to regional disputes like this, even if they're not in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  their sphere of influence? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=207.78s)]
*  Well, Saudi Arabia is not the first country that comes to mind when you think [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=210.29999999999998s)]
*  about negotiating an end to the war between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=214.1s)]
*  But certainly, Mohammed bin Salman, the ruler of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=217.57999999999998s)]
*  has invested a lot of time, energy and resources to restore the image of the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=222.06s)]
*  kingdom after the kingdom was accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi several years [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=226.78s)]
*  ago. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is certainly trying to position itself as a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  mediator, as a trusted ally of not just the United States but of other countries [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=236.86s)]
*  around the world, and as a go-to partner when trying to solve issues that are [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  affecting geopolitics on a larger scale. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=246.22s)]
*  So I think we should expect to see more of Saudi Arabia in the mediation space, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=248.7s)]
*  much like, for example, we've seen Qatar play this role in other conflicts, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  including the Middle East conflict that's waging between Israel and Hamas right [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=257.53999999999996s)]
*  now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=261.18s)]
*  All right, Samantha Vinograd for us this morning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=262.62s)]
*  Sam, thank you so much. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sakhnQLxn6Y&t=264.53999999999996s)]
