# Stocks plunge as new data signals inflation concerns
**CBS - Top News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg)
*  The Dow is down following growing uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=0.0s)]
*  With just an hour to go in the trading week, the Dow is currently down almost one and three [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=4.64s)]
*  quarters of a percent, a little more than 700 points. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=9.72s)]
*  The S&P and NASDAQ remain down a little more than 2 percent for most of the trading day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  The core personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, the Fed's preferred [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  inflation measure, ticked up last month more than economists had forecast and signaling [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=21.72s)]
*  that price hikes remain stubbornly high. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=26.84s)]
*  Joining me now is Paul Lamonica, senior market analyst writer at Barron's. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=28.720000000000002s)]
*  Why are we seeing this, Paul? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=33.88s)]
*  Yeah, this is brutal. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=35.92s)]
*  I think that a big part of it, as you mentioned, the PCE, personal consumption expenditure [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=37.44s)]
*  numbers that came out this morning, did show that core inflation was a little bit higher [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=43.28s)]
*  than expected. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=50.56s)]
*  That's obviously the inflation numbers that back out food and energy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=51.68s)]
*  The market had really been starting to believe that inflation is cooling, and I think it [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=59.68s)]
*  still is. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=65.38s)]
*  The problem is that it's sticky, it's persistent, it's not going down as quickly as we'd like [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=66.6s)]
*  it to see. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  You couple that with worries about maybe inflation going higher again because of tariffs that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=73.28s)]
*  have already been implemented and even more they're about to kick in. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=79.0s)]
*  There's a lot of anxiety on Wall Street about what's going to happen to consumer spending, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=82.64s)]
*  what's going to happen to auto sales with the auto tariffs. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=87.76s)]
*  It's sort of cliche to say Wall Street hates uncertainty, but guess what? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=91.88000000000001s)]
*  Wall Street hates uncertainty. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=96.32000000000001s)]
*  We've had a couple of days like this, Paul. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  Give us a big picture of where we're at and what are you going to be watching for the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=99.44s)]
*  next few days, especially April 2nd coming next week? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=102.28s)]
*  More tariffs set to take effect. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=105.2s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=107.0s)]
*  When you look at the markets, we're down for the year, but we're still not terribly far [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=109.2s)]
*  off of some of the all-time highs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  The S&P 500 is no longer in what's called a correction, which is more than 10% below [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=117.56s)]
*  a recent peak. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  That is good news if you want to consider that it could be worse. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=126.12s)]
*  I think what everyone's going to be looking for is what happens with those tariffs on [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=130.56s)]
*  April 2nd. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=135.64s)]
*  Are they going to kick in and then that's going to be it and we face a new kind of world [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=137.1s)]
*  that countries are going to have to adjust to when it comes to trading with America? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=142.34s)]
*  Will there be room for more negotiations, be it last minute before the April 2nd deadline [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=148.29999999999998s)]
*  or afterwards? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=153.22s)]
*  We know President Trump loves making deals. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=154.4s)]
*  And then also, don't forget next week, the jobs report for March comes out on Friday. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=158.1s)]
*  That's going to be something that Wall Street is looking closely at because if there's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=164.52s)]
*  weakness, particularly on the government sector because of all those doge cuts, that could [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=169.08s)]
*  be a concern. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  And the jobs numbers also have, as part of that, a figure called average hourly earnings, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  which is wage growth. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=181.0s)]
*  When wages are going up pretty dramatically, that's usually a sign of inflation. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=182.46s)]
*  So if wages start to cool, that may not sound like great news for consumers who want bigger [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=187.24s)]
*  paychecks, but it would actually be welcome news to Wall Street and the Federal Reserve. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  It might allow the Fed to start cutting interest rates again later this year because they'd [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=197.5s)]
*  be less worried about prices and more worried about a slowing economy. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=201.95999999999998s)]
*  Paul Lamonica, thank you so much. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=207.11999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2S4KQv5vEg&t=209.83999999999997s)]
