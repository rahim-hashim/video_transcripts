# White House expresses confidence in Waltz after Atlantic story on Yemen bombing texts
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk)
*  But let's begin with that security breach that has everyone talking. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=0.0s)]
*  A journalist says he was included in a text group chat with top Trump officials who were [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  discussing sensitive secret war plans. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=8.36s)]
*  The editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, published a piece yesterday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=11.0s)]
*  He says he was added to a chat on the commercial messaging app known as Signal and that it [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=14.88s)]
*  happened earlier this month. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=20.92s)]
*  Now, those in the group chat included the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegson, Vice President [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=22.48s)]
*  J.D. Vance and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and a lot of other cabinet officials, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=27.78s)]
*  the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  Now, Goldberg claims that the chat involved top U.S. officials discussing sensitive plans [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=36.82s)]
*  to attack Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=41.5s)]
*  I found it completely improbable that the top national security leadership in the United [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=44.38s)]
*  States would be discussing on a commercial messaging app the possible imminent attack [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=50.7s)]
*  on another country. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=57.82000000000001s)]
*  We have a responsibility to alert the American public in a democracy that this is what the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=58.74s)]
*  government is doing, this is how the government is thinking about problems and when you discover [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=65.9s)]
*  a massive security breach, it's our responsibility to report that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=71.86s)]
*  Our Eleanor Watson is traveling with the Defense Secretary and she actually asked him about [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=79.02s)]
*  all of this, about what happened. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  Here's what he told her. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=86.34s)]
*  You're talking about a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who's made [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=88.3s)]
*  a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=95.7s)]
*  Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  I want to bring in CBS News White House reporter Aaron Navarro to talk about this. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=104.54s)]
*  So first of all, Aaron, Jeffrey Goldberg late last night on CNN or another network responded [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=110.38000000000001s)]
*  to what this Defense Secretary said, called him a liar. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  Has the Defense Secretary responded to that claim that he's not being factually correct [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=121.30000000000001s)]
*  when it comes to the allegations that are being made? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=125.86000000000001s)]
*  We haven't heard yet from Secretary Hegseth but even what he said is kind of in conflict [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=129.26s)]
*  with what came out of the National Security Council who confirmed the message thread was [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=134.73999999999998s)]
*  authentic and kind of spun it as a quote demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=139.45999999999998s)]
*  between senior officials. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=145.14s)]
*  Again, that's their spin as the White House and the cabinet continue to play damage control. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=146.54s)]
*  But I want to start with President Trump this morning who told NBC in an interview that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  advisor Mike Waltz quote has learned a lesson and he's a good man. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=156.22s)]
*  President Trump again told NBC that it's a non-issue and said it's quote a glitch in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=160.82s)]
*  the last two months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=165.38s)]
*  We here at CBS News have been hearing some chatter amongst those who were already critics [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=166.86s)]
*  of Mike Waltz in the White House. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=171.62s)]
*  Start to get in the president's ear potentially about releasing him, asking him to resign, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=174.36s)]
*  firing him. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=179.18s)]
*  But White House press secretary Caroline Levitt reiterated just minutes ago that Trump [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=180.18s)]
*  continues to have confidence in Waltz who is reportedly the person that added this Atlantic [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  reporter to the Signal Group chat and threw doubt on stories claiming otherwise. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=189.62s)]
*  Not only that, he uses emojis just like my 16 year old nephew, fist bump, American flag, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  a fire. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=200.78s)]
*  The other thing Aaron, there's this message from supposedly JD Vance, the vice president, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=202.34s)]
*  essentially going against, this is a guy who is very vocal in support of everything [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=209.02s)]
*  that President Trump, at least since he turned from being an anti-Trump-er a few years ago. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=215.06s)]
*  And in this message back and forth with these other national security officials and cabinet [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=220.46s)]
*  officials, he actually goes against President Trump. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=224.22s)]
*  What is it alleged that he said in that text chat? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=226.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's a fascinating narrative within this story, the disagreement, the debate that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=228.86s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg saw play out in the Signal Group chat. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=233.9s)]
*  The president's director for Vice President Vance said he quote, unequivocally supports [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=238.01999999999998s)]
*  this administration's foreign policy and that Vance and President Trump have talked about [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=241.98s)]
*  this and quote, are in complete agreement. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=246.17999999999998s)]
*  They also said that the VP's priority is quote, always making sure the president's advisors [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=248.82s)]
*  are adequately briefing him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=253.82s)]
*  But Vance, who has said before that he believes Europe should do more when it comes to Russia, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=255.6s)]
*  Ukraine, the economy, showed some real daylight between himself and President Trump in that [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=261.3s)]
*  group chat. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=266.14s)]
*  All right, Aaron, we'll check in with you a little bit later. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vDPgXE6mrk&t=267.14s)]
