# The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg on why he published texts with details on Yemen bombing
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs)
*  You published an article on Monday and withheld certain details. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=0.0s)]
*  You published more on Wednesday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=5.0s)]
*  Why did you publish what you published? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=7.0s)]
*  Because of Tuesday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=9.0s)]
*  Because on Tuesday, the President of the United States said there's nothing classified or sensitive in the emails, in the texts, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=11.0s)]
*  and because various other national security officials said the same thing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=20.0s)]
*  So what we did yesterday was, given that information, we went to the agencies, CIA, DOD, DNI, etc., and said, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=25.0s)]
*  you guys have said there's nothing classified or dangerous in here. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=33.0s)]
*  We're just double-checking with you. Is there anything that you believe, for national security reasons, we should redact? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=38.0s)]
*  The CIA asked us to redact something, and we did. No other agency asked. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=44.0s)]
*  The White House spokeswoman gave us a kind of boring, generic kind of, we wish that you wouldn't do this, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=49.0s)]
*  but there's nothing classified here. It shouldn't even go into that area. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=56.0s)]
*  So the reason to post it is because I think people should see for themselves. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=62.0s)]
*  They're saying nothing happened. I'm saying that this represents a serious breach in national security and communications. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=66.0s)]
*  And so, you know what? That's what journalism is for. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=72.0s)]
*  Go look at it for yourselves and decide if this represented a serious breach of secrecy in national security. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=75.0s)]
*  But based on your decades of covering national security, when you initially saw this, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=82.0s)]
*  you had concern that there was something in there that the public shouldn't see. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=88.0s)]
*  It sent a chill down my spine. I mean, I'm getting on my phone, sitting in a supermarket parking lot, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=92.0s)]
*  and I'm getting a plan from the Secretary of Defense about an attack that's coming up in two hours. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=98.0s)]
*  And I don't know who else is on the Signal Chat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=105.0s)]
*  I mean, that's actually extremely dangerous to say that American warplanes are launching in 30 minutes to attack Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=108.0s)]
*  There's only so many Houthi targets in Yemen. If that information had fallen to the wrong hands, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=117.0s)]
*  not my hands sitting in a locked car in a parking lot, in a safeway parking lot, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=122.0s)]
*  if that had fallen to the wrong hands, American pilots would be in even more danger than they are [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=127.0s)]
*  simply by participating in an attack on an enemy with anti-aircraft capabilities. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=132.0s)]
*  So I was astonished, shocked, appalled. You name the word, I'll give it to you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=137.0s)]
*  But withholding it was because pilots were at risk, potentially exposes how top officials talk to each other about this? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=143.0s)]
*  Well, not how top officials talk to each other about it. That's interesting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=152.0s)]
*  And that's a policy, that's substance, that's policy. That is very interesting to me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=156.0s)]
*  I don't, even as someone who covers national security, I'm less interested in the technical details, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=160.0s)]
*  especially of an immediately forthcoming attack, the weapons packages, what time they're doing it, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=166.0s)]
*  what the weather is, etc., etc. I'm less interested in that than I am in the why. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=171.0s)]
*  Why are you attacking Yemen now? And then after the fact, did the attack work? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=176.0s)]
*  What are the goals of the attack? How many people died? How many guilty people died? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=181.0s)]
*  How many innocent people died? You know, the large questions. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=184.0s)]
*  But I don't need that information. And the truth is, I don't want that information. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=188.0s)]
*  I'm not qualifying to handle that information. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=193.0s)]
*  And I recognize, even as a reporter who wants to know everything, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=197.0s)]
*  I recognize that there are some things for operational reasons should not be discussed lightly. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=201.0s)]
*  But what you have here is the Secretary of Defense discussing in a signal chat, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=205.0s)]
*  doesn't even know that the editor of the Atlantic is in the signal chat, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=210.0s)]
*  and is giving out precise timings and sequencing of an attack on a very dangerous enemy of the United States. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=214.0s)]
*  When you are getting that information sitting in the parking lot of the supermarket, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=221.0s)]
*  and you're seeing it in real time, did you think to yourself, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=226.0s)]
*  I got to call a lawyer? I should call the White House and let them know I have this? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=231.0s)]
*  What was your reaction in real time? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=236.0s)]
*  I thought that I was part of a chain that was part of a disinformation campaign. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=238.0s)]
*  I thought this was part of a disinformation campaign. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=243.0s)]
*  It didn't make any sense to me at all that U.S. government officials, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=246.0s)]
*  national security officials, would be communicating this way at all. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=250.0s)]
*  I thought I was being entrapped. I don't know by who, by a foreign state actor, by a non-state actor. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=253.0s)]
*  I don't know who, but I did not think that this was real. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=259.0s)]
*  And I thought to myself sitting there looking at my phone, well, I guess I'm about to find out if it's real. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=263.0s)]
*  And so at 1.30, precisely when Pete, 1.50, I'm sorry, precisely when in that period, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=269.0s)]
*  when Pete Hex had promised the group that the first bonds would fall, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=275.0s)]
*  I start searching on the Internet and finding out that, oh yes, there are attacks going on in Sanaa, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=281.0s)]
*  the capital of Yemen, the Houthi capital. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=286.0s)]
*  And I thought, okay, now we're in a different, now I'm in a different position. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=288.0s)]
*  So obviously I consulted with colleagues and others and I began the process that led to the writing of these stories. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=292.0s)]
*  And one of the criticisms we've seen is you learned about this on March 15th. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=298.0s)]
*  You didn't publish until March 24th. Why wait? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=304.0s)]
*  Well, I wanted to get the story right. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=309.0s)]
*  And it takes a while to figure some things out. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=313.0s)]
*  But what I did do was I left the group because that seemed like the responsible thing to do. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=317.0s)]
*  But I had to get a lot of things right. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=323.0s)]
*  And this is serious stuff and I'd rather not rush. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=326.0s)]
*  The White House has called you a lot of things. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=330.0s)]
*  They do this when there's somebody that's sharing or reporting information they don't like. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=333.0s)]
*  They don't like a lot of reporters. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=337.0s)]
*  No, and they discredit the messenger or the publication. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=339.0s)]
*  Or they try to discredit the messenger at least. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=342.0s)]
*  Well, among other things, they're now calling you an anti-Trump hater. Are you? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=344.0s)]
*  I don't hate Donald Trump? No, not at all. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=349.0s)]
*  Just reporting on a White House. That's all. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=352.0s)]
*  I mean, this is, and I'm not the first reporter they do this to. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=355.0s)]
*  Anytime you write something they don't like, they call you bad names. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=359.0s)]
*  I have to imagine that you've been called bad names from time to time. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=363.0s)]
*  Although you're such a likable person, I can't imagine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=366.0s)]
*  It happens. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=369.0s)]
*  But the truth of the matter is, in this case in particular, they included me in the chat. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=371.0s)]
*  I was in the chat. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=380.0s)]
*  They're screaming and yelling about my character. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=382.0s)]
*  All I did was look at my phone. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=385.0s)]
*  So if I'm such a nefarious individual, why is Mike Waltz, why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=388.0s)]
*  Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=395.0s)]
*  And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=400.0s)]
*  about the way an administration is contemplating military action? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=403.0s)]
*  What do they really think is going to happen? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=407.0s)]
*  We're going to report it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=409.0s)]
*  You're going to report it. Of course you're going to report it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=411.0s)]
*  It's in the public interest. That's literally what we do. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=413.0s)]
*  We hold government officials accountable in the public eye [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=416.0s)]
*  so the voters and citizens of the United States can see what their leaders are doing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=420.0s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=424.0s)]
*  In essence, what you've done today is say, okay, they say this isn't classified information. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=426.0s)]
*  Here it is. You reader, you citizen decide for yourself. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=432.0s)]
*  We're stimulating a conversation about what is appropriate for government officials [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=437.0s)]
*  to put into private messaging apps. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=441.0s)]
*  One of the other interesting elements of this is the National Security Advisor is now saying [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=445.0s)]
*  he never knew you, wouldn't have been able to pick you out of a police lineup. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=451.0s)]
*  Had you ever met Mike Waltz before? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=454.0s)]
*  I'm not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=456.0s)]
*  I'm just not going to comment on it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=459.0s)]
*  Someone watching might find that suspicious, but as a reporter, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=461.0s)]
*  you're potentially not commenting on someone who may or may not have been on it. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=464.0s)]
*  I'm just not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=468.0s)]
*  You've seen photos, though, that surfaced today of you two at an event several years ago [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=472.0s)]
*  standing next to each other, which suggests you've met before. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=477.0s)]
*  I mean, the photos are, I mean, if your eyeballs see us together, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=480.0s)]
*  then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=485.0s)]
*  The other argument they're making is that you somehow got yourself into the group. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=488.0s)]
*  That's not technologically possible, right? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=494.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, you're talking to a guy who barely knows how to use screenshot on his phone. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=496.0s)]
*  Yes, I've seen people, including Mike Waltz, say that somehow I secretly inserted my phone number into a signal or, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=504.0s)]
*  I don't know, this kind of crazy stuff. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=514.0s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=517.0s)]
*  On March 11th, I got a message request from Michael Waltz. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=518.0s)]
*  I accepted the message request. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=521.0s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=525.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=526.0s)]
*  And users of Signal know that if that happens, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=527.0s)]
*  it's because your phone number has been inserted into that other person's phone. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=529.0s)]
*  A person who has your phone number asks to talk to you or communicate with you on messaging through Signal. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=533.0s)]
*  That's all. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=539.0s)]
*  There are a lot of people who may be reading up or tuning into this a few days into it [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=541.0s)]
*  and may think to themselves, why does this matter? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=547.0s)]
*  What is this other than Washington pointing fingers at each other again over something silly? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=551.0s)]
*  It's important. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=556.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=557.0s)]
*  It's important. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=558.0s)]
*  I think it's important to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=559.0s)]
*  There's obvious proof here that, A, national security officials were talking about real-time intelligence [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=565.0s)]
*  and military information on an open-source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=572.0s)]
*  Put aside the fact that they didn't even know who was in the group because I was in the group and I'm not supposed to be in the group. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=579.0s)]
*  I think when reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=586.0s)]
*  The hope then is that things get fixed. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=592.0s)]
*  You can attack the messenger, which seems to be the style here, or you can just say, oh, I guess we had a big breach. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=596.0s)]
*  We better fix it and make new rules governing the use of our cell phones and Signal apps and other apps. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=603.0s)]
*  That would be sort of the logical thing to do, but that's not what's happening here. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=610.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, the point is that the public has a right to know how government officials handle sensitive information on their behalf, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=613.0s)]
*  ultimately on the behalf of the citizens. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=622.0s)]
*  We also have a right to know how decisions are made within a democratically elected government. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=624.0s)]
*  The conversations that they're having about whether or not to attack Yemen, the public should know how they think about these things. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=631.0s)]
*  The public interest here is profound. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=639.0s)]
*  This is not just bickering about a technical issue. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=642.0s)]
*  One of the other striking things that maybe hasn't gotten as much attention is the vice president was an active participant in this conversation. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=647.0s)]
*  The national security adviser, the defense secretary and a deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=654.0s)]
*  But you also had the White House chief of staff, the secretary of state, the director of national intelligence, the CIA director, and a handful of others also privy to this chat in the group. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=661.0s)]
*  And sometimes participating in the chat. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=671.0s)]
*  They all would have known that sharing this information in this kind of a setting may not be the safest thing to do. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=673.0s)]
*  Nobody, though, at any point in the conversation ever spoke up and said, hey, maybe we should all meet about this or get on a phone or not do this in this setting. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=682.0s)]
*  Look, I've heard from a lot of people who are much more junior in the government, state department, military, etc. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=693.0s)]
*  And they say that if they behave this way, they would be fired or prosecuted. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=701.0s)]
*  In other words, even in United States embassies, security officers go through at night and look for classified information that somebody mistakenly left out of their desk. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=706.0s)]
*  You could lose your job for leaving a piece of paper on your desk. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=714.0s)]
*  So, you know, it's unbelievable to me that the senior most officials in the United States don't know how to handle classified or sensitive information. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=719.0s)]
*  Which makes you wonder, are there other people down the ranks who are being equally careless? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=730.0s)]
*  Or does this now encourage people to be as careless in the future if their bosses aren't getting in trouble? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=736.0s)]
*  And there's another question, which is, are there other signal groups that we don't know about? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=743.0s)]
*  I'm going to assume yes. I have no proof. But if you do this once, you probably do this quite frequently. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=749.0s)]
*  Look, it's very convenient to just use your own phone and go on an app that has been described as secure. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=755.0s)]
*  Obviously, it's not secure if you invite the wrong people into the app, as we all have learned, probably in less serious circumstances over the years, putting together a group or texting the wrong person. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=763.0s)]
*  But this is an important issue for any number of reasons, including the fact that it is a test of accountability, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=772.0s)]
*  If a Marine captain or an Air Force officer or a State Department employee could get into loads of trouble for having poor communications and security hygiene, then the Secretary of Defense, the CIA director? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=780.0s)]
*  I mean, these are the questions that I think people on Capitol Hill are asking. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU3f0UhKkZs&t=798.0s)]
