*  The orders signed this week restrict the firms from working with federal agencies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  The firms have represented and employed President Trump's political opponents. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, two other law firms have entered into agreements with the White House to avoid [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=19.28s)]
*  sanctions. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=24.72s)]
*  CBS News justice correspondent Scott McFarland has more from Washington. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=25.799999999999997s)]
*  A flurry of activity in the courts late into the night Friday night. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=31.52s)]
*  Some of the largest and most name-brand law firms in America fighting to stay alive, to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=35.36s)]
*  stay in business. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=40.72s)]
*  They accused the Trump administration of targeting them with executive orders that would be a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=42.4s)]
*  basic death sentence for firms like Wilmer Hale, firms like Perkins-Cooey. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  And they've been in court challenging the executive orders that have put them in dire [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=53.279999999999994s)]
*  straits. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=56.919999999999995s)]
*  The Trump administration has threatened to strip the attorneys at those firms of their [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  security clearances or of their ability to do business in government buildings or with [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=61.64s)]
*  government workers. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=66.24s)]
*  And on Friday, the president said another firm who's been on the radar, Skadden, has [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=67.24s)]
*  agreed to a settlement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=73.0s)]

*  pro-bono work for causes or organizations the president does not object to. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=78.84s)]
*  There's concerns this is a chilling effect on law firms nationwide. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  There will be fewer firms and fewer lawyers willing to take cases challenging the administration [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=88.68s)]
*  for people who need help with a veterans benefit or a Social Security check, a federal worker [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=93.36s)]
*  who's lost his or her job or has a back pay issue. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=97.88s)]
*  These lawsuits will continue in the courts, but in the meantime, the Trump administration [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  continues to exert its influence over America's major law firms from coast to coast. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=105.04s)]
*  For CBS Saturday Morning, Scott McFarland, Washington. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsrB-aIqVs&t=110.92s)]
