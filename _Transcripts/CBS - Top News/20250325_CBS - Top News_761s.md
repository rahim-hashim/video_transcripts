# NSA warned about using Signal a month before leak of Houthi strike chat
**CBS - Top News:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Major Garrett in Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight on America Decides, What is the Signal and What is the Noise? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  A journalist mistakenly received Trump administration war plans in advance of an attack on Houthis [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=7.08s)]
*  in Yemen. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=12.0s)]
*  This stunning security lapse coming his way on an unsecured commercial app known as Signal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=13.24s)]
*  Was the information classified? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=19.6s)]
*  Were laws broken? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=20.92s)]
*  Could this lead to a shakeup within Trump's national security team? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=22.52s)]
*  Among those texting about the secret plans, including quote, operational details unquote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=26.4s)]
*  were National Security Advisor Mike Walt and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=31.88s)]
*  Nobody was texting war plans and that's all I have to say about that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=36.28s)]
*  I inadvertently discovered a massive security breach in the way the national security establishment [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  conducts its business. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=46.32s)]
*  It was not great timing for the Trump administration, but it was pretty good timing for all those [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=48.0s)]
*  with questions about this snafu. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=52.82s)]
*  Today top intelligence officials held their annual Senate hearing on worldwide threats [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=56.0s)]
*  and there, Democrats took the opportunity to push for more answers on this whole war [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=60.28s)]
*  plans chat group while Republicans worked as best they were able to minimize the damage. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=65.52s)]
*  This is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=72.88s)]
*  towards classified information. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=81.28s)]
*  It's not a good thing. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=83.12s)]
*  Again, it will be up to the president to see how he wants to handle it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=84.12s)]
*  I'm sure it's a mistake that's been corrected right now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=87.56s)]
*  So many other questions. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=91.16s)]
*  Had there been warnings, for example, from allies, from tech firms, and even from within [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=92.16s)]
*  the Pentagon about the dangers of using Signal to discuss any sensitive information or plans? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=95.72s)]
*  And how about those U.S. military raids against Houthi targets? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=102.56s)]
*  Were they a success? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  The White House says unequivocally yes and adds, that's all that really matters. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  But who are the Houthis? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=111.56s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=112.56s)]
*  And will this aggressive new Trump-era military campaign against them reopen shipping or increase [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=113.72s)]
*  the risk of a wider Middle Eastern war? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=120.16s)]
*  Our goal in the next hour? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=122.72s)]
*  Sort out as much of this as possible. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=124.76s)]
*  And of course, we will have the deluge of reaction from Capitol Hill and reminders about [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=126.48s)]
*  past political statements regarding the care required in handling classified information. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=131.72s)]
*  I want to start tonight with Finn Gomez and James Laporta and Nicole Killian. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=137.48s)]
*  James, I want to start with you because you have brand new reporting on a bulletin issued [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  regarding Signal from the NSA. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=146.28s)]
*  I do. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=149.56s)]
*  So today, CBS News obtained a bulletin that went out to all NSA employees in February [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=150.56s)]
*  2025. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=156.8s)]
*  So this is a month before the Houthi Signal chat was created. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=157.8s)]
*  What this bulletin basically said was it detailed the vulnerabilities of using Signal, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=163.58s)]
*  one of them being that they have information that Russian hacking groups are using Signal [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=170.42000000000002s)]
*  to send out phishing scams in order to bypass the encryption software that Signal uses to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=177.18s)]
*  get into chat rooms. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=183.10000000000002s)]
*  And that way, Russian hackers can see the actual chats, the messages going back and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=184.62s)]
*  forth. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=190.18s)]
*  It also detailed how, even if it's unclassified information, it should not be on Signal whatsoever. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=191.5s)]
*  Unclassified information, controlled unclassified information, or anything that dealing with [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=201.26s)]
*  for official use only information should not be on Signal, period. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=205.94s)]
*  So this is a bulletin issued under the National Security Agency's Aegis, the Trump administration's [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=209.7s)]
*  National Security Agency, to everyone who might think about using Signal. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=216.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=221.22s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=222.22s)]
*  I mean, the NSA said, you know, use it to communicate with your families and your friends, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=223.22s)]
*  but not to share unclassified information, not to share troop movements and things like [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=229.26s)]
*  that, things that are not classified, things that are not on the top-seeker level. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=233.82s)]
*  So we mentioned this at the top of the show. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=238.38s)]
*  John Radcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, two significant members of the Trump administration in the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=241.02s)]
*  national security realm, were at the Senate hearing and talked about this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=245.74s)]
*  Listen. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=250.42s)]
*  My communications, to be clear, in a Signal message group were entirely permissible and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=252.78s)]
*  lawful and did not include classified information. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=262.7s)]
*  So then, if there was no classified material, share it with the committee. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=265.78s)]
*  So James, I'm curious about this verbal effort today to minimize what this was, because several [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=270.38s)]
*  people, including the president, have suggested this wasn't classified. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=279.14s)]
*  Does that mean that there has been a retroactive declassification of it? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=283.58s)]
*  Because it seems to me, based on my elemental knowledge of these kinds of plans, that in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=287.34s)]
*  the moment, they are definitely classified. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=292.9s)]
*  U.S. intelligence officials that I've spoken to over the past day, members of the U.S. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=295.9s)]
*  military, anybody dealing with classified material does not understand how talking about [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  targeting plans is not classified. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=306.54s)]
*  They don't understand that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=309.82s)]
*  Timing, munitions, target plans. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=311.02s)]
*  Timing, munitions, targets, potential collateral damage reports, things of that nature, those [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=312.02s)]
*  are all on the secret or top secret level. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=317.66s)]
*  But let's say, for the sake of argument, they are. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=321.3s)]
*  Let's say they are unclassified. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=324.14s)]
*  According to the NSA bulletin, they're still violating cybersecurity protocols. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=326.86s)]
*  They're still violating operational security protocols. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=331.1s)]
*  So that's the NSA, and according to intelligence officials and members of the military. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=334.3s)]
*  So regardless if they're classified, they still feel that there's a violation. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=338.38s)]
*  Finn, I want to get to you about what the implications are for National Security Advisor [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=342.18s)]
*  Mike Walz in a moment, but I want to refresh all of our memories about past political statements [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=346.86s)]
*  from Republicans about the need to look out for classified information and to treat it [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=353.06s)]
*  with the utmost care. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=359.1s)]
*  Let's play that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=360.1s)]
*  It is irresponsible for an elected official in her capacity to be discussing highly sensitive [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=362.26s)]
*  things on a format that she had to have known was not fully secured. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=367.06s)]
*  And the risk of that is? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=371.36s)]
*  The risk of that is that we're giving our opponents of this government our adversaries [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=372.82s)]
*  some insight. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=376.62s)]
*  Don't forget, there's 30,000 other emails that she said she deleted about yoga class [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=377.62s)]
*  and gifts, but the FBI has recovered a lot of those. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=382.14s)]
*  If even a few of them contain classified secret or top secret information, that's even more [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  damning. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=389.18s)]
*  Many of us felt that there should have been a prosecution started with respect to Hillary [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=390.18s)]
*  Clinton regarding classified emails. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=395.5s)]
*  You will note, Finn Gomez, that all three of those soundbites come from current members [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=399.26s)]
*  of the National Security Team of the President of the United States. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  And all three members were also in that signal chat. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=405.46000000000004s)]
*  They were indeed. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=407.98s)]
*  Major, no. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=408.98s)]
*  Look, if on Walz. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=409.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=410.98s)]
*  You were asking about Walz earlier. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=411.98s)]
*  We have talked to CBS News, talked to several sources close to the White House, close to [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=413.9s)]
*  the administration on his future, if you will. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=418.58s)]
*  And from early on, he's had his detractors. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=422.7s)]
*  Some have said he is not mega enough, that he's sort of a closet neocon, of course. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=426.38s)]
*  But he has a fervent amount of support also within Trump world. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=430.54s)]
*  We saw that since some of the outcries, some of this backlash, the fallout, if you will, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=434.66s)]
*  since the signal story broke. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=439.7s)]
*  But they have circled the wagons around him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=443.3s)]
*  The president himself was asked about this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=446.98s)]
*  And he said that he does not think that Walz should apologize. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=448.86s)]
*  He's doing his best. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=453.02000000000004s)]
*  And he called him a very good man. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  However, Major, he did ask him to look into this matter. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=455.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=458.34000000000003s)]
*  And the looking into part is the sound I want to play for the audience right now from the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=459.34000000000003s)]
*  president with Mike Walz, the national security advisor, sitting around the table. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=462.02000000000004s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=466.94s)]
*  But it's not a perfect technology. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=468.58000000000004s)]
*  There is no perfect technology. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=470.88s)]
*  The really good ones are very cumbersome, very hard to access. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=472.54s)]
*  I don't think he should apologize. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=478.42s)]
*  I think he's doing his best. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=480.90000000000003s)]
*  It's equipment and technology that's not perfect. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=483.46000000000004s)]
*  And probably he won't be using it again. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=487.42s)]
*  Read the body language there, Finn. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=491.82000000000005s)]
*  The body language is very Trumpian, I think, in the sense that he is supporting his guy, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=493.82000000000005s)]
*  if you will. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=499.90000000000003s)]
*  There's a little bit of distance there, right? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=501.29999999999995s)]
*  And I think privately we have heard that Trump is upset about this. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=503.06s)]
*  He described it as a glitch in public. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=507.9s)]
*  A glitch in public. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  But remember, as we know, Major, we've been covered. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=510.53999999999996s)]
*  They don't acknowledge glitches. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=512.6999999999999s)]
*  And Trump doesn't acknowledge mistakes. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=514.62s)]
*  Very rarely does he make say, I am sorry, or there was a mistake made by administration [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=516.62s)]
*  or by my servants. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=520.6999999999999s)]
*  Because by saying that, by acknowledging that, is a show of weakness. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=522.36s)]
*  And that is something that President Trump does not like to portray. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=525.46s)]
*  This, of course, is a story that ricocheted all around Capitol Hill. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=527.78s)]
*  Also, I want to bring in Nicole Killian to join us for a summation of the reaction from [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=530.3399999999999s)]
*  Capitol Hill. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=535.3s)]
*  Nicole, it's great to see you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=536.3s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=537.3s)]
*  I want to play you kind of a gathering of Republicans outside of the Republican Capitol [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=538.3s)]
*  Hill Club talking about this, and then I'll get you on the other side. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=543.54s)]
*  Let's give it a listen. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=546.8199999999999s)]
*  It was either a horrible mistake or someone did it on purpose to do somebody. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=547.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, my buddy, Mike Walz, is a straight up guy and he's very honest, honorable. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=554.5s)]
*  He's a patriot. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=564.5s)]
*  We all make mistakes. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=565.5s)]
*  So I'm sure that that was not something that he intended or something that he wanted to [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=567.34s)]
*  happen. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=572.5s)]
*  Give him a pass. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=573.5s)]
*  Look, mistakes happen. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=574.5s)]
*  If it was a mistake, it is what it is. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=575.5s)]
*  And you know, it won't happen again. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=580.5s)]
*  I know that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=582.5s)]
*  Nicole, the word of the day, mistake. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=583.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=586.5s)]
*  And that is something that Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated as well, that he believes that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=587.5s)]
*  this was a mistake. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=592.06s)]
*  Also defending Mike Walz and telling reporters just yesterday that he doesn't think that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=593.5s)]
*  he should resign. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=599.14s)]
*  I would note that Mike Walz did resign from Congress earlier this year and his seat is [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=600.14s)]
*  actually up for grabs next week in a special election. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=605.74s)]
*  So even if he did decide to step down, he couldn't necessarily come back to his seat [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=608.82s)]
*  in this body. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=614.82s)]
*  So for now, even on Capitol Hill, many congressional Republicans continue to rally behind him. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=616.0600000000001s)]
*  I would note there is a little bit of daylight when you look at Senate Republicans, though, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=621.1s)]
*  you know, talking to Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, he did say that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=625.38s)]
*  he's been talking to his counterpart on the committee, Jack Reed, that all options are [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=630.38s)]
*  the table as far as they are concerned. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=636.0600000000001s)]
*  So it is an issue where they might try to potentially hold a hearing in the future, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=639.1800000000001s)]
*  seek more information, try to get a hold of that text thread if possible. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=644.0200000000001s)]
*  And that is something that leader Thune reiterated as well. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=648.74s)]
*  So yes, while everybody acknowledges it was a mistake, there are some Republicans who [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=651.9000000000001s)]
*  are willing to look into this further. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=656.62s)]
*  Certainly, congressional Democrats have been very clear. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=658.7800000000001s)]
*  They believe that there should be some sort of congressional investigation. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=660.9000000000001s)]
*  But more of those calls among Republicans tend to be on the Senate side. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=664.6999999999999s)]
*  Perhaps maybe the Senate Armed Services Committee might be that starting point. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=669.62s)]
*  And James, it's evident that Jeff Goldberg, the editor in chief of the Atlantic, is in [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=673.8199999999999s)]
*  possession of much of this unreleased information, which he said he didn't release out of deference [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=678.3399999999999s)]
*  and respect for a sensitive national security process. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=684.3399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=688.18s)]
*  It's very chilling if the safety is coming from someone not in the national security [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=689.42s)]
*  community. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=695.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=696.26s)]
*  But to your point, today, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said it's all unclassified. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=697.26s)]
*  And the common thing we heard from lawmakers was, well, release it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=704.3399999999999s)]
*  Release it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=708.02s)]
*  Let's let the public see it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=709.02s)]
*  But I will tell you, what's really on the line is credibility. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=710.02s)]
*  The American public is going to debate the merits of this. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=713.14s)]
*  People I've been hearing from the intelligence community and the military community have [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=716.78s)]
*  been saying, look, and these guys have also campaigned on this for a while, that if this [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=720.7s)]
*  was a private, if this was a low-level intelligence analyst, the book would be thrown at them. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=725.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=730.62s)]
*  If it was unclassified or if it was classified. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=731.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=734.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=735.14s)]
*  And so now, credibility is on the line, where they're now facing, you know, they're now [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=736.14s)]
*  the senior leaders. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=740.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=741.1s)]
*  And so for these intelligence community members, for the military, it's like, well, you guys [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=742.1s)]
*  have been preaching holding senior leaders accountable, and now you're in this crisis. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=745.6999999999999s)]
*  What is your decision? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=750.8199999999999s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=751.8199999999999s)]
*  That's an excellent way to wrap this up. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=753.8199999999999s)]
*  James Laporta, Finn Gomez, Nicole Killian on Capitol Hill, thanks for getting us off [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=755.02s)]
*  to a great, great start on a very important news day. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO-HOf5JzvQ&t=758.98s)]
