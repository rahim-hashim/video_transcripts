# Trump says he is not joking about seeking a third term as president
**CBS - Top News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE)
*  So this is a big week for the Trump administration you've got new tariffs expected to go into effect [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=0.0s)]
*  Wednesday and President Trump also says he's looking for ways to serve a third term in office [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=5.72s)]
*  He clarified Sunday that he is quote not joking and is exploring methods to do it despite the Constitution [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=11.52s)]
*  prohibiting such a thing [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  More on this let's bring in CBS News correspondent Natalie Brand live for us at the White House this morning Natalie [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=30.96s)]
*  Good morning to you a third presidential term is just not constitutional. So what does mr. Trump mean here? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=36.1s)]
*  Yeah, good morning to you. Errol the 22nd amendment states quite clearly that was added to the Constitution in 1951 [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=42.84s)]
*  It says no person shall serve more than two terms in the office of president [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=50.58s)]
*  These comments were made by President Trump during a phone interview with NBC News and Kristen Welker when he said that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  He is thinking about this, but he would not Errol really elaborate on the methods [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=65.28s)]
*  Welker at one point said well could one possible scenario be that vice president JD Vance runs and then essentially [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=71.16s)]
*  Passes the baton if he were to win and Trump said, you know, that's one way but there's other ways [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=77.8s)]
*  But again, he would not give details [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=84.2s)]
*  but again [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=86.36s)]
*  This is not constitutional and as far as that scenario that I just mentioned the 12th amendment states that if you are [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  Ineligible to serve as a vice president then you can't be president either as you just played there Errol though [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=94.72s)]
*  The president did upon returning to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=101.0s)]
*  DC yesterday. He said, you know, this is still a long ways off and that his focus right now is on this term and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  Separately Natalie the president Trump says this will be a big week for his tariffs. What can we expect? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=113.24s)]
*  Yeah, well the president for weeks has been calling April 2nd liberation day [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  This is the day when those sweeping [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=126.6s)]
*  Reciprocal tariffs are set to take effect now [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=129.56s)]
*  We still don't have exact details about how this will work how many countries it will impact [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=132.78s)]
*  But the president has said that all countries who charge a fee or impose a duty on US exports [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=139.6s)]
*  Can expect a reciprocal or a tariff of equal proportion [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=147.56s)]
*  Now at the same time the president has said in comments over the weekend that the US will be way more generous than [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=153.6s)]
*  Other countries have been over the decades [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=161.44s)]
*  But again, you know it remains to be seen exactly how this will work [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=164.68s)]
*  There is a lot of anticipation and anxiety about these tariffs [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=169.6s)]
*  Especially since the president as you know last week announced 25 percent tariffs on foreign autos [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=173.84s)]
*  And auto parts that's causing a lot of consumers to panic now about buying a car [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=181.28s)]
*  the administration maintains that this is all a [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=187.28s)]
*  Strategy to bring more manufacturing back to the United States more jobs back to the US but understandably [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=191.2s)]
*  Consumers business owners are nervous and in fact, Errol we have new CBS news [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=198.32s)]
*  Polling that shows most of those surveyed believe that the president is focusing too much on tariffs [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=204.0s)]
*  Not enough on lowering prices, which is was a key election [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=210.28s)]
*  Issue as you remember [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=216.04s)]
*  72% according to this poll believe that tariffs will increase prices at least in the short term [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=218.72s)]
*  Yeah, really interesting findings that Natalie thank you so much for tingle that up for us [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxmgm1tbHKE&t=224.96s)]
