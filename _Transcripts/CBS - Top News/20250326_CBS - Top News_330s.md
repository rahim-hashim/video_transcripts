# Judge bashed by Trump in deportation flights case to handle Signal chat lawsuit
**CBS - Top News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4)
*  President Trump has been slamming the justice, the judge rather, assigned to the legal battle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=0.0s)]
*  over deportation flights. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=4.96s)]
*  U.S. District Judge James Boasberg has been pushing back against the use of a wartime [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=11.6s)]
*  Now it turns out Judge Boasberg has actually been assigned to another high profile case, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=14.92s)]
*  this one surrounding the fallout from the signal messages in the Atlantic article, which [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=20.16s)]
*  we've been talking about all day, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=24.16s)]
*  Let's bring in CBS News Department of Justice reporter Jake Rosen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=25.92s)]
*  Jake, good to see you today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=29.2s)]
*  This is quite a twist here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=30.44s)]
*  The first time I heard this, I thought, oh my goodness, this poor guy, another case, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=31.66s)]
*  and he's been getting death threats and a bunch of accusations from the Trump administration. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=36.08s)]
*  So what was your reaction to this? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=39.92s)]
*  The same as yours. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=43.14s)]
*  And Judge Boasberg, who still is in the middle of this legal argument until we get some kind [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  of circuit court decision, potentially either getting rid of the temporary restraining order [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  that Judge Boasberg put on the deportation of these alleged Trinidad and Aragon gang members, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  or it's very well possible that they would allow Judge Boasberg to continue the road [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=60.68s)]
*  that he's on, which is to find more answers from the government, especially in what steps [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=64.92s)]
*  they are taking to give rights and due process to these people who have been deported and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=69.6s)]
*  who would be deported if the order were lifted. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=74.52s)]
*  Judge Boasberg was assigned to a case, and again, this selection process is random, he [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=77.2s)]
*  was assigned to a case in American Oversight versus Hegseth, which is a new lawsuit by [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=81.48s)]
*  a left-leaning watchdog group that has sued the Trump administration, including Secretary [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  of Defense Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, over this Signalgate issue, claiming [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=92.48s)]
*  that there's a violation of the Federal Records Act and that because some of the messages [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=97.64s)]
*  in that chat based on the Atlantic's reporting were set to self-destruct after a certain [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  number of days, that the administration, because they were having these official conversations [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=107.0s)]
*  that were not on classified servers, that there is a violation and a destruction of [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=111.52s)]
*  real government documents. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=116.36s)]
*  This group claims that the Trump administration is in violation of that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=118.6s)]
*  We'll see what comes out of it, but certainly just another high-profile case down here in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=122.0s)]
*  Washington D.C. under now a high-profile judge who really had kept his name out of the news [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  for a while after those January 6 cases kind of had run through his courtroom and now he's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=133.60000000000002s)]
*  back with two pressing issues. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=137.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm sure that the president will respond to this in short order. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=138.96s)]
*  Oh yeah, definitely. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  Jake, let's go back to the battle over the deportation fly. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=143.12s)]
*  The DOJ has been pushing back against the judge's orders. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  In a court filing, Attorney General Pam Bondi and top DOJ officials argue the removals were [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  legal and safeguarded Americans against members of a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=155.36s)]
*  Jake, the question here is what options does the judge now have? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=161.32s)]
*  Well, after the Department of Justice's filing last night, the plaintiffs in this case, which [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  is the ACLU, have until Friday to counter the government's argument that it did not [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=170.92s)]
*  break Judge Boesberger's order in not turning those two plaintiffs around. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=176.92s)]
*  The ACLU has made no small order of this, basically calling it a rebuke of the judge [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=180.76s)]
*  and illegal. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=185.27999999999997s)]
*  They will likely put all of this into a longer court filing due Friday. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=187.23999999999998s)]
*  From there, Judge Boesberger has a couple of options, but the most potentially important [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=191.28s)]
*  and significant of this would be to motion and to move to find the government in contempt [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=195.2s)]
*  of his order. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  But without, as we saw on Monday night, without any details on these flights of who was on [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=203.2s)]
*  them specifically, what time did the planes take off, when were the migrants and alleged [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=209.84s)]
*  gang members loaded on, the big chunk of that timeline is missing. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=214.16s)]
*  Judge Boesberger pledged in court on Friday to get to the bottom of that, so he's got [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=218.16s)]
*  a couple of different paths to go down. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=222.76s)]
*  But until the Circuit Court rules, Judge Boesberger is going to continue asking the government [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=224.44s)]
*  and the ACLU for more information, including just, quite frankly, how many people is the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=229.12s)]
*  ACLU representing in this case? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=233.92s)]
*  They said they actually didn't know how many and where all of the potential people they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=235.76s)]
*  are representing in blocking these deportations are located. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=242.64s)]
*  In line with deportations here, we've learned a Tufts University grad student is the latest [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  to be taken into custody by ICE. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  What do we know about this case? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=251.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  We know that she was here on an international student visa and that she was, according to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  social media footage that our team and this woman's attorney have verified, that there [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=258.8s)]
*  was a confrontation as she was walking on the phone. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=264.08s)]
*  Some agents from Homeland Security or another federal law enforcement group went up to her [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=267.64s)]
*  and arrested her. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  This is very similar to all the cases that we've seen around the country, both in Columbia [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  University at Tufts. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  This student had signed an op-ed in the student newspaper calling for Tufts University to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=279.6s)]
*  acknowledge that there's a genocide going on in Gaza by the Israeli government. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=286.16s)]
*  And she had been part of an online group of names, especially students and academics, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=291.0s)]
*  who had spoken out against this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=296.68s)]
*  That it seems like the administration has, at least in some theory, followed that list. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=298.68s)]
*  A judge did block her removal from the state of Massachusetts, but she is still being [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=302.48s)]
*  detained by federal law enforcement. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=306.52s)]
*  And her attorney said they're not exactly sure where she is being held in Massachusetts [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=308.44s)]
*  right now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=312.44s)]
*  So same kind of process where judges have immediately blocked the deportations of many [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=313.44s)]
*  of these individuals and students and fellows at universities, but they are not being released [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=317.6s)]
*  from custody and lawyers have had to fight to get more details about where their clients [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=322.44s)]
*  are even being held. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=325.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=326.72s)]
*  Jake Rosen, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac5_uDTTKv4&t=327.72s)]
