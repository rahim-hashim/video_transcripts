*  Let's bring in CBS News correspondent [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=10.78s)]
*  Chanel call for more on this story. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=12.88s)]
*  Chanel, can you break down this case for us? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so we've been following [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  this story all day Liz and can now [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=19.84s)]
*  confirm that Minnesota Republican [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=22.5s)]
*  State Senator Justin Icorn has resigned. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Now this happened in the wake of some [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=26.44s)]
*  pretty damning allegations coming [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=29.02s)]
*  from federal prosecutors and there [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=30.62s)]
*  was also Liz growing pressure from [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=32.46s)]
*  lawmakers really on both sides of the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=34.62s)]
*  aisle here now just to recap for viewers. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=36.88s)]
*  Federal prosecutors say Icorn began [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=39.46s)]
*  messaging someone who he thought was [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=41.7s)]
*  17 years old on March 11th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=44.18s)]
*  As it turned out, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=46.14s)]
*  he was actually communicating [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  with an undercover officer. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=49.14s)]
*  Now during those conversations, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=50.78s)]
*  an undercover officer had multiple [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=52.46s)]
*  times said this purported girl [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=54.42s)]
*  was 17 years old. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=56.5s)]
*  Despite that, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=57.82s)]
*  this conversation continued and Icorn [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=58.660000000000004s)]
*  allegedly asked for several photos. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=60.58s)]
*  How did this happen? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=62.58s)]
*  Will prosecutors say Icorn [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=64.18s)]
*  answered an online ad that was [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=65.78s)]
*  part of a bigger and broader operation [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=68.02s)]
*  that targets sex trafficking on Monday. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=70.7s)]
*  Authorities say that he was supposed [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=73.06s)]
*  to meet up with that alleged teenager, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=75.14s)]
*  and that's when he was charged with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=77.82s)]
*  attempted coercion or enticement of a minor. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=80.34s)]
*  On Tuesday, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=82.86s)]
*  Liz he was booked into jail and he's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  now being held there without bail. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=86.46s)]
*  But of course that is what fueled [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=88.38s)]
*  this fallout in the state capital. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=90.42s)]
*  Last night we heard from Senate [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=92.3s)]
*  GOP leader Mark Johnson and he [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=94.16s)]
*  had said that look, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=96.14s)]
*  we're not going to wait for Icorn [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  to resign instead I'm going to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=99.22s)]
*  be putting forth a motion to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=101.1s)]
*  remove him before that happens. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=102.86s)]
*  Now that session was slated to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=104.46s)]
*  kick off at noon today, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=106.14s)]
*  but before that happened, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  just a few minutes before that happened, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=108.78s)]
*  we got word into our newsroom [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=110.82s)]
*  that Icorn had resigned. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=112.62s)]
*  And she now you're keeping [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=113.9s)]
*  with another big story. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=115.22s)]
*  The Taliban releasing a Delta [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=116.5s)]
*  Airlines mechanic who was detained [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  by Taliban authorities for more [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=119.92s)]
*  than two years. What are the details? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=121.66s)]
*  What are the details in this story? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=123.78s)]
*  Right, so Liz, the State Department [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=126.74s)]
*  is saying George Glassman, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=128.54s)]
*  who was held by the Taliban for [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=129.78s)]
*  more than two years, has now been released. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=131.78s)]
*  This is someone who the government [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=134.18s)]
*  says was abducted by the Taliban [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=136.02s)]
*  back in December of 2022. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=137.9s)]
*  He was there as a tourist visiting [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=139.3s)]
*  the country and was just released [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=141.3s)]
*  today as a result of this new deal [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=143.18s)]
*  brokered by the US and Qatar. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=145.70000000000002s)]
*  Glassman is now we should mention [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=147.58s)]
*  the third American detainee to be [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  released by the Taliban since January, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=151.74s)]
*  and Secretary of State Marco Rubio [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=153.9s)]
*  put out a statement this morning. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=156.06s)]
*  I'll read you part of it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=158.22s)]
*  It says George joins Americans. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=160.3s)]
*  Ryan Corbett and William McEntee, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  who were released from Afghanistan on [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=164.02s)]
*  the night of President Trump's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  inauguration and then returned [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=167.98000000000002s)]
*  home to their families. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=169.5s)]
*  It goes on to say George is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=170.94s)]
*  released is a positive and constructive step. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=172.98s)]
*  It's also a reminder that other [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=175.94s)]
*  Americans are still detained in Afghanistan, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=178.06s)]
*  and President Trump will continue [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=180.66s)]
*  his tireless work to free all [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=182.62s)]
*  Americans unjustly detained around the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  Now important to note as well that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=187.54s)]
*  the last two Americans who we just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=190.14s)]
*  mentioned those detainees who were [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=192.82s)]
*  released earlier this year that had [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=194.98s)]
*  happened during the Biden administration. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=197.62s)]
*  That negotiation I should say, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=200.1s)]
*  also involved an exchange for [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=202.26s)]
*  someone named Khan Mohammed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=204.02s)]
*  This is someone who was sentenced [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=205.66s)]
*  to two life terms after being [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=207.98s)]
*  convicted under US narco terrorism laws. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=210.28s)]
*  And so I'm saying that to explain [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=212.66s)]
*  that George Glassman, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=215.1s)]
*  who was just released today in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=216.34s)]
*  this particular deal, the US did [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=218.62s)]
*  not have to give up a prisoner. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=220.74s)]
*  So that's important to note because [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=223.18s)]
*  state officials are saying this was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=225.26s)]
*  seen as sort of a goodwill gesture [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=227.54s)]
*  as the Taliban is now trying to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=229.78s)]
*  get the negotiations between [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=232.22s)]
*  the US and Afghanistan. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=233.58s)]
*  Alright, CBS News correspondent [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=235.78s)]
*  Chanel Call. Thank you so much for that update. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHw4GLQb6_I&t=236.9s)]
