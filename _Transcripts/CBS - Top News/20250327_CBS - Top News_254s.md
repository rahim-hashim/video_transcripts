# Ford, General Motors stocks fall after Trump's tariff on imported cars
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA)
*  We're watching Wall Street where the closing bell rang just moments ago as investors react to President Donald Trump's new [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=0.0s)]
*  25% tariffs on auto imports so the Dow landing in the red Ford fell more than 3% [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=6.76s)]
*  General Motors fell more than 6% [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=13.16s)]
*  So let's take a look at our interactive stock market heat map. This is brought to us by FinViz [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=16.04s)]
*  So it shows the top 500 stocks all of this right now is in real time [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=22.2s)]
*  So the red obviously indicating the stock is down green means it is up and the size of the box that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=26.24s)]
*  represents the market cap [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=32.08s)]
*  so the 25 percent auto tariffs target imported cars including [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=33.6s)]
*  Passenger vehicles and light trucks as well as imported parts including engines [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=38.72s)]
*  Transmissions powertrain parts and electrical components and keep in mind [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=43.84s)]
*  One vehicle component may cross the US Mexico and US [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Canada borders up to eight times before reaching final assembly according to e marketer [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=52.56s)]
*  All right, that's something new. I just learned there. So let's bring in CBS News money watch correspondent Kelly [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=59.2s)]
*  Oh Grady, so Kelly if I'm in the market to buy a car, I'm sure this is a question people always ask [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=64.36s)]
*  Do you buy it now or do you wait? What do we do? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=69.88s)]
*  So potentially I I've never someone that says go out and panic buy because I feel like you never get a good deal [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=74.4s)]
*  If you're coming to the table with that mentality, but look this goes into effect April 2nd [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=80.36s)]
*  So that's Wednesday of next week [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=86.36s)]
*  And then the revenue the tariffs start to get collected the very next day April 3rd [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=87.63999999999999s)]
*  And so the big question is when you go to the lot to buy a new car [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=92.6s)]
*  How much of that 25 percent tariff if that car is made outside the US is going to get passed on to you the consumer? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=97.24s)]
*  And so in fact, I recently went to a local dealership [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=105.32s)]
*  I asked that very question to the owner take a listen to what he had to say [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=108.24s)]
*  I think the manufacturer has no choice but to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  Pass that along to the consumer because they need to drive profits [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=116.24s)]
*  How quickly does that get passed on to the consumer? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=119.56s)]
*  Anything that is has not been shipped yet or is at the dock that's getting shipped into these ports [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  That's ultimately going into a vehicle to be manufactured. It's immediate [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=127.36s)]
*  So to to sort of caveats that I want to put around that so he said it's going to be immediate now the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=132.04s)]
*  average inventory [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=137.8s)]
*  So basically, you know, we're not talking about the things that haven't shipped yet [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=139.08s)]
*  It's already on the lot the average inventory for a dealer is about 60 days. So about two months [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=142.24s)]
*  You're probably not going to see the price go up until that point [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=146.68s)]
*  The second thing is that for cars that are coming in from Mexico and Canada and they're protected under that very important trade deal between [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=150.36s)]
*  Mexico Canada and the US it's called USMCA [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=158.68s)]
*  The tariffs are delayed [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=161.64s)]
*  We don't have a time on the calendar because the White House is trying to figure out [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=163.4s)]
*  How how they're gonna assess how much of a particular car is made in the US and they're only gonna tariff the part [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=168.20000000000002s)]
*  That is not made in the US. They don't know how they're gonna assess that right now [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=174.94s)]
*  So they basically said look we're gonna hold off on those cars [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=178.52s)]
*  So all to say look, I think there's some urgency if you are already in the market [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=181.72s)]
*  But there's a little bit of wiggle room until you're gonna see the price increase [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=187.08s)]
*  Okay, so Kelly when we look at the three big automakers on Wall Street, why is General Motors getting hit the hardest? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=189.92s)]
*  Because they have the most exposure [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=198.56s)]
*  Particularly to making their cars in Mexico [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=201.28s)]
*  So Ford for example, they make nearly 80% of their vehicles that they sell in the US in the US [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=203.56s)]
*  versus GM only makes about 52% and Stellantis [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Which is one of the other big three makes more than that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=215.54s)]
*  And so that's why you're seeing the stock get hit more because investors are saying [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=217.98s)]
*  Oh, well the parts that you're bringing in from these other countries the cars that you're bringing in that are already assembled in these other [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=222.22s)]
*  countries you have more inventory that's going to be impacted by these tariffs and I contrast that to what you see happening to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=228.54s)]
*  Tesla and Rivian those are two other stocks two other car companies [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  Were basically a hundred percent or near hundred percent when you look at the parts coming in are made in the US [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=240.42s)]
*  Both of those stocks were up. So basically the exact opposite of GM Jules great information as always Kelly. Thank you so much [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7UTbkzvJSA&t=246.7s)]
