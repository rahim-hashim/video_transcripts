# Trump asks Stefanik to withdraw from United Nations ambassador nomination
**CBS - Top News:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0)
*  We begin with some breaking news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=0.0s)]
*  The White House has officially asked Representative Elise Stefanik to withdraw her name as President [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=2.4s)]
*  Trump's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=6.76s)]
*  President Trump confirmed the reports, taking to Truth Social to say in part, quote, as [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=10.72s)]
*  we advance our America First agenda, it is essential that we maintain every Republican [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=14.8s)]
*  seat in Congress. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=19.36s)]
*  He added, I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest allies, to remain in Congress. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=21.04s)]
*  The Republican representative from New York has been a loyal advocate for President Trump, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=27.0s)]
*  which has quickly propelled her within the party. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  But Republicans currently hold a slim majority in the House. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=33.04s)]
*  With four seat vacancies, losing Stefanik could pose legislative hurdles for the party's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  agenda. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=41.160000000000004s)]
*  The White House is also continuing to deal with a fallout from the nearly full release [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=42.32s)]
*  of a signal chat's logs, which included top intelligence officials and the editor-in-chief [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  at The Atlantic, inadvertently. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=52.08s)]
*  Later this afternoon, the Trump administration is heading to court over the controversy. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=54.4s)]
*  The same judge issued a temporary block against the White House using a wartime act to deport [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=58.8s)]
*  Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador is now presiding over this lawsuit over Trump officials [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=63.92s)]
*  using signal to discuss sensitive plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=70.2s)]
*  Those cases, by the way, are assigned randomly among the 20 judges in the district. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=74.52s)]
*  The Trump administration has repeatedly downplayed the details of the chat, saying none of the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=79.0s)]
*  information discussed was classified. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=83.36s)]
*  Let's turn now to CBS News Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=86.08s)]
*  Ed, what more can you tell us about the decision for Elise Stefanik to pull her nomination? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=89.16s)]
*  It does appear, at least officially, publicly, Lindsay, that this has everything to do with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=93.48s)]
*  the tight margins in the House. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=97.08s)]
*  The president's saying in part that with a very tight majority, I don't want to take [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=98.6s)]
*  a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=103.48s)]
*  The people love Elise, and with her we have nothing to worry about come Election Day. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=106.2s)]
*  She represents a ruby red Republican district that stretches across much of northern New [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=109.64s)]
*  York, the Adirondacks, and there was the possibility that the governor, the Democratic governor [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=115.04s)]
*  of New York, would call a special election at a time that maybe benefited Democratic [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=120.28s)]
*  turnout. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=125.08s)]
*  And so with the margin being as close as it is, right now it's five seats come Tuesday [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=126.08s)]
*  when two Republicans are expected to win special elections in Florida for the vacancies created [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=132.4s)]
*  by Mike Walz and Matt Gaetz. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=136.56s)]
*  That would expand a little bit, but then you've got all this controversial tax and spending [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=139.52s)]
*  legislation coming in the next several weeks or months where there are going to be a handful [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=143.04s)]
*  of Republicans that want to or expect to vote no. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=147.48s)]
*  And so by keeping as many Republican yes votes potentially, at least supportive of leadership [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=150.4s)]
*  in the White House, in the House, the hope is that the agenda can get through. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=154.12s)]
*  Not great for Stefanik, who had been spending much of the last several weeks preparing to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=157.84s)]
*  Congress, sending her constituents notes, recapping her career, posting a lot of photos [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=162.66s)]
*  that sort of mention the highlights of her congressional tenure. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=167.66s)]
*  But now by being asked to stay, she's doing the president a solid by doing so. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=171.98s)]
*  It is unclear who might be the replacement nominee, but clearly it'll have to be someone [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=178.28s)]
*  who doesn't serve currently in Congress. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=184.22s)]
*  The president went to Congress to get a few people into his administration. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=186.46s)]
*  Matt Gaetz was obviously one that was being talked about. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=190.82s)]
*  Of course, his nomination was withdrawn. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=192.98s)]
*  Mike Walz, who's now the national security adviser. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=194.98s)]
*  Stefanik was another. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  There are a handful of former representatives that are now serving in cabinet or in other [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  senior government positions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=205.85999999999999s)]
*  But he's going to have to find somebody else, and we'll wait and see who that might be. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=207.78s)]
*  And the Trump administration continues to downplay the now infamous Signal Group chat. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=211.62s)]
*  What more can you tell us about the hearing scheduled for this afternoon? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=215.22s)]
*  So 4 p.m. Eastern, the same judge, as you mentioned, that's handling the legal fight [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=218.9s)]
*  over the use of the Alien Enemies Act is now also assigned to this case as they are randomly [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=222.9s)]
*  assigned. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=226.78s)]
*  And it's an independent, nonpartisan watchdog group that's essentially suing most of the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=227.9s)]
*  people in the group chat for violating the Espionage Act and potentially sharing classified [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=231.62s)]
*  information in an unauthorized way. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=237.94s)]
*  Among other things, they're being ordered or they're expected to be ordered to preserve [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=239.9s)]
*  all of the text messages or at least screen grabs of them as potential evidence and to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=244.02s)]
*  be filed away as part of the Presidential Records Act. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=249.42s)]
*  It was perhaps no surprise that somebody was going to sue over this, in part because a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=253.02s)]
*  lot of these groups understand if the Republican-led Congress isn't going to do it, if a Department [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=257.34s)]
*  of Justice that is more closely aligned with the president than any other in modern history [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=263.3s)]
*  is essentially taking cues on who to prosecute and when from the president himself, they're [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=267.82s)]
*  not going to do it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=272.18s)]
*  Somebody has to sue to try to at least hold somebody to account. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=273.58s)]
*  And so that's what's expected to begin unfolding today in court. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=276.62s)]
*  Already our Melissa Quinn has noted that in a early filing from the government, the Treasury [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=280.18s)]
*  Department at least had already taken steps to preserve the messages, taking them from [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=285.62s)]
*  the Treasury Secretary's phone and making sure that they've been saved in a way that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=289.34s)]
*  they could be preserved as part of the Presidential Records Act. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=293.41999999999996s)]
*  Alright, Ed O'Keefe, thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDpRaBOBVm0&t=297.26s)]
