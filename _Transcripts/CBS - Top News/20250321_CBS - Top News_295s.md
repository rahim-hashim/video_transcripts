# Trump announces F-47 fighter jet as details emerge about China's defense efforts
**CBS - Top News:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co)
*  President Trump announced that Boeing is receiving a $20 billion Air Force contract to create [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=0.0s)]
*  the nation's next generation fleet of military aircraft. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=5.28s)]
*  The plane, known as the F-47, will be built over the next several years with production [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=8.92s)]
*  already underway. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=12.76s)]
*  Here is a rendering of what it will look like. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=14.18s)]
*  The F-47 will be the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=16.72s)]
*  An experimental version of the plane has secretly been flying for almost five years, and we're [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=23.32s)]
*  confident that it massively overpowers the capabilities of any other nation. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=28.88s)]
*  There's no other nation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=34.2s)]
*  We know every other plane. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=35.2s)]
*  I've seen every one of them. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=36.36s)]
*  And it's not even close. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=38.48s)]
*  This is a next level. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=39.48s)]
*  Before the announcement, Elon Musk and Defense Secretary Pete Hegsith met at the Pentagon. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=41.96s)]
*  Musk's visit became a point of contention after reports that it would include a briefing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  about the military's plans for a potential war with China. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=49.96s)]
*  Now, those reports were quickly dismissed by both Musk and the Trump administration. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=53.879999999999995s)]
*  CBS News Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe joins us now for [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=58.6s)]
*  more on this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=61.84s)]
*  Ed, what else can you tell us about today's announcement about this new fleet of military [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=62.84s)]
*  aircraft? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=66.16s)]
*  Well, Lindsay, it's important to point out that this announcement from the United States [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=67.16s)]
*  comes as there have been reports, a lot of social media chatter, and some images seen [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=70.56s)]
*  of what's purported to be China's work on its sixth generation or next generation aircraft. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=75.92s)]
*  And so this announcement comes in the wake of those revelations that China may already [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=82.62s)]
*  be flying models of their version of this aircraft that will become usable in the next [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=87.54s)]
*  few years. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=93.54s)]
*  The F-47, named aptly for the current 47th president, is still several years away. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=94.54s)]
*  But this multi-billion dollar contract awarded to Boeing now publicly acknowledges what's [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=100.98s)]
*  already been underway for some time at the Pentagon, and that is planning for this next [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=106.5s)]
*  generation aircraft. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=110.22s)]
*  Next generation, the sense of the size and scope of the engine, the computing that can [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=111.22s)]
*  be done, the stealth capabilities, whether or not it will work alongside drones or not. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=114.86s)]
*  You heard Air Force officials who were in the Oval Office with the president talk about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=119.82s)]
*  the long-range capabilities of it, the fact that it can deploy faster and possibly take [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=122.98s)]
*  care of some military operations without the need to deploy troops. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=128.3s)]
*  That's all sort of in forward future thinking war planning that's been underway for several [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=131.16s)]
*  years. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=136.14s)]
*  And that the United States, the military, Congress, at least those that track defense [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=137.14s)]
*  is well behind on when it comes to its biggest adversary, China. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=141.5s)]
*  And Elon Musk was invited by Secretary Hegset to the Department of Defense today. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=146.3s)]
*  There have been conflicting reports about the purpose of the visit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=149.82s)]
*  Why was he there? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=152.02s)]
*  Well, there's still conflict, and let's put it that way. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=153.5s)]
*  That you saw reports last night for the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal saying [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=156.42s)]
*  that it was specifically to cover advanced war planning for China, as the Pentagon does [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=160.34s)]
*  all the time, war planning, scenario planning of all sorts. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=166.42000000000002s)]
*  But to discuss China specifically, that you saw administration officials, including Secretary [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=170.1s)]
*  Hegset and the president, quickly suggest otherwise is perhaps a signal that maybe that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=174.42s)]
*  was indeed part of the plan. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=178.9s)]
*  Was it ultimately? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=180.38s)]
*  Not clear. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=181.7s)]
*  Hegset and Musk alluded to it being partly about the ongoing work of the Department of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=182.7s)]
*  Government efficiency and Musk's desire to better understand some of the Pentagon's planning. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=187.38s)]
*  He was only there about 80 minutes or so and pointed out correctly that he has been there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=191.94s)]
*  plenty of other times because he is a defense contractor by way of SpaceX and Starlink and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=196.9s)]
*  his other projects. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=201.98000000000002s)]
*  So he's no stranger to the building. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=202.98000000000002s)]
*  The concern, of course, is that somebody who is an unelected senior government official [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=204.94000000000003s)]
*  working at the behest of the president may have been read into some incredibly top secret [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=209.74s)]
*  or classified information this morning. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=214.22000000000003s)]
*  And that may have been part of why sources were eager to get that information out before [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=216.74s)]
*  the meeting to let it be known that that was at least the initial plan. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=220.94000000000003s)]
*  Hard to say ultimately what was discussed at least at this hour, but it was notable [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=225.1s)]
*  how quickly the administration stepped out to suggest it was not, as originally reported, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=229.94s)]
*  just about China. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=234.42000000000002s)]
*  One of the busiest phrases from the president's first administration, a travel ban in the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  news again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=239.98s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=240.98s)]
*  So we're waiting for some kind of an announcement of countries from which people would be banned [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=242.74s)]
*  from entering the United States, a list of a handful, about a dozen or so red countries [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=247.82s)]
*  from which they would not be allowed. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=252.78s)]
*  Afghanistan, notably, was on one reported draft of those countries. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=254.22s)]
*  We are, it is unclear whether that is coming today as initially expected or whether there [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  may be a few more days before final information is given out. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=263.3s)]
*  But you're right, this would in essence revive a Trump 1.0 policy of banning travelers from [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=267.53999999999996s)]
*  certain countries deemed too dangerous or perhaps home to terrorist organizations or [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=273.18s)]
*  other dangerous entities. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=278.64s)]
*  And if they're not necessarily from a country that's outright banned, there might be additional [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=281.46s)]
*  or much more rigorous screening of people who are trying to get into the United States [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  for whatever reason. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=288.82s)]
*  And we'll wait and see whether that comes today or early next week. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=290.41999999999996s)]
*  Ed, okay, thank you so much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKF_ObR4Co&t=293.21999999999997s)]
