# Wehrey on National Guards in Arab States
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 14, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM)
*  One of the long-term consequences of the Arab Spring has been the breakdown of conventional [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=0.0s)]
*  armies in a number of Arab states, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Syria. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=14.3s)]
*  So what we're really seeing is the rise of militias, militias that are tied to ethnic [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=21.48s)]
*  or tribal or communal groups, while militaries that have been tied to the state have broken [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=27.16s)]
*  down or collapsed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=32.6s)]
*  And this presents a quandary for governments in the region and also for the United States. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=34.76s)]
*  How do you reconstruct militaries in these countries? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=40.16s)]
*  Especially when you've got terrorist threats brewing from the Islamic State, al-Qaeda. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  In many cases, these militias are well positioned to go after those threats. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=49.6s)]
*  In at least two states in the region, there have been these projects to create what's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=54.56s)]
*  called national guards, meaning you take these local or provincial or tribal militias and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=58.2s)]
*  you sort of fold them under a national command structure. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  You try to formalize them. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=68.84s)]
*  You try to regularize them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=70.08s)]
*  In both cases, these projects have failed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=72.30000000000001s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that they're not without value. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=75.84s)]
*  What we have to look at is how did the states go about implementing these national guard [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  programs? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=83.88s)]
*  And what we find is that in many cases, they didn't take into account certain political [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=85.88s)]
*  realities, namely that the old military institutions, the old officer class, opposed these initiatives. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  They saw the militias and the national guard as a challenge to their authority. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=97.08s)]
*  So a key conclusion from this is that building national guards or attempting to integrate [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=101.6s)]
*  militias into this larger structure has to be accompanied by broader political reconciliation [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=106.72s)]
*  and also security sector reforms. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=113.48s)]
*  I think what we're seeing in a number of Arab states post Arab Spring is that the old social [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=115.92s)]
*  compact or the old ruling bargain, which was heavily centralized, in other words, power [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=122.32s)]
*  was concentrated in the capital, that's broken down. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=126.62s)]
*  And so we're looking at a number of federal arrangements where power is being dispersed [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=129.48s)]
*  down to the local level, to the provincial level. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=135.72s)]
*  And that means that security is being handled by local actors. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=138.76s)]
*  So in that sense, I think the national guard strategy can be a pressure release. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=141.84s)]
*  It can sort of push power down to the local level. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=146.48s)]
*  It can aid in federal arrangements if states decide to go down that route. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=148.8s)]
*  But again, the key thing is it has to be accompanied by a political track. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=153.68s)]
*  I mean, you can't just say we're going to push the security down to the local level. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=157.24s)]
*  You need constitutional arrangements that formalize this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=161.96s)]
*  You need to have some sort of overarching command authority. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=165.23999999999998s)]
*  But I think the national guards can be a useful corrective to past practices that have been [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=169.07999999999998s)]
*  overly centralized where power was concentrated in the hands of just a few. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRyLEVvcObM&t=174.95999999999998s)]
