# Salem on Iraq's Foreign Relations
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [December 20, 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo)
*  What is the impact of the economic crisis on Iraq? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=0.0s)]
*  Iraq's foreign interests are driven a lot by its economic and its security interests. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=10.0s)]
*  Its economy is one of the, well it's the sixth largest in the region, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=15.0s)]
*  it's one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it's around 118 billion. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=20.0s)]
*  And the political decision makers in Iraq are very closely intertwined with economic interests. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=24.0s)]
*  The main sector is oil and gas, they have major contracts with the US, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=29.0s)]
*  West and China, Chinese companies, their oil export routes force them to try to get oil exports [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=34.0s)]
*  through the Straits of Hormuz East and through Turkey, Syria and Jordan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=40.0s)]
*  So they need good relations both internationally and good relations in the region. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=44.0s)]
*  Their defense contracting, most of it is with the US, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=48.0s)]
*  but they also have significant contracts with Russia, Czech Republic and South Korea. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=52.0s)]
*  So there too they have a plethora of interests. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=56.0s)]
*  So I would say Iraq, despite its internal divisions and differences over sectarianism, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=59.0s)]
*  over power sharing and over Kinkouk and over Syria, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=65.0s)]
*  in terms of its economic and foreign interests, whether it's economics, defense or water or electricity, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=68.0s)]
*  those drivers push Iraq to remain somewhat centrist in its foreign policy. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=73.0s)]
*  Until the Iraqis can consolidate their internal issues, they will not have a unified foreign policy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=79.0s)]
*  And until Iraq has a unified foreign policy, it will not be able to capitalize on its great potential [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=87.0s)]
*  to be a major player in the region, to build on its economic and security interests for the Iraqi people [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=93.0s)]
*  and I would say for the prosperity of the region. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=99.0s)]
*  For the regional and international players, I think it's important to understand the complexity [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=102.0s)]
*  of Iraqi interests, to be reassured that Iraq's economic and security interests [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=108.0s)]
*  are not pushing Iraq to align with one axis against another. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=113.0s)]
*  Unlike Iran, unlike Saudi Arabia, Iraq cannot afford to be simply on one side. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=121.0s)]
*  The US should continue to be very much engaged with Iraq, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=127.0s)]
*  should encourage the Iraqis as the Obama administration has done to resolve their internal differences, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=130.0s)]
*  but can build on cooperation between the two militaries, on combating al-Qaeda [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=136.0s)]
*  and on continuing to build the Iraqi oil and gas sector. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=141.0s)]
*  The US has investments there, US companies, but there's also Chinese and others. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=146.0s)]
*  And if Iraq succeeds, that is a case where regional international cooperation in this growing economy [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=151.0s)]
*  will create more sort of common interests and more synergies. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YfTMdTjMLo&t=157.0s)]
