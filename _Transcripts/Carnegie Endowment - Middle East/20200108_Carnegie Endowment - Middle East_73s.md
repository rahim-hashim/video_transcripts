# Will Iran continue to retaliate?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs)
*  I think the rocket attack last night was just the opening salvo for Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=0.0s)]
*  The assassination of Qassem Soleimani was a truly momentous earthquake for Iranian politics. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=5.68s)]
*  And I think their retaliation against not only the United States, but U.S. allies is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=12.88s)]
*  likely going to be sustained retaliation for many months to come. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=18.68s)]
*  Given the unprecedented nature of Soleimani's assassination, I think we also need to think [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=25.04s)]
*  outside the box. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=31.56s)]
*  There may be unprecedented nature of Iranian retaliations, things that they haven't done [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=32.76s)]
*  before, like going after either current or former U.S. officials. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=38.56s)]
*  Now, Iran has to be mindful not to cross American red lines. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=43.76s)]
*  They don't want to start a war with the United States. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=48.44s)]
*  But I think Iran will also try to put Donald Trump in a bind in 2020 because they also [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=52.16s)]
*  know that Trump doesn't want conflict. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=58.959999999999994s)]
*  Conflict would be bad for his reelection. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  And so I think Iran is going to be probably the largest looming foreign policy issue in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  2020 for President Trump. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq7eyI9xuzs&t=70.32s)]
