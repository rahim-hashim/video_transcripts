# North Africa: Tension as the New Normal?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [December 16, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU)
*  Welcome to this panel on the politics of North Africa. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=60.0s)]
*  I'm Yazeed Zahir. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=67.0s)]
*  I'm a senior fellow at the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=68.0s)]
*  And with me today, I have a powerful panel of colleagues, including Michelle Dunn, head [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=74.44s)]
*  of the Middle East program of Carnegie in Washington, D.C., Frederick Weary, senior [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  fellow, also based in D.C., resident scholar Dalia Ghanem, based in Beirut, and Hamza Maddib, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=88.86s)]
*  non-resident scholar based in Tunisia. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=96.18s)]
*  We're going to be discussing the tumultuous year that has just passed in North Africa, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=99.14s)]
*  where we've got a persisting conflict in Libya that has actually intensified, protests in [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=105.42s)]
*  Algeria, tug of war between Egypt and Ethiopia, recent tensions in the Western Sahara, any [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=110.42s)]
*  of which might threaten the region's stability. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=116.86s)]
*  The panelists will discuss the implications of these unfolding dynamics and discuss the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=120.17999999999999s)]
*  future of the region's ruling political orders, geopolitical rivalries, as well as the alliances [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=125.22s)]
*  that they expect will shape North Africa in 2021. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=131.9s)]
*  I'm going to turn immediately to Fred Weary to discuss Libya. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=136.74s)]
*  It's very clear, it's been made more clear than ever before, that Libya has become an [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  important focal point of regional and international rivalries. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=147.82s)]
*  And I'm going to go straight to a very simple question, which is what is the current state [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=153.5s)]
*  of play on the ground? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Eugene. You know, there's some cause for both optimism and pessimism, some remarkable [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=161.38s)]
*  developments over the summer and fall of this year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=167.1s)]
*  Briefly stated, there was a massive offensive by the government of National Accord, backed [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=170.62s)]
*  by Turkey, that pushed Heftar's forces to the oil crescent region. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=176.38s)]
*  There's a stalemate. There was a truce signed by the two sides in October. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=182.22s)]
*  The oil blockade has been lifted. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=188.42s)]
*  You've had some positive steps, some positive momentum with the talks that are ongoing, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  brokered by the United Nations, specifically on economic reform. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  And just yesterday, the rival branches of the central bank met for the first time in [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=202.1s)]
*  five years and they agreed to unify the foreign exchange rate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=208.66s)]
*  That's an important economic reform step that basically reduces the black market [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=212.66s)]
*  incentives. And it shows we've got some momentum in terms of healing institutional [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=219.26000000000002s)]
*  rifts. You've had protests in both the East and the West against government authorities [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=224.86s)]
*  over services and governance. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=230.62s)]
*  And that shows that people power matters. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  Right. That's sort of the good news. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=235.98000000000002s)]
*  The bad news is there's some alarming signs that the ceasefire is not being implemented [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=239.18s)]
*  in that oil crescent region. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  There are military talks underway, but it's unclear if the representatives really have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=246.5s)]
*  clout on the ground. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=251.86s)]
*  You've got elite jockeying. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=254.38s)]
*  You've got vested elite interests. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=256.62s)]
*  There are people in Libya, elites that benefit from the frozen status quo, and they don't [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=258.7s)]
*  want to move the political transition forward. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=262.94s)]
*  You've got the longstanding problem of militias is still very entrenched, especially in [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=267.1s)]
*  Tripoli, militia capture of key government organs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=272.06s)]
*  And then very briefly, I'll close on this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=275.22s)]
*  One of the stipulations of the UN Brokered Agreement was the departure of foreign forces [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=278.02000000000004s)]
*  from Libya. But the opposite has been occurring. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  You've got a massive military buildup. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  There are 10 military bases throughout Libya that are occupied by the foreign forces, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=288.78000000000003s)]
*  foreign countries backing each side. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=294.90000000000003s)]
*  And there's no sign that they're going to leave. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=296.66s)]
*  And that's a huge problem moving forward for Libya's sovereignty. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=298.78000000000003s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=302.38s)]
*  So I had a slightly broader question to put to you about the UN Brokered talks and whether [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=303.38s)]
*  they're progressing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=308.98s)]
*  You sort of said not very well, or at least with an immense danger looming. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=309.98s)]
*  And so I can go straight to the bottom line is, are we looking at renewed armed conflict [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  on a major scale? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=320.9s)]
*  And does that, given who's involved at the moment in terms of regional players and international [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=322.18s)]
*  players, are we looking at a whole new scale of armed conflict? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=327.98s)]
*  This has been the longstanding fear with previous agreements. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=331.7s)]
*  You had the 2015 Morocco agreement and it failed to tackle key issues related to the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=335.62s)]
*  distribution of economic wealth, related to the security sector, the monopolization of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=339.86s)]
*  force. And these questions are still very powerful. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=344.58s)]
*  And so you can see a reconfiguration of the conflict in the region. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=347.78s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=352.18s)]
*  So, you know, you can see a reconfiguration of the conflict. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=354.38000000000005s)]
*  My sense is there's an exhaustion among Libyan actors on the ground with fighting. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=358.18s)]
*  You have the covid pandemic. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=364.94000000000005s)]
*  But foreign backers could be readying for another escalation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  Again, we have to look at the massive numbers of foreign mercenaries on the ground that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=371.74s)]
*  give those foreign powers the ability to wage conflict, whether or not the Libyan proxies [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=377.18s)]
*  actually agree to it. And I think that's very alarming. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=383.58s)]
*  When you look at the numbers of Syrian mercenaries and Wagner mercenaries on both sides, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=386.14s)]
*  you're looking at a hair trigger situation. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=390.94s)]
*  Thanks. Now, I've got a lot to follow up on that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=396.41999999999996s)]
*  And you've started to map out not just what the regional international players are doing, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=401.46s)]
*  but also what's happening on the ground among Libyans and the trends there. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=406.53999999999996s)]
*  I want to come back to that. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=410.09999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to pause for a moment because I'd like to move to Egypt and start also there [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  with asking Michelle about the Sisi administration and how secure it is. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=416.97999999999996s)]
*  I want to start to sort of form a picture of where each of these countries is today [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  before then digging down deeper into some of the geopolitical dynamics, as well as what [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=430.26s)]
*  local actors can or should do to change things. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=435.02s)]
*  And here, of course, in Egypt, we've got an administration that's far more visibly in [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=437.78s)]
*  control, is a single state power. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=442.21999999999997s)]
*  This is a regime, a political regime that has apparently been consolidating itself since [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=445.34s)]
*  2014. Where do you see this, Michelle, today? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=451.73999999999995s)]
*  How secure is the regime? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=456.14s)]
*  How deeply anchored and consolidated is it? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=457.7s)]
*  Well, Yazid, I would describe Egypt right now as having a kind of brittle stability, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=461.22s)]
*  which means that things are very much in a... [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=468.66s)]
*  There's a feeling of stasis, of not much going on. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=473.90000000000003s)]
*  And yet, you know, it could fracture. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=476.86s)]
*  And that's because President Sisi has consolidated his regime in a way that has narrowed his [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=479.90000000000003s)]
*  base over time, over the six years he's been president, seven years he's been in control, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=489.34s)]
*  rather than broadened it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=495.94s)]
*  And we saw that recently with parliamentary elections that were just held in Egypt, that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=498.38s)]
*  formal politics have been narrowed down to a very small group and even lots of parties [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=502.78s)]
*  and individuals who were basically supporters of Sisi, might have tried to have some [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=512.74s)]
*  margin of independence in the past. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=518.3s)]
*  They're just not allowed to participate anymore. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=519.8599999999999s)]
*  The same thing is true in a way of the economy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=524.18s)]
*  You know, Egypt, what Egypt really needs is a much broader economy, economy that really [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=527.8199999999999s)]
*  allows the private sector to generate jobs for its very large and growing population. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=535.02s)]
*  And yet, that's not what we see happening. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=540.9799999999999s)]
*  You know, what we have seen is Sisi favoring the military role in the economy, allowing [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=543.46s)]
*  the military. And Yazeed, you're the expert on this one, you know, to go in and dominate [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=550.18s)]
*  additional sectors of the economy that were once controlled by the private sector. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=556.06s)]
*  And, you know, we see an economic policy that's just based on a few pillars and ones that I [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=562.34s)]
*  think are not very reliable right now. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=569.34s)]
*  You know, we on gas, natural gas, but there's a world glut of gas. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=571.9s)]
*  So, you know, Egypt is having to dance very fast so that it can use more of its gas at [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=579.14s)]
*  home because now the export picture is not looking particularly bright. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=585.42s)]
*  And on tourism, which we know is it will return someday. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=590.94s)]
*  It always does in Egypt, but it's obviously a dark picture for tourism right now with [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=594.98s)]
*  the pandemic and on these construction mega projects such as the new capital. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=599.94s)]
*  You know, these are sort of the the the basis for growth, but they're not very they're [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=606.62s)]
*  not not very vigorous and they're not going to generate jobs and so forth. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  So what that has meant is for many, many Egyptians, the economic picture is a bad one. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=616.58s)]
*  Sisi has taken some very strong austerity measures, which have gotten him the approval [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=622.6600000000001s)]
*  of the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=628.54s)]
*  But he's also become very heavily indebted abroad and [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=634.0999999999999s)]
*  bizarrely gone on a massive arms spending spree over the last five years, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=640.26s)]
*  you know, which has it has political value for him to do that. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=646.78s)]
*  But it's hard to explain in the face of, you know, the very tight [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=651.58s)]
*  situate fiscal situation inside of Egypt and the fact that Egypt at the same time [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=657.58s)]
*  has engaged in in massive borrowing. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=662.1s)]
*  The state has both domestically and internationally. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=664.7s)]
*  And I think the economic situation is a real vulnerability for this regime. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=668.54s)]
*  And we have seen a couple of instances of economically based [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=673.74s)]
*  protests breaking out despite the fact that there's a very high cost [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=679.02s)]
*  for any kind of protest right now in Egypt because of the very strong repression [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=684.34s)]
*  and and frankly, unprecedented level of human rights abuses. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=690.54s)]
*  Thanks. So I'd like to take that a little bit further with you. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=696.1s)]
*  So what you're saying is there's a high level of consolidation, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=699.86s)]
*  centralization politically and but in a way that you describe as brittle. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=703.74s)]
*  And I guess what I like to tease out some more with you is, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=710.1800000000001s)]
*  is it brittle because of the economic vulnerabilities you've been describing? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=713.7s)]
*  Or is it that the regime lacks certain kinds of domestic [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=720.54s)]
*  political alliances that would make it more resilient? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=724.5s)]
*  But linked to that, then, is you said very clearly that you think these economic [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=728.74s)]
*  challenges that are underlying the sort of very rosy headline picture, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=733.14s)]
*  that these could pose political social political challenges. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=737.78s)]
*  But there don't seem to be the political actors in Egypt who can turn that [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=741.78s)]
*  into an agenda for action, whether peaceful or otherwise. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=746.02s)]
*  And so what I guess I'm inviting you to do is to tell us a little bit more [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=750.8199999999999s)]
*  about the balance of politics internally. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=754.62s)]
*  But also how economics might bleed back into the politics. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=757.5799999999999s)]
*  Or do we just foresee that there'll be sort of spontaneous [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=763.02s)]
*  protests or riots here and there, as there have been in Egypt ever since the 1970s, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=767.9399999999999s)]
*  which ultimately don't go anywhere politically because there's no one [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=772.6199999999999s)]
*  to organize them and direct them in this sort of political vacuum. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=776.14s)]
*  So, you know, there's a bit more to tease out there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=780.02s)]
*  Economically, and this is related to domestic politics, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=782.74s)]
*  this is where Sisi, I think, has not broadened [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=787.42s)]
*  the base of his regime the way, for example, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=790.98s)]
*  former President Mubarak did. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=794.38s)]
*  Mubarak had a large base of civilian support [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=795.82s)]
*  outside the military and the security apparatus [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=800.38s)]
*  through the National Democratic Party, through the [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=804.1s)]
*  landowning families of Egypt, the [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=808.22s)]
*  landowning families of Egypt. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=811.06s)]
*  There was a there was a vast patronage machine [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=812.9s)]
*  that was a support for the regime, you know, out in the population. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=816.86s)]
*  Sisi does not have that to the same extent. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=822.06s)]
*  There is now this, you know, future of the nation, political block and so forth. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=824.62s)]
*  But we're not seeing the same kind of domestic [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=829.6999999999999s)]
*  political organization and importantly, the same kind of distribution [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=834.02s)]
*  of economic benefits and patronage to a wider circle [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=837.82s)]
*  of Egyptians, the way we saw under Mubarak. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=842.6600000000001s)]
*  So that that's a way the economic benefits, I think, in the Sisi regime [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=844.6600000000001s)]
*  are much more narrowly concentrated and especially within [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=850.1400000000001s)]
*  parts of the military itself. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=854.58s)]
*  Now, in terms of what could happen to threaten stability, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=857.2600000000001s)]
*  as you say, it's correct. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=862.0200000000001s)]
*  No, no political dissent is allowed. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=863.58s)]
*  We saw that very clearly with the Coalition of Hope, a group of peaceful, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=866.86s)]
*  secular politicians and business people who tried to form less last year [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=872.3000000000001s)]
*  with the idea of running in the parliamentary elections, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=878.0600000000001s)]
*  totally legal and peaceful activity. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=881.0600000000001s)]
*  It was absolutely crushed and they were all imprisoned. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=883.74s)]
*  And we've seen that kind of thing repeatedly. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=887.66s)]
*  So, you know, any dissent is crushed at the source. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=891.02s)]
*  But nonetheless, I want to point out that in 2018, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=894.5s)]
*  when when Sisi had to run for president again, there was a very notable [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=899.3000000000001s)]
*  outbreak of what I would call elite dissent. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=905.5400000000001s)]
*  You know, several one current and two former high ranking military officers, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=908.1800000000001s)]
*  as well as a couple of very prominent civilians stood up and said [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=914.38s)]
*  they wanted to run against Sisi and criticized him. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=917.94s)]
*  That was remarkable. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=922.0600000000001s)]
*  And they and they all paid a price for that. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=923.5s)]
*  Some of them are still imprisoned. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=926.22s)]
*  And then in 2019, we saw a fairly large [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=929.26s)]
*  outbreak of public dissent, totally chaotic, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=933.3000000000001s)]
*  economically based anti-corruption protest against Sisi. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=937.26s)]
*  More than 4000 people were arrested. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=942.62s)]
*  We saw another outbreak this year, probably not as large, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=945.1s)]
*  although it's extremely difficult to note because the Egyptian media [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=948.7800000000001s)]
*  doesn't cover these things this year. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=952.82s)]
*  Again, it was an economically based protest. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=955.6600000000001s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=958.9000000000001s)]
*  You know, what I would say is, should there be a large outbreak of protest [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=961.0200000000001s)]
*  or should there be a coup or some other elite way of removing Sisi? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=965.1800000000001s)]
*  People would look back and follow the breadcrumb trail and say, oh, yes, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=968.94s)]
*  we saw the signs of this coming. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=972.0200000000001s)]
*  You know, but but it's of course, it's it's very, very difficult [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=975.0200000000001s)]
*  to predict what will happen. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=979.1400000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying that despite the level of repression, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=981.1s)]
*  it is possible. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=986.14s)]
*  And we do see these very surprising [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=987.22s)]
*  outbreaks of either elite or popular [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=990.3000000000001s)]
*  dissent against Sisi cropping up from time to time. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=994.1800000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Michelle. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=999.14s)]
*  You know, Egypt is often compared with Tunisia. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1002.4200000000001s)]
*  They were the two first Arab Spring countries in both cases, the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1005.26s)]
*  the position of the armed forces was crucial in determining the fate [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1010.98s)]
*  of the former presidents for life. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1015.5s)]
*  In both cases, the armed forces effectively support in one way or the other, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1017.9s)]
*  the ouster of the two presidents. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1021.86s)]
*  But from there on, the armed forces took very different roles [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1023.9399999999999s)]
*  in the transitional processes. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1027.82s)]
*  And, of course, ever since then, Tunisia has been held up as the [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1029.5s)]
*  pretty positive example of where the Arab Spring succeeded [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1034.34s)]
*  in bringing about a new kind of pluralist politics [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1037.82s)]
*  and a peaceful transition that has been maintained despite a lot of challenges. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1043.1s)]
*  Now, you know, this is a sort of this is the the the the good news. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1047.86s)]
*  Tunisia clearly continues to face very serious challenges. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1052.7s)]
*  And it is really time to dig down into some of those. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1056.02s)]
*  But I'm going to start with that idea that 10 years later, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1060.22s)]
*  Tunisia's transition is somehow held up. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1063.46s)]
*  How do you assess it, Hamza? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1067.3s)]
*  With them. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1068.94s)]
*  Thanks, Yazid. Actually, yes, I mean, the it's clear, I mean, that 10 years [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1073.18s)]
*  after the the removal of the dictatorship, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1077.78s)]
*  actually the democracy in Tunisia is under strain, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1082.3s)]
*  especially with high levels of [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1086.3799999999999s)]
*  protest movements and unpopular contestation, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1090.46s)]
*  with also serious and major social and economic challenges [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1094.5s)]
*  the country, I mean, is facing today and the government is facing today. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1099.9s)]
*  So it's clear that this is really, I mean, a big challenge or a big [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1105.9s)]
*  the Tunisian democracy is under a big, big pressure, if I would say. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1111.5s)]
*  I mean, as you mentioned, Tunisia had a lot, I mean, made a lot of progress [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1115.6200000000001s)]
*  on the political and democratic side, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1121.3s)]
*  I mean, with the organisation of elections, whether general, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1125.74s)]
*  presidential, I mean, parliamentary or even, I mean, municipal elections in 2018. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1130.1s)]
*  The countries and the elites, political elites, manage to compromise [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1135.98s)]
*  and to find the middle ground at some point [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1141.1s)]
*  to to stick to sort of or to adopt [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1145.3s)]
*  a sort of transactional politics, a consensus politics, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1148.86s)]
*  avoiding, of course, this polarisation that we have [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1153.46s)]
*  we saw in other countries and especially in Egypt, as you as you mentioned. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1157.3s)]
*  Now, the big challenge actually is that [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1162.54s)]
*  what is really missing at some point is this incapacity of the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1167.02s)]
*  of the post 2011 governments to address [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1171.8999999999999s)]
*  the social and economic issues, the expectations of of of people. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1176.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, those expectations were and let's recall it [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1183.8600000000001s)]
*  at the beginning of the of the of the of the Arab Spring [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1188.0200000000002s)]
*  and of the of the interests in 2011. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1193.22s)]
*  And of course, those inmate expectations [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1196.2600000000002s)]
*  are and this incapacity of the government of the governments, actually, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1200.98s)]
*  is is feeding sort of discontent, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1206.94s)]
*  is feeding also sort of a lack of trust [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1212.0600000000002s)]
*  and endangering the trust even in democracy and in the democratic institutions. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1216.0200000000002s)]
*  So this is this is basically the situation in Tunisia. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1221.5800000000002s)]
*  Actually, it's 10 years later. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1225.74s)]
*  There is still hope, but there are a lot of challenges. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1229.3400000000001s)]
*  And actually, it's time for the economics at some point here. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1233.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean, many elites have been debating, struggling [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1237.58s)]
*  and even going into conflict conflicts over identity issues. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1243.1s)]
*  But now there is a common at some point, a common perception [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1247.9399999999998s)]
*  that it's time for the economy that could not. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1252.02s)]
*  And we cannot really delay any more these crucial social and economic reforms. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1255.6599999999999s)]
*  That I mean, you've set the stage perfectly for where I want to go next with this. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1263.86s)]
*  You mentioned the disappointment of social and economic expectations, [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1270.02s)]
*  and you've linked that to the transitional process. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1274.3s)]
*  And it's remarkable and admirable, of course, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1276.58s)]
*  that key elements of the democratic process, starting with elections, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1279.6999999999998s)]
*  but then deeper aspects of that have been maintained. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1284.06s)]
*  The principle of dialogue and of peaceful dialogue has been maintained. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1287.62s)]
*  These are crucial issues. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1291.06s)]
*  But at the same time, there's a risk, isn't there, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1293.3799999999999s)]
*  that of overburdening these aspects and making them always be sufficient [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1296.4199999999998s)]
*  to keep things going along when such deep social economic challenges [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1302.3799999999999s)]
*  have not yet been adequately addressed. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1306.3799999999999s)]
*  And so what I what I want to put to you is that one criticism [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1309.5s)]
*  I've seen directed pretty much every government Tunisia has had since 2011 [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1313.82s)]
*  is the failure to develop programs, concrete programs and policies [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1320.46s)]
*  addressing specific social economic issues, investment, productivity, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1325.94s)]
*  growth, disparities between South and North, rural and urban, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1331.26s)]
*  the interior of the coast, and that every government that comes in [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1335.94s)]
*  and then the next one that comes along, it's the same sort of challenges and problems. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1340.54s)]
*  So how do you explain that? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1345.06s)]
*  And of course, some of these these issues led to, for instance, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1348.5s)]
*  Tunisia being the largest exporter of disappointed young youths [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1352.1000000000001s)]
*  who went off to Syria to fight, you know, as jihadists, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1357.02s)]
*  an extraordinary contrast, again, with Tunisia's secular [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1361.06s)]
*  and democratic success in some respects. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1364.14s)]
*  So how do you explain that there was such a body of, you know, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1367.22s)]
*  disappointed expectation that led to the first Arab Spring [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1371.42s)]
*  in protest in the first place in 2010 and 11. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1375.7s)]
*  And yet, despite the failure to address those expectations, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1379.62s)]
*  somehow the political process has continued. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1384.02s)]
*  So that's part of the question. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1386.62s)]
*  The other part is you said you ended very nicely saying [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1387.82s)]
*  now there's an understanding that there has to be a focus on the economy. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1391.54s)]
*  Why should this be any more successful? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1395.34s)]
*  I mean, there are clearly very real obstacles, political, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1397.1s)]
*  but also, you know, vested interest groups [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1400.82s)]
*  resist change for one reason or another. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1403.9s)]
*  Why should we expect that's going to be any different now? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1406.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, you perfectly described the situation, Yazeed. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1409.7800000000002s)]
*  I mean, it was clear that the Tunisian elites, they succeeded at some point [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1413.14s)]
*  in establishing a sort of power sharing agreement in 2013 [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1416.94s)]
*  through this national dialogue, facilitated and mediated by national organizations. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1423.38s)]
*  Now, when it comes to the economic issues, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1429.5400000000002s)]
*  there is a need for a wealth sharing agreement. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1432.02s)]
*  And this is really lacking today in Tunisia. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1435.38s)]
*  And I do think that, I mean, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1438.58s)]
*  it's maybe we keep saying here in Tunisia that, you know, it's more [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1443.9s)]
*  it's easier for people to make concession on ideology, maybe on identity issues. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1449.18s)]
*  But when it comes to interests, it's more difficult, difficult, actually. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1455.78s)]
*  And this is one of the major obstacles. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1459.86s)]
*  You mentioned the vested interest and I would mention also, I mean, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1462.46s)]
*  the the labor union, the business unions, the corporations in the country. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1466.98s)]
*  So Tunisian elites and political elites and governments, they have today [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1473.98s)]
*  to manage all these veto groups, these groups who have veto power [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1478.62s)]
*  over all decision, economic and social decisions [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1484.98s)]
*  that could eventually hurt their constituency. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1488.1s)]
*  The UGTT is a major player in Tunisia, of course. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1492.1s)]
*  It is, I mean, representing the state dependent middle classes, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1496.6599999999999s)]
*  and especially with today with the need for reforming the state owned companies, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1502.74s)]
*  the over bloated public sector with the inflation of the public sector [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1509.86s)]
*  wage bill as well. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1515.78s)]
*  There is a need to open a frank dialogue and to get really concessions from the UGTT. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1517.3s)]
*  But it's the same as well. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1523.66s)]
*  And this is the case with economic elites, with business elites who are [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1525.66s)]
*  who have been actually benefiting from from renseeking positions, etc. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1531.1399999999999s)]
*  from sort of completely broken fiscal system. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1536.1399999999999s)]
*  So there is there is a need for reforming. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1539.98s)]
*  I mean, Tunisian capitalism, I would say, and to rethink, I mean, the [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1542.54s)]
*  or to negotiate the fiscal reform, to negotiate with different social groups [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1549.3799999999999s)]
*  and economic groups. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1555.4199999999998s)]
*  And this is this is not easy, actually. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1556.82s)]
*  Many governments have been they tried, but actually it's the political configuration. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1561.06s)]
*  It's so shaky, so uncertain, so fragile [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1567.9399999999998s)]
*  that it's clear that the political political [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1571.66s)]
*  of the governments and political elites are more interested in securing, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1576.94s)]
*  stabilizing their their their that I mean, their situation [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1583.02s)]
*  and not really acting actively towards social and economic reforms. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1588.78s)]
*  Now, I do think that really, I mean, especially with the covid crisis, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1595.9s)]
*  which completely worsened the macroeconomic indicators with, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1601.46s)]
*  I mean, unemployment, etc, etc. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1608.26s)]
*  I mean, unemployment, poverty rates, I mean, high levels of debt, etc. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1610.34s)]
*  I do think that today there is a need to [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1617.06s)]
*  to to elaborate or to strike a social and economic agreement. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1623.18s)]
*  Now, the situation is completely different in Tunisia than Egypt. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1628.98s)]
*  I mean, in Egypt, there is at some point a dictatorship able to to govern [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1634.14s)]
*  through decrees, through in authoritative way. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1640.26s)]
*  This is not the case in Tunisia, but governing through consensus [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1646.9s)]
*  is also tricky, is not obvious. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1651.26s)]
*  So there is a need for all these economic actors and political actors [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1655.7s)]
*  to end this war of attrition they have been involved in [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1661.7s)]
*  and to sit around maybe in the table of negotiation [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1666.66s)]
*  to discuss really mutual concessions. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1671.18s)]
*  And this is what actually some some some political actors [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1674.3400000000001s)]
*  and and social and economic actors are currently discussion [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1679.42s)]
*  and and and trying really to implement on the ground. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1684.3799999999999s)]
*  There are, of course, it's not easy. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1690.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's it's it's I mean, it wasn't easy in the past. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1692.6599999999999s)]
*  And it won't be easy today. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1696.6999999999998s)]
*  But I do think that there is a serious threat, really, when it when we see [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1698.5s)]
*  the the trust in democracy, the trust in democratic institutions, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1703.4599999999998s)]
*  that I mean, the the level of trust is at its lowest. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1708.8999999999999s)]
*  And there is another game changer at some point that we we saw [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1714.34s)]
*  it clearly in 2019 in the elections, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1719.26s)]
*  which is the rise of radical groups and of populist groups, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1722.6999999999998s)]
*  of some hybrid groups that that that are really, really [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1726.98s)]
*  will for sure, I mean, reshape the political landscape. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1732.3s)]
*  They are threatening political parties, many political parties. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1736.82s)]
*  And another is the Miss Party is one of them who have been [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1740.34s)]
*  actively playing an important and an active and active role [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1744.34s)]
*  in the transition since 2011. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1749.1399999999999s)]
*  They are we are we we see sort of weakening of these all these parties [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1752.3s)]
*  and the rise of more radical and and populist [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1758.86s)]
*  parties. And of course, this is also another signal, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1763.1799999999998s)]
*  another serious alarm that [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1767.58s)]
*  this it is this it is, I mean, whether social, economic or political [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1771.22s)]
*  it is, they have really now to come to the moment of [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1775.54s)]
*  of of truth and not delay the economic reforms anymore. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1780.1399999999999s)]
*  I believe we've lost contact with Yazeed for the moment, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1790.22s)]
*  so I'm going to take over briefly as moderator. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1793.18s)]
*  And Dalia, I'd like to turn to you, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1796.82s)]
*  to talk about Algeria. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1799.66s)]
*  So, you know, Algeria [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1802.0600000000002s)]
*  has witnessed a major protest movement last year. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1805.9s)]
*  But it seems that between [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1811.5800000000002s)]
*  activities that the regime did and the pandemic itself, that [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1815.5800000000002s)]
*  opposition has somehow quieted down or been absorbed. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1821.1000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm curious what the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1825.1000000000001s)]
*  current situation, what we see in Algeria as one hopes the pandemic recedes. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1828.34s)]
*  And what are the prospects for real change going forward? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1833.62s)]
*  Thank you, Michelle. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1839.3s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1840.6599999999999s)]
*  As you said, the HRAC was able to succeed in a few tangible [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1841.86s)]
*  and got some tangible results. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1847.06s)]
*  But unfortunately, when you see the energy or at least the energy [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1849.06s)]
*  that I felt in the in the last year, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1853.86s)]
*  the energy that I felt in the in the streets of Algeria and Algiers in 2019, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1856.66s)]
*  this massive crowds that have taken up to the street. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1863.5400000000002s)]
*  And then you see the result. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1867.8600000000001s)]
*  There is something missing. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1869.46s)]
*  So the question is really why such a mass movement achieved so little [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1871.14s)]
*  and how the regime was able to absorb this movement. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1876.1000000000001s)]
*  I think the regime played on the two flows of the HRAC, which were [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1883.86s)]
*  and practical and practical demands and the absence of leadership. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1888.58s)]
*  And the third element was that the regime strategy was pretty good [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1894.1799999999998s)]
*  because it's self restrained and use calibrated coercion. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1899.1399999999999s)]
*  So the first element with, you know, what many Algerians to whom I talk [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1904.1s)]
*  called unrealistic demands for many Algerians [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1908.6599999999999s)]
*  and who are there, who participated in the HRAC, a key reason for the low [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1912.74s)]
*  success of the movement and for the ability of the regime to absorb it [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1920.34s)]
*  was its inability. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1925.06s)]
*  OK, friends, I think I think there may be a power outage in Beirut. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1932.74s)]
*  So we'll hopefully we'll get we'll get Dalia back soon [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1938.34s)]
*  and be able to finish with Algeria. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1942.6599999999999s)]
*  But for now, Fred, let me go back to you on Libya. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1944.82s)]
*  There are a couple of questions that have come in from the audience. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1948.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to read them out to you, Fred. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1954.02s)]
*  Do you believe there are risks of internal conflict within the GNA [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1957.22s)]
*  that could affect their ability to defend against a renewed LNA offensive? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1962.1s)]
*  And then also another question, could you speak, Fred, on both the GNA [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1969.9399999999998s)]
*  leadership and Haftar's views on the US? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1974.4199999999998s)]
*  Let's put it so we're going to get back to US policy in a moment. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1977.6999999999998s)]
*  But maybe you could answer the initial questions on the GNA. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1980.82s)]
*  Right. That's a great question. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1987.06s)]
*  I briefly stated, I mean, the answer is yes. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1988.1799999999998s)]
*  On the GNA fragmentation. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1990.42s)]
*  I mean, when you had this existential threat to Tripoli, the various factions, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1992.18s)]
*  the various armed groups put aside their differences, they defended the capital. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=1997.7s)]
*  And then once that was removed, you've had those differences reemerge. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2001.14s)]
*  You have immense jockeying now, you know, personal rivalries within the GNA [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2005.7s)]
*  over appointments. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2012.18s)]
*  You've got games being played. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2014.42s)]
*  You've got rivalries within specific towns like the powerhouse town of Misrata. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2016.18s)]
*  You've got armed groups dragging their feet on the ceasefire implementation [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2022.5800000000002s)]
*  because they're trying to accrue more privileges. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2027.8600000000001s)]
*  You have militias that have basically captured entire ministries. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2032.5s)]
*  So I don't think we're on the break of open street fighting in Tripoli. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2039.46s)]
*  But again, I think if there were a conflict to arise in the oil crescent, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2043.62s)]
*  which is obviously far removed from the capital, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2050.02s)]
*  would you have a willing coalition of armed groups that would go to that location? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2053.38s)]
*  I think that speaks to the other issue of the international involvement, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2059.46s)]
*  that the Turks have now put Syrian mercenaries on the ground [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2063.94s)]
*  and that those foreign fighters could be deployed in a renewed conflict [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2067.7s)]
*  because perhaps of the unreliability of the of the fractious GNA coalition. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2072.66s)]
*  Michelle, are you handing back to me now? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2082.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2086.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2087.7s)]
*  I mean, I just had the fourth electricity cut of the day here in Beirut, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2088.5s)]
*  at least where I am, and I apologize to everyone. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2093.14s)]
*  Dalia, you know, is having her cut. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2097.2999999999997s)]
*  I know we want her router reconnects, so we'll come back to her on Algeria. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2099.94s)]
*  Now, I seem to have come back in just around when you were talking to Fred [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2107.78s)]
*  with questions on internal dynamic. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2115.7000000000003s)]
*  Nancy, Dalia, have you joined us? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2120.26s)]
*  Yes, I'm here. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2123.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2125.94s)]
*  I believe you were addressing the first question. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2127.2200000000003s)]
*  You started to answer. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2129.14s)]
*  Yes, so I was answering the first question of Michelle. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2139.54s)]
*  That was how the regime was able to absorb the political movement. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2143.46s)]
*  So I was saying basically that the regime was able to absorb it [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2147.8599999999997s)]
*  because it played on the weaknesses of the Haraq itself, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2151.22s)]
*  which are two, one, unrealistic demands and realistic between quotes. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2154.74s)]
*  This is not a judgment. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2159.7s)]
*  This is the interviewer to whom I talk who used that word. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2160.8999999999996s)]
*  And the second thing is the lack of leadership. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2164.58s)]
*  And the third element is the self-restraint of the security forces [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2169.14s)]
*  and the use of calibrated coercion. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2175.14s)]
*  So this is how the regime was able to absorb the Haraq. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2177.2999999999997s)]
*  Regarding the Haraq, a key reason actually to explain why also the Haraq was unable to achieve [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2181.7s)]
*  such a mass movement was unable to achieve tangible result is the inexistence of a workable goal. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2189.8599999999997s)]
*  Of a clear roadmap for the day after. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2199.2999999999997s)]
*  Nobody actually thought about what can we do once Bouddiflika will be out [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2202.5s)]
*  and what do we really want? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2207.78s)]
*  What can we really achieve? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2209.86s)]
*  Moreover, there was no plan to keep protesters engaged [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2211.6200000000003s)]
*  and integrate them into the political process. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2215.6200000000003s)]
*  So it is the Haraq that is actually showing today some signs, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2218.9s)]
*  unfortunately, of vulnerability with a serious durable confrontation between troops. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2223.3s)]
*  Today we have in the Haraq the first group with impracticable and infeasible demands. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2229.38s)]
*  The force of the democratic alternative forces of the democratic alternative [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2236.26s)]
*  pact who refuses any kind of discussion or negotiation with the authorities [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2242.82s)]
*  and call for a total dissolution of the system. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2248.82s)]
*  And we have the second force which is called the democratic poll [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2252.1s)]
*  which calls for negotiating with the authorities to reach a consensus [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2258.26s)]
*  and whose representative backed up the national dialogue commission that was dissolved since then. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2264.02s)]
*  So the second element that played in favor of the regime is the absence of leadership. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2270.42s)]
*  As you may know, the movement refused to constitute itself and it remained leaderless [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2276.98s)]
*  and of affiliation with neither a Yaraq nor a Haraq. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2291.1400000000003s)]
*  They were at every protest as a matter of fact. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2295.94s)]
*  So a lot of kinds of leadership to their movement is very understandable [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2299.3s)]
*  because these are people who understood that any kind of leadership might be co-opted [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2305.94s)]
*  or might be marginalized or simply jailed. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2313.5400000000004s)]
*  So they refused to institutionalize their movement. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2317.38s)]
*  But again, change requires obtained political organizing. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2322.5800000000004s)]
*  Collectivism as we call it today might be sufficient to ignite and to ignite political energy, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2327.2200000000003s)]
*  but infrastructures are needed to channel that energy and translate it into political [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2333.86s)]
*  process and into public policies. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2341.1400000000003s)]
*  And collectivism is no longer enough. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2343.7s)]
*  Unfortunately, the Kufi halted the demonstrations and hence Algerians found themselves only able to [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2346.8199999999997s)]
*  be active on Twitter, on Facebook and so on and so forth. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2357.14s)]
*  The third element that made the regime also to absorb the Haraq, the popular movement, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2360.42s)]
*  it's behaved security forces. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2370.2599999999998s)]
*  At the beginning, the regime sent pretty strong signs that it will intervene against any [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2373.2200000000003s)]
*  suspicious calls for mobilization in the name of democracy. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2381.1400000000003s)]
*  But then it changed its strategy. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2385.38s)]
*  Why? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2389.06s)]
*  Because this immediately placed the event in the dramatic and traumatic historical frame [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2389.46s)]
*  that was Algiers October 5th, 1988, crackdown on protesters. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2396.9s)]
*  And so during these events, as we know, the army intervened and shot on sight. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2402.9s)]
*  Some 500 youngsters were killed back then. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2408.5s)]
*  And so in the following weeks, the regime, the authorities quickly came to understand [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2412.26s)]
*  that the crackdown would be a poor strategy, except on a few occasions, really, the police [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2418.1s)]
*  behaved calmly and with patience throughout the country and throughout one year of political [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2424.42s)]
*  protest. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2431.06s)]
*  So for a year, violence from the security forces was an exception rather than [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2431.78s)]
*  duties led to protests, vent their anger, seeded many parts of the city for demonstration, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2438.98s)]
*  and La Grande Poste became a landmark for protestors. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2445.86s)]
*  But President Boune himself validated their grievances and described their movement as [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2449.54s)]
*  blessed. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2454.82s)]
*  So this is one of the important elements in my view that made the regime able to absorb [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2455.62s)]
*  the popular protests. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2463.7799999999997s)]
*  OK, looks like I might be moderating again. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2472.42s)]
*  Yes, he might have dropped off again. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2475.06s)]
*  And Adelie, I just want to ask you a follow up question about Algeria while we have you, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2477.2999999999997s)]
*  which is, you know, did the pandemic just press the pause button on protests? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2484.66s)]
*  I mean, do you expect to see large scale protests return? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2491.38s)]
*  I understand what you said, that that's not necessarily the answer or the way for Algeria [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2496.58s)]
*  to move forward. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2501.7s)]
*  But it seems like there's very much unfinished business in Algeria, but that as in many places [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2503.46s)]
*  of the world that with the pandemic, people have, you know, have gone back, largely gone [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2512.18s)]
*  back inside. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2516.82s)]
*  So do you think that's going to make a difference? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2517.62s)]
*  I also wonder what you think the impact of the economic situation in Algeria and the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2521.3s)]
*  way the pandemic has kind of accelerated this oil, what I would say is the looming end of [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2530.66s)]
*  the oil and gas era or, you know, created a real glut in oil and gas supplies. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2537.54s)]
*  How's this going to affect the situation in Algeria as we look at the next year, two years? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2543.14s)]
*  Yes, yes, Michelle, for sure. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2550.42s)]
*  You know, the covid-19 pandemic halted the demonstration and the popular movement because, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2552.8199999999997s)]
*  people realized after a few weeks of the beginning of the pandemic that that was a serious threat, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2558.9s)]
*  serious security and health threat rather than a dirty political trick, because this is what [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2564.9s)]
*  millions of Algerians believed at the beginning. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2570.34s)]
*  They thought that it was a dirty political trick for the regime to stop the demonstration. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2572.82s)]
*  And then they understood. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2578.9s)]
*  And I think the movement has shown in general its mobilization potential, raised awareness [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2580.5s)]
*  and changed public opinion nationwide and internationally about how Algerians are in 2020, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2587.62s)]
*  what Algerians are expecting from their government. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2595.46s)]
*  However, it could not action any genuine institutional changes for now and impact [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2598.5s)]
*  the electoral process, because let us remember here that the presidential election, despite [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2604.58s)]
*  its cancellation twice happened on December 12, 2019, and also a referendum on the new [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2610.42s)]
*  constitution happened on November 1st, 2020. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2618.98s)]
*  So that means that the regime continue to do whatever it would take it took for it to survive. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2622.26s)]
*  And of course, you know, it is very hard to imagine the day after what is going to happen [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2632.42s)]
*  to these millions of Algerians who demonstrated. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2640.02s)]
*  Are they going to come back in the street? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2643.14s)]
*  Are they going, you know, after the end of the COVID to have the same mobilization potential again? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2645.7s)]
*  And this lead us to your question, which is the economic question. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2653.14s)]
*  I think that, you know, Algeria was hurt with the for the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2657.94s)]
*  you know, situation in Algeria was already back before the COVID-19. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2665.62s)]
*  What the COVID-19 did is it exacerbated the socio-economic problem. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2671.54s)]
*  So what I suspect is that while the first wave, if I may say, of the [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2677.7s)]
*  has been pretty political when we had Algerians taken up to the street asking for the end of the [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2684.98s)]
*  boot flea, his exit and for a civilian state, not a military one. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2692.74s)]
*  I believe that the second episode, the second season of the is going also to ask for socio-economic [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2698.1s)]
*  reforms because the social question is going to be at the heart of the because of this bad [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2706.5s)]
*  economic situation. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2712.58s)]
*  As you may know, many Arab and African state looked to the International Monetary Fund, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2714.74s)]
*  IMF for assistance to help counter the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2720.66s)]
*  But Algeria and the boot refused to do so. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2726.5s)]
*  This is due to mainly the crisis, you know, of the nineties and the trauma of the nineties [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2729.94s)]
*  because for Algerian authorities and for the Algerian people, there is a trauma with, you know, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2735.46s)]
*  of the nineties. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2745.22s)]
*  But what is the other solution? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2748.42s)]
*  We do know from the fact that from the figures that we have that the exchange reserve are [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2750.5s)]
*  depleted and the Algerian authorities, unfortunately, misused the surplus that they [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2756.82s)]
*  have accumulated during the 2000 and overspending without clear priorities and an effort to buy [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2763.3s)]
*  social peace and to keep their patronage network. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2771.06s)]
*  And so growing anger at the regime and the failure of its successive government to diversify the [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2774.34s)]
*  economy gave rise to the hierarch in 2019. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2784.1800000000003s)]
*  But I want to say that the same reason that led millions of Algerians to go to the street to [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2788.5s)]
*  demonstrate are still here today. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2795.06s)]
*  And I believe that the economic situation is going to worsen. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2797.1400000000003s)]
*  And so I would say once the hierarch again takes to the street after lockdown measures are lifted, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2801.14s)]
*  the regime will struggle with greater unrest. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2808.8199999999997s)]
*  The government has no more fiscal room left to transform the structure of Algeria's economy, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2812.74s)]
*  diversify its productive sector and increase its competitiveness. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2819.7s)]
*  And hence, the upcoming months are going really to be very challenging for the Algerian [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2825.22s)]
*  economy, for the Algerian people, but also especially for the Algerian regime. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2831.06s)]
*  Thanks, Dalia. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2835.54s)]
*  Since I'm back after the fifth power cut of the day, and I hope there won't be any others [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2840.82s)]
*  before we finish this panel, I want to go back to another round in which I'm going to shift the [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2846.42s)]
*  focus much more to foreign policy while still allowing you the chance to come in on other [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2852.82s)]
*  dimensions and also so that we can bring in a bit of discussion of Morocco. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2857.78s)]
*  And I've been looking at the comments box here and looking at questions we're receiving from [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2863.0600000000004s)]
*  our audience. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2867.5400000000004s)]
*  So I'm integrating that into some of the questions I'm putting to you. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2868.5800000000004s)]
*  Fred, I'm going to go back to Libya, start with you. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2872.9s)]
*  And I may have missed a bit of this when I was enjoying the power cut. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2876.02s)]
*  And you may have spoken a little bit about the agency of Libyans. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2880.42s)]
*  You've said quite a bit about the dynamics, about the local dynamics among Libyan parties. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2883.8599999999997s)]
*  But I guess what I still don't get a sense of, or I'd like to get more of a sense of, is how, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2891.3799999999997s)]
*  given how much investment there is by external powers, how much external powers are playing out [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2897.54s)]
*  their own rivalries in Libya, but rivalries that extend well beyond Libya as well, does that mean [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2903.2999999999997s)]
*  that there's almost nothing the Libyans can do to minimize the impact of external power rivalry? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2911.3s)]
*  And given their own divisions, of course, are they condemned to endlessly play this game? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2919.1400000000003s)]
*  Do they have some real agency, whether that's the UN broker talks or some other channel? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2923.94s)]
*  And then I'm going to ask you to pull out and I'll come to the others with the same sort of [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2930.1000000000004s)]
*  question, which is pretty much, what can these countries expect from the new U.S. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2933.54s)]
*  administration from President Biden? And does that alter potentially how other major powers, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2940.34s)]
*  such as France and President Macron, may approach these countries? Because clearly, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2948.1800000000003s)]
*  when it comes to Libya and Egypt, but of course, Tunisia and Algeria and Morocco, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2952.9s)]
*  these two external powers are really major, along with the EU here and there, Russia, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2957.78s)]
*  potentially China in some cases. So start with you, Fred, first on the Libyan agency aspect. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2963.46s)]
*  Then if you zoom out and I'll carry on looking at that foreign policy angle with everyone else. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2970.34s)]
*  Yeah, great question, Izzy. So I think this notion of Libya as an arena for regional [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2977.86s)]
*  power rivalries is absolutely valid. And it goes back to the 2011 revolution where you had [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2984.58s)]
*  contending foreign backers even then. And so those regional rivalries were latent for a while. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2991.3s)]
*  They really exploded after 2014. And of course, the most obvious one is the Emirati bloc versus [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=2998.34s)]
*  the slash Turkish Qatari bloc. And these are deep rivalries over visions for regional order, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3007.54s)]
*  economics, ideology, Islamism. I think these are well known. And so you do have a sense in Libya [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3015.54s)]
*  that there's a sense of victimization. And especially after these warring foreign powers [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3020.7400000000002s)]
*  deployed their own military forces on the ground, you got the sense. And I was in Libya in January [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3026.9s)]
*  of this year, you talk to ordinary Libyans, they say, look, the fate of our country is not in our [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3032.1800000000003s)]
*  hands. It's being decided in Ankara, Moscow, Abu Dhabi, Berlin. And there's a lot of truth to that. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3037.46s)]
*  For instance, when Turkey deployed these Syrian mercenaries, I talked to GNA armed commanders, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3043.94s)]
*  and they said, look, we don't want these foreign infantry guys. And the Turkish response is, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3049.7000000000003s)]
*  tough luck. And so in the fighting that has ensued, the foreign powers have cut out the Libyans in [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3054.34s)]
*  terms of targeting, deployment. They've got their own drones, their own foreign forces on the ground. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3061.06s)]
*  And that gives them enormous leverage. And now, as I mentioned, they're occupying key strategic sites, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3066.98s)]
*  military bases. The Russians are in oil installation, so they've got leverage over [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3072.5s)]
*  the economic assets. However, and I want to caveat something, the Libyans still do have agency. And [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3077.6200000000003s)]
*  it's a negative form of agency. They can spoil. They can frustrate the demands of their patrons. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3084.1s)]
*  You've had various people walk out of meetings. Heftar is famous for this. Various foreign powers [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3090.3399999999997s)]
*  expect him to do something, and he frustrates their demands. You have a lot of frustration, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3096.66s)]
*  obviously, from the Russians who've soured on Heftar, the Egyptians who are trying to contain [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3101.2999999999997s)]
*  him, their opening lines to other Libyan actors. The Turks have been frustrated [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3106.34s)]
*  with the GNA, and much of this has to do with fragmentation. These foreign powers [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3113.3s)]
*  are confronted with a very hyperlocal, fragmented power structure. They don't know the right buttons [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3118.58s)]
*  to push. And so I do think Libyans still have some agency. They're also very adept at playing [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3124.58s)]
*  foreign powers off against each other. You've had the GNA now opening a line to France. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3131.2999999999997s)]
*  You've had Heftar maneuvering between different powers. And so this is a game that they've played. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3138.1s)]
*  I want to end on something related to international mediation. What you've had international [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3143.3799999999997s)]
*  mediators say, the line that they're telling Libyans, is that unless you bridge your differences, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3148.66s)]
*  unless you make peace among yourselves, you're not going to have a country that's your own. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3154.8999999999996s)]
*  The foreigners are going to be in the driver's seat. And so international medias are trying to [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3160.02s)]
*  appeal to Libyan nationalism, xenophobia, that there's a window now that you got to act on it, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3163.86s)]
*  or else you're going to surrender your sovereignty. That's fine, but we have to remember, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3169.62s)]
*  and I'll end on this, there are Libyan elites that benefit from that foreign patronage, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3174.1s)]
*  and they have no qualms about selling out their country because they're enjoying that foreign [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3178.82s)]
*  support. That's a hugely important point to end on there, but now let's move on and pull in [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3183.22s)]
*  this other really important actor, which so far has been pretty absent, and that's the US [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3193.7s)]
*  administration. Clearly, the US could do a lot for bad and for good. And the US role in Libya has [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3197.7799999999997s)]
*  been quite pivotal, starting with 2011, backing the NATO involvement, and then pulling back, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3205.22s)]
*  of course, in the last few years. Will that change the overall picture? Will it change [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3211.46s)]
*  the behavior of the other competing regional powers and external powers? But could it play [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3218.18s)]
*  into these internal dynamics and elite dynamics you've just mentioned in a way that might [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3224.26s)]
*  mitigate, soften, improve? Yeah, that's a great question. Absolutely, the US has a huge role. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3231.06s)]
*  It did pull back. When you talk to Libyans, I think they sometimes exaggerate the influence [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3240.02s)]
*  of the US to solve this issue. But I think at the very least, moving forward to the Biden [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3244.98s)]
*  administration, under Trump, it was an incredibly negative type of role related to his impulsive [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3250.82s)]
*  signaling and his deference to a particular block of Arab autocrats who were acting in Libya, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3258.42s)]
*  obviously Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, who felt emboldened, obviously, by personal phone [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3264.74s)]
*  calls. And so I think under Biden, you'll have a pulling back of that. You'll have more process. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3271.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know that Biden will want to own Libya, given the competing priorities. But I want to [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3279.14s)]
*  emphasize, even a very minimal diplomatic investment by the United States could have a [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3286.74s)]
*  qualitative effect in terms of signaling, in terms of convening and building consensus. I think the [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3292.58s)]
*  US has enormous convening power, obviously, among its regional allies like Egypt and the Emirates. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3300.58s)]
*  It's unclear to me if the Biden administration is going to want to penalize spoilers like the United [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3310.18s)]
*  Arab Emirates because it may perceive that it needs the Emirates on other regional priorities, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3316.74s)]
*  obviously the Abraham Accords, you've got Iran. And so there's always been a triaging of priorities [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3322.58s)]
*  when it comes to Libya. And unfortunately, Libya has ranked fairly low. It's not deemed as absolutely [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3328.8999999999996s)]
*  essential in the US interests. And so you've had these other regional states feeling emboldened [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3334.1s)]
*  that they can just maneuver and play their games. You do have other actors besides the [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3339.54s)]
*  administrative, the executive branch in the United States. Congress is taking a hard look at [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3346.66s)]
*  Libya and regional spoilers. There's the Libya Stabilization Act that passed in the House. And this, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3353.62s)]
*  I think, could send a signal to foreign interveners. Again, I want to believe that the US [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3358.9s)]
*  can play a role, I think, especially in tempering the European disunity. The Europeans have been very [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3367.3s)]
*  fragmented on Libya and the French, I think, have been allowed to play an helpful role. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3375.86s)]
*  And part of that is a function of broken transatlantic relations. And so if the US [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3381.78s)]
*  were to backstop more of European diplomacy, I think that might also have a signaling effect. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3387.46s)]
*  But just to conclude, we shouldn't raise our expectations too much. The US has always viewed [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3394.18s)]
*  Libya through the lens of something else. Obviously, for a while, it was counterterrorism. And the [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3400.58s)]
*  terrorist threat has diminished significantly. The US can conduct counterterrorism operations [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3408.02s)]
*  in Libya right now, regardless of working through local proxies or regardless if there's a unified [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3414.66s)]
*  government. And so I guess bottom line, modest optimism, but we shouldn't get our hopes up too [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3419.94s)]
*  much. Thanks, Fred, on Libya. Michelle, clearly one of the other major actors in Libya is Egypt. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3426.34s)]
*  And Egypt's own relationships with both the US administration and the French presidency [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3440.42s)]
*  have always been really important. Well, certainly with France, it's very important since [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3446.5s)]
*  President Pissé's visit to Paris, which provoked quite a lot of unhappiness here and there. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3454.34s)]
*  The award of the Légion d'honneur medal to Sissi in a rather odd manner, where there's almost no [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3461.94s)]
*  publicity about it. And then there's a sort of justification that, oh, well, we give the medal to [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3468.74s)]
*  all visiting presidents and heads of state, which I'm told is not actually true. But regardless of [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3476.5s)]
*  the specifics of this particular visit, it looks like Sissi has won and is retaining [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3485.3s)]
*  a lot of international recognition of his administration, of his policies, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3493.14s)]
*  which includes effectively not just on Libya, but also at home. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3499.46s)]
*  And can Sissi in fact continue to count on this level of US support, calculating, for instance, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3505.7s)]
*  that the Egyptian presidency has seen many US presidents come and go, there are those who've [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3512.9s)]
*  emphasized human rights, there have been mild penalties from the Obama administration after [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3518.42s)]
*  2013 on the coup d'etat. Should Sissi worry at all, really? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3522.66s)]
*  Well, first of all, to give President Sissi his due, I think that building a pretty solid wall of [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3532.42s)]
*  international support for his regime has been one of his successes. He does, of course, have a few [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3540.3399999999997s)]
*  enemies, Turkey, Qatar in particular, but in terms of the major international powers, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3548.42s)]
*  Sissi has built a lot of support and has diversified support, and this is how he's done it. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3555.54s)]
*  In an odd way, he has played on both Egypt's strengths and its weaknesses to get international [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3560.58s)]
*  support. I mentioned already that he's gone on an enormous arms spending spree. Most of those arms [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3567.38s)]
*  sales, arms purchases have come from Europe, from France in particular, but Germany and Italy and [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3575.38s)]
*  Britain, and to a lesser degree, Russia as well. And then of course he continues to buy US arms [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3584.26s)]
*  with the assistance that's provided to him from the United States, from American taxpayers. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3592.5s)]
*  So there are many arms purchases, but then there's also the indebtedness. And in an odd way, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3598.34s)]
*  I think that Sissi has gotten the international community to invest in him by loaning to Egypt. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3603.9399999999996s)]
*  I mean, he's now borrowed $20 billion from the IMF over the last five years, including [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3610.18s)]
*  significant loans this year. About a third of that was this year alone. And then there will be more, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3617.3799999999997s)]
*  because Egypt needs at least $10 billion of external financing every single year to meet its costs. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3623.4599999999996s)]
*  And so Sissi has sort of bound those in the international community to himself. And he has [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3631.54s)]
*  a military and commercial relationship with Russia, a development relationship with China, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3640.5s)]
*  and so forth. So all of these are sources of strength for Sissi to some extent. Now, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3646.5s)]
*  you asked about the United States. So what's changing here? Now, first of all, let me say, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3654.1s)]
*  what's not going to change is that no one in the international community, none of these allies want [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3659.22s)]
*  to destabilize Egypt. And they all, including the United States, I think, fear the consequences of [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3666.58s)]
*  instability in Egypt. In particular, Western Europeans fear instability of Egypt because they [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3672.02s)]
*  fear mass migration either from Egypt or through Egypt from the rest of the African continent, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3678.18s)]
*  as well as the possibility of terrorism in Europe. So no one wants to destabilize Egypt. And that [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3684.9s)]
*  will be true of the incoming administration of President-elect Biden as well. There's no desire [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3693.0600000000004s)]
*  to destabilize Egypt. At the same time, it's going to be a different climate for Sissi. Sissi had in [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3698.82s)]
*  President Trump a special friend in the White House who did special favors for him, many of them. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3708.1s)]
*  I don't think he's going to have that in President Biden. I think there's not a personal [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3715.62s)]
*  relationship that I'm aware of between Biden and Sissi of any significance. And anyway, I just don't [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3721.14s)]
*  think President-elect Biden is going to do policy the way that Trump has done with all these sort of [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3728.2599999999998s)]
*  special deals and special favors. Fred used the word process for the Biden administration, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3736.5s)]
*  and I think that's true. I think it will be a return of kind of the normal American national [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3743.94s)]
*  security policymaking process, national security interests, rather than personal interests at the [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3748.9s)]
*  center of this. And I do think there will be some questions. There are questions. I think there have [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3755.7s)]
*  been increasing questions in the U.S. Congress, as well as in some quarters of the administration, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3763.38s)]
*  about exactly how valuable is this relationship with Egypt. As I said, nobody wants to destabilize [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3769.54s)]
*  the country, but will the same level of aid continue? Will the same level of political and [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3778.5s)]
*  diplomatic support to Egypt, and frankly, to the military, to military rule in Egypt, continue under [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3785.62s)]
*  the Biden administration? I don't know. We have yet to see. And I just want to add, Yazeed, that [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3793.3s)]
*  there are some very big policy questions that the Biden administration faces in this region. Of course, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3799.7000000000003s)]
*  there's the question of Iran and how to handle somehow getting back into an agreement to [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3806.1000000000004s)]
*  contain Iran's nuclear program. Egypt's not a major player in that, by the way, and Iran's not a major [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3816.5s)]
*  concern for Egypt. But there's something else, which is, I think the Biden administration, as with [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3822.98s)]
*  the Trump and the Obama administrations before it, is going to want to continue to find ways to diminish [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3828.7400000000002s)]
*  U.S. military presence and military involvement in the Middle East. And the question is how to do that. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3836.1s)]
*  The argument that's being put forward by many, and I would say with the United Arab Emirates in the [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3843.38s)]
*  lead, is this means that the United States should transfer very sophisticated arms to its allies in [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3850.1s)]
*  the Middle East. And we see the Trump administration putting forward a package for the UAE. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3857.86s)]
*  There's a question as to how this will go and whether the Biden administration will accept [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3866.02s)]
*  that logic or whether they will slow it down. Because the arms that have been transferred in [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3870.3399999999997s)]
*  the past are used not only for these countries to defend themselves but to intervene in each other's [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3875.86s)]
*  affairs, notably the UAE intervening in Libya, Egypt intervening in Libya to some extent, Yemen, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3882.1800000000003s)]
*  et cetera. And so all of these big policy questions, particularly as to how the United States [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3892.34s)]
*  reconfigures its presence and its involvement in the region, are going to affect policies [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3900.1800000000003s)]
*  toward Egypt and Libya in particular. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3909.1400000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Michelle. I'm very pleased you ended on Libya and Egypt and the military dimension of the [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3914.42s)]
*  U.S. relationship because we've just had a question in about whether Egypt might act to enforce the [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3922.98s)]
*  Jouffre-Serta line in Libya. I mean, if you could speak quite briefly on that just to give us a [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3929.6200000000003s)]
*  sense of whether Egypt, I mean, clearly faces a balance of on the one hand being maybe emboldened [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3936.98s)]
*  enough to intervene, but it wouldn't do that unless it really felt that was necessary. So [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3943.2200000000003s)]
*  what's your quick one minute on that? Well, I'll say something quickly about it, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3949.78s)]
*  but I'd love to hear what Fred would say as well. Look, I mean, Egypt has legitimate security [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3954.42s)]
*  concerns about Libya. It's a very long border, very difficult to police. We have seen in the past [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3960.7400000000002s)]
*  arms coming across, militants coming across into Egypt. So Egypt has legitimate security concerns. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3967.78s)]
*  At the same time, you know, I think Egypt's capabilities of doing that kind of an action [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3974.26s)]
*  are limited and it certainly wouldn't want to be unsuccessful. That would be a big problem [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3983.2999999999997s)]
*  for Egypt, both in terms of its border security, as well as even internally in Egypt. In the [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3990.58s)]
*  Egyptian military, you know, they don't like to try to project power a lot because they don't want [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=3997.8599999999997s)]
*  to be exposed as being not as strong as they want to appear. But I'd be curious to hear what Fred [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4003.62s)]
*  thinks will happen. Yes, Fred, please. Yeah, just to add to that. I mean, I don't think they want [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4013.38s)]
*  to be dragged into a into a quagmire. There are issues of logistics, their own capability. They [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4019.54s)]
*  were never a fan of Heftar's attack on Tripoli last year. Of course, they supported Heftar as a [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4024.98s)]
*  local client on their border for border security. But they've they've since soured on him. Again, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4032.26s)]
*  they're they're trying to keep him in a box. I've been told that there's sort of a new [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4038.5800000000004s)]
*  pragmatic trend in Egyptian leadership on the Libyan file from the intelligence service. And, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4043.38s)]
*  you know, Egypt has shown a willingness to engage with Turkey and sort of de-escalate. And so, you [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4049.6200000000003s)]
*  know, maybe a nominal deployment to that area. But again, I don't think they want to get dragged [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4056.18s)]
*  in. It's not in their interest to see a massive outbreak of conflict. And, you know, as I've said, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4063.22s)]
*  they're they're they're souring on Heftar. They've already soured on him. They're looking, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4070.4199999999996s)]
*  you know, for a way out of this. Thanks. Thanks, Fred. So Tunisia, Hamza, these foreign relationships [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4075.94s)]
*  how critical are they? You know, do they? Starting with the military dimension, the security [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4086.66s)]
*  assistance, American military and security assistance to Tunisia over the past few years has [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4096.26s)]
*  escalated enormously, French and European as well. And there's clearly a huge investment in that. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4101.7s)]
*  Does this come at the expense of in helping the Tunisian economy, help the Tunisian government [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4109.7s)]
*  meet these social economic expectations we discussed right at the start? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4115.06s)]
*  Does it push it in ways that lead to maybe polarization in the country? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4119.620000000001s)]
*  You know, and all of this, of course, ties into finally Tunisia's relationships with Algeria on [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4125.3s)]
*  the one side, with Libya on the other, where, you know, clearly from Libya, there have been all sorts [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4130.1s)]
*  of threats and risks to Tunisia with the escalation of the risk of regional, direct regional and [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4135.38s)]
*  international clashes inside Libya. So it's an increasingly complex environment that Tunisia's [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4141.86s)]
*  never had to face before, I think. Maybe I'm wrong and you'll correct me, but how do you see this [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4147.7s)]
*  complex and specifically whether the new US administration and a sort of more activist [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4152.74s)]
*  French presidency, how does that really drive things forward for Tunisia? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4158.9s)]
*  Yeah, actually, you, I mean, your question is, is really good in the sense that security since [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4162.82s)]
*  2013 and 2014 has become one of the top priority really of the international cooperation between [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4175.38s)]
*  Tunisia and the international community, especially Europe and the US, as you mentioned. Of course, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4181.86s)]
*  I mean, the situation of Libya has played an important role in this. The fact, I mean, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4189.38s)]
*  the fear of spillover of the Libyan conflict, the border issues and border insecurities, sorry, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4197.3s)]
*  is a major driver for the international cooperation. The need as well to strengthen [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4207.860000000001s)]
*  the capacities of the Tunisian military in a specially shaky and uncertain regional environment. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4214.5s)]
*  So what I mean, these are really, I mean, the causes or the what explained the increase in the [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4223.62s)]
*  support on the security side of poor Tunisia from the international community. Now, what we have [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4231.86s)]
*  observed on the ground is this, the counter effect at some point or this backsliding effect of this, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4240.74s)]
*  of the heavy handed security approach or securitization, of course, of the border [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4250.26s)]
*  regions, of the south, especially. I mean, these are regions that have been suffering from neglect [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4256.66s)]
*  for decades. There is a huge lack of investment, public investment, and major problems when it [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4264.1s)]
*  comes to infrastructure, et cetera. So there is a need as well, I mean, to think about development, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4274.740000000001s)]
*  developing these regions, about thinking of alternatives and revenue creation activities [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4281.22s)]
*  for the communities who used to rely on cross border trade and smuggling, et cetera. So this is [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4290.9s)]
*  at some point one of the major concerns that went or they have been going hand in hand with the [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4302.58s)]
*  security, the strengthening of the security measures on the borders. As you mentioned, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4316.02s)]
*  I mean, Libya is very important for Tunisia. It used to be one of the major partners, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4325.3s)]
*  economic partners and trade partners for Tunisia. And with the situation in Libya, Tunisia lost an [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4332.34s)]
*  important partner. This situation in Algeria is not really, I mean, the cooperation is in terms [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4338.18s)]
*  of security and military cooperation is good. I mean, there is a strong cooperation on border [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4345.22s)]
*  policing, et cetera, between on both sides of the border. But when it comes to developing the [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4356.42s)]
*  long neglected regions on the northwest and center west Tunisia, I mean, there is no, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4363.54s)]
*  no, I mean, a lot has to be done on that side as well. So it seems like, you know, really Tunisia [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4372.26s)]
*  is getting isolated. There is a need for strong regional integration with neighbors, but neighbors [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4381.22s)]
*  are going themselves through, I mean, tough challenges. And of course, it seems also, and [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4391.14s)]
*  it's clear that the heavy investment on security is also made at the expense of more, maybe, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4399.38s)]
*  investment from the international community on development, on infrastructure, et cetera. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4412.18s)]
*  There is an important focus, which is understandable, I mean, on security, but it should be [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4418.82s)]
*  really, and this is clearly the, this is obvious, I mean, on the, especially in the south and in the [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4428.9s)]
*  border regions to promote as well, I mean, public investments and to think really often these, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4437.299999999999s)]
*  the involvement of international community in financing investments, et cetera, in these regions. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4445.219999999999s)]
*  So, yeah, this is basically the, I mean, this conundrum or this dilemma at some point between [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4452.58s)]
*  economy and security is here and Tunisia has been really struggling for a while now on how really to [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4462.0199999999995s)]
*  strike a good balance on security and development. And I do think that the international community [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4470.179999999999s)]
*  has to play a role on this. I mean, the heavy investment on security is really not really, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4477.86s)]
*  shouldn't be the only and sole answer to the complex challenges many regions of the country [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4489.7s)]
*  have been facing. Thanks Hamza. That was, you know, I think a very rich response. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4497.299999999999s)]
*  I'm going to come back to you because we're getting questions on some of the more sort of domestic [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4505.94s)]
*  issues again, so I'll hope to come back in a final round of questions a little bit later on. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4511.7s)]
*  But first I want to move to Algeria and put almost exactly the same question to Dalia where, you know, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4516.5s)]
*  French and US relationships with Algeria have been far more important, I think, than many people [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4522.82s)]
*  recognize because Algeria has such a strong sort of discourse of independence and autonomy, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4528.34s)]
*  of anti-colonialism, the whole legacy. And yet it's very clear that these subtle, sort of rather [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4534.5s)]
*  subtly presented relationships are actually very important for the ruling political order. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4540.9s)]
*  How do you see that going forward? I mean, where are we really today in Algeria? How much does the [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4547.94s)]
*  domestic dynamic, the regime survival we discussed earlier on, how tied into these foreign relationships [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4552.66s)]
*  is that? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4559.0599999999995s)]
*  Dalia, I think you're muted. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4570.18s)]
*  Sorry. When it comes, I was saying when it comes to the United States, there was a rapprochement [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4575.46s)]
*  between Algeria and the United States, you know, a remarkable one as a matter of fact since [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4581.54s)]
*  9-11 when the United States discovered that North African country that has been fighting between [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4587.14s)]
*  quotes terrorism for a decade and that has something of expertise and experience to offer. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4597.14s)]
*  And so there was a cooperation in the military security domain and it has been outstanding as [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4604.900000000001s)]
*  a matter of fact, especially that we are talking here about the country that one has one of the [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4611.46s)]
*  strongest military in the region after Egypt, but it is a country that has experience in the fight [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4616.58s)]
*  against terrorism. And hence the United States find that a lie in the Sahel. Let us remember here [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4625.3s)]
*  that the Sahel is a real quagmire for Algeria and for the region. And Algeria is sharing more than [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4632.98s)]
*  6,500 kilometers with seven other different countries. And it itself most of the time [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4640.74s)]
*  single-handed in the fight against terror. And so the American find this a lie that has experience, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4647.22s)]
*  that has knowledge and that is able or willing to a certain extent to cooperate. But again, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4653.86s)]
*  the last move of the last, I want to say disparate move of a president to Trump who clearly, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4661.94s)]
*  you know, is disparate of coup d'etat made towards a move against the [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4669.06s)]
*  the palisade of France and the Western Sahara is or might complicate this relationship. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4677.06s)]
*  Now the question, and I don't want to speculate here. I think we need to wait for to answer this [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4686.660000000001s)]
*  question once Biden will take office and we will see whether the administration of Biden will [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4693.86s)]
*  reverse the decision on Western Sahara or no. And then we can see what Algeria and how Algeria will [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4702.339999999999s)]
*  react. But again, this is not France. This is not the European Union. This, you know, is a cooperation [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4713.299999999999s)]
*  that is security and military. There isn't that much, you know, economic ties by comparison with [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4720.18s)]
*  Europe. And but one thing we ensure and one thing is in common between both Europe and the United [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4726.18s)]
*  States is the desire of both not to destabilize the North African Bahamuth that is Algeria. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4734.1s)]
*  And so I think that both are going, you know, to make efforts to make the [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4742.18s)]
*  statu quo endure as much as possible. And as you said it, and Michelle said it, when we have a [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4748.42s)]
*  president, the French president offering the legion d'honneur for a dictator like Cici, I doubt that [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4754.900000000001s)]
*  if, for instance, coercive measures are used in Algeria against peaceful process, France or [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4762.02s)]
*  Macron is going to have any reaction. Again, they have no interest whatsoever in destabilizing the [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4768.900000000001s)]
*  country and they want the regime to continue as long as possible. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4776.42s)]
*  Thanks, Dalia. I thought for a second there I'd lost you. So Morocco, I'd like to spend a few [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4786.26s)]
*  minutes on Morocco. I've not got into the domestic politics, but here's where I think [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4793.78s)]
*  we can look a little bit at, since Algeria is involved in this as well, all North Africa, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4801.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, the West Sahara thing, the reactivation of that conflict, and of course also the [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4807.3s)]
*  normalization of ties between Morocco and Israel. Again, another sort of Trump wild card [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4815.7s)]
*  potentially causing more trouble than benefits in terms of Algerian public opinion, for instance, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4823.86s)]
*  in terms of course clearly of more trouble in Western Sahara for Morocco, which isn't necessarily [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4830.099999999999s)]
*  good, and implications potentially for Morocco's wider foreign policy in Africa and elsewhere. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4835.0599999999995s)]
*  So, I mean, for me this is a bit of a jumble and I'm not sure what really is important in this [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4842.26s)]
*  picture and what is maybe just a distraction. Hamza, I'll come to you first if you could, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4848.18s)]
*  maybe Dalia very quickly afterwards, and then I'd like to have a couple of minutes for final [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4854.1s)]
*  comments in response to some of the comments we've received from our viewers. Hamza. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4858.66s)]
*  Well, I do think that it's an opportunistic move from Morocco. Actually, it seems like Morocco [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4863.78s)]
*  wanted or to gain a greater advantage in the Western Sahara conflict. I mean, the international [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4870.98s)]
*  community is so busy with the COVID and there is a sort of fatigue, I mean, among the international [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4877.7s)]
*  community on this long-running conflict. I mean, so, and I do think that Moroccan also, they saw [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4886.0199999999995s)]
*  in November after the skirmish between Moroccan, I mean, armed forces and the Polisario forces, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4896.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, at the Moroccan-Moritanian border that the support of the EU and France was not really a [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4904.26s)]
*  frank support, was not really warm support. They, I mean, the EU and France, they were cautious. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4913.22s)]
*  I mean, so I do think that they tried really to jump into and to take this, I mean, to play this [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4922.82s)]
*  Trump wild card and to get the support of Morocco on the issue of the Western Sahara, which is, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4932.82s)]
*  by the way, I mean, it's an important issue. It's important to recall that it's an important issue [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4942.42s)]
*  for the Moroccan regime, for the Moroccan kingdom, I mean, but also for a big part of [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4950.419999999999s)]
*  the Moroccan people. Really, this is a cause unifying the Moroccans at some point. And [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4956.58s)]
*  the fact or the support of many, many, many parties, like the Pejide, for example, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4966.98s)]
*  and many political parties for this move shows that the regime was not in fear of [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4972.1s)]
*  delegitimization at some point. So I do think that the move was opportunistic and based on the sort [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4980.42s)]
*  of calculation on what to lose and what to gain. And it's clear that the support of the US [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=4989.14s)]
*  administration, even if it's, I mean, this administration is leaving, it's about to leave, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5000.1s)]
*  was understood and perceived, is understood and perceived in Morocco like an important one to get [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5010.18s)]
*  to really strengthen its position on the Western Sahara conflict. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5017.9400000000005s)]
*  Dali would like to come in as well. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5023.7s)]
*  Yes, very quickly. I think, again, as I said, and I think we don't repeat it enough, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5027.7s)]
*  of course, the Moroccan kingdom has stake in this story, and it's been going on since the 70s, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5035.3s)]
*  and Algeria, but also Mauritania have a stake in this. But the first victim of this desperate move [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5040.98s)]
*  by a president who doesn't want to recognize that he lost are the Sahrawi people. And these [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5047.3s)]
*  are the first victims. And so they've been thrown under the bus, excuse my French, by a president [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5053.62s)]
*  who has a few days to go and who didn't know what to do to keep attention. And so the first victim, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5060.02s)]
*  again, are the Sahrawi people. Now, this is, of course, as you asked me, Yazid, whether [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5068.42s)]
*  the Algerian government reacted. Not really, but I guess no reaction is also a reaction. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5075.3s)]
*  I think the Algerian regime is waiting for Joe Biden to take over and then to see whether [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5080.26s)]
*  the decision would be reversed or no. And very quickly, for the Algerian people, there are two [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5085.54s)]
*  causes that are very sacred to their heart. The first one is the Palestinian cause, and the second [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5091.46s)]
*  one is the Western Sahara cause. So this is still a cause that interests many Algerians who are [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5097.0599999999995s)]
*  still standing with the Sahrawi for their desire for independence. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5103.78s)]
*  Many thanks. So now I'm going to come to everyone for final comments, if you've got anything to add, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5113.139999999999s)]
*  but I'm going to direct Michel and Hamza on two very specific comments we've had from our viewers. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5118.66s)]
*  Michel, the arrest and then release of the three members of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5124.82s)]
*  Rights recently, which caused a lot of international response, and Egyptian authorities seem to have [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5133.94s)]
*  retreated by releasing these three members rather sooner than some people expected. How do you read [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5140.82s)]
*  that? Does this tie into the whole expectation of testing the US administration of the Biden [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5149.54s)]
*  presidency? And Hamza, Tunisia started the Arab Spring. Any chance that if there are failed [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5155.46s)]
*  expectations once again in Tunisia, we're looking at another Arab Spring starting in Tunisia, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5164.34s)]
*  another uprising? Yazeed, on the question regarding the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5170.1s)]
*  activists, look, you know, we've seen some really confusing moves out of Egypt, you know, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5178.82s)]
*  releasing some people and then imprisoning these very, very prominent human rights activists who [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5184.42s)]
*  hadn't been taken before and then letting them go. And let me just say this. You know, the Egyptian [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5192.82s)]
*  regime under Sisi has been imprisoning a lot of people for, these are prisoners of conscience, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5200.02s)]
*  for their political views, for their work and human rights, civil society, media. It's one of [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5209.14s)]
*  the biggest jailers of journalists in the world. And some of them have been foreign citizens, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5214.34s)]
*  including American citizens or family members of Americans, especially Egyptian Americans who are [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5221.22s)]
*  active in civil society. So, you know, there's some of these arrests are about repression [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5228.02s)]
*  and sending signals within Egypt. And some of them seem to be frankly a form of hostage taking [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5235.700000000001s)]
*  that the Egyptian regime uses for bargaining. And I have to say that I really think that [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5241.620000000001s)]
*  there's increasing cynicism about this abroad and that really now in the US government and I imagine [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5248.820000000001s)]
*  in other governments like the government of France that has major problems with this, the [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5256.58s)]
*  government of Italy that's been trying to deal with the Giulia Reggiani killing, you know, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5259.94s)]
*  they're just getting really kind of sick of these tactics on the part of Sisi. So it'll be interesting [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5265.62s)]
*  to see if there will be a different approach. One thing I think there will be with the Biden [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5272.18s)]
*  administration, as one of our colleagues at Carnegie says, there's going to be an end to the [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5277.3s)]
*  values holiday of the Trump administration in foreign policy. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5282.9s)]
*  Thanks, Michelle. And Hamza, over to you immediately. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5289.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. Now, I do think that, yeah, the democratic settings and [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5292.259999999999s)]
*  democratic regimes or pluralistic settings are resilient. I mean, it's we can imagine [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5299.0599999999995s)]
*  a deep political crisis, we can imagine social unrest. But now, I'm surprising it's really not [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5306.9s)]
*  on the agenda or is not expected simply because the responsibility is collective. There is a [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5319.299999999999s)]
*  collective responsibility on the situation Tunisia is living today and going through today. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5326.099999999999s)]
*  And of course, I do think that we might see anticipated elections, we might see some political [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5333.62s)]
*  fixes or political maneuvers to try to really to address some of the claims and demands of the [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5343.3s)]
*  popular claims and demands. So we can expect probably maybe next year or the year after, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5354.42s)]
*  I mean, early elections, but not in case really of a deep and entrenched political and social crisis. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5361.54s)]
*  Thanks, Hamza. Now, I'm going to wrap up, unfortunately. I first want to sort of [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5372.0199999999995s)]
*  summarize looking forward at North Africa, and as for everywhere else in the world, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5380.98s)]
*  we're still not out of the COVID pandemic. And the social economic challenges and public finance [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5388.099999999999s)]
*  challenges facing all countries in North Africa are enormous and deepen existing problems that [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5396.18s)]
*  have been emerging over the past 20 years or so. And so clearly, governments throughout this region, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5403.94s)]
*  which already struggled to provide basic social services and economic investment, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5410.98s)]
*  and to stabilize their politics, therefore, and maintain their domestic coalitions, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5418.58s)]
*  all these governments are going to struggle even more post-COVID because definitely the long-term [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5424.5s)]
*  impacts on every possible level are going to be very, you know, are going to be long-term indeed. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5431.0599999999995s)]
*  And where we can't expect economic recovery and rebound that happens in, say, more advanced [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5437.38s)]
*  economies will not necessarily automatically translate into the same level of recovery [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5445.46s)]
*  or pace of recovery in North African countries. So the impact of where we're looking at post-COVID [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5450.9800000000005s)]
*  on pre-existing problems of governance and on armed conflict and on adventurism by regional [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5459.86s)]
*  and international powers in the North Africa sphere, clearly, this is something that still [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5467.06s)]
*  poses a huge challenge for governments and for local society. Now, in thanking everyone for taking [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5474.66s)]
*  part, to the panelists, to my colleagues, and to all those who took part in listening and sending [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5482.0199999999995s)]
*  us comments, I want to remind you that there's the final panel of this annual conference starts in, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5488.0199999999995s)]
*  I guess, just under half an hour. And this is on Lebanon in 2021, a year of existential challenges. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5494.26s)]
*  And for those of you who were with us the last 90 minutes or so, you had a demonstration of, [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5502.58s)]
*  you know, the little challenges people like Dahlia and I face with the power cuts [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5508.1s)]
*  two or three times during the course of this one panel. So please tune in in under half an [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5513.62s)]
*  hour for that final, final panel. Thanks again. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wefEYD-qcIU&t=5519.7s)]
