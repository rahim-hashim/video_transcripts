# Egypt Faces the Pandemic: Politics, Rights, and Global Dynamics
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [June 18, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20)
*  My name is Amr Hamzawi. I am a senior scholar at the Center on Democracy at Stanford University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=0.0s)]
*  and I work as a non-resident fellow at Carnegie at the Carnegie Endowment for International [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Peace. Let me welcome all of you to a panel discussion on Egypt faces a pandemic, a discussion [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=14.96s)]
*  on politics, rights, and global dynamics. We are privileged to have three excellent speakers, experts [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=22.2s)]
*  of Egypt, May El Saadani, who is the managing director of the Tahrir Institute in Washington, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  D.C., and an expert on legal issues. May has been writing a lot in recent years on Egyptian legal [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=41.32s)]
*  changes and questions of rights and freedoms in Egypt. Welcome, May, and thank you so much for [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=49.24s)]
*  joining us. We're privileged to have Khaled Mansour, an independent writer and a consultant [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=53.72s)]
*  on human rights issues. Welcome, Khaled. Glad to have you and great to see you. We're also [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=59.64s)]
*  privileged to have Michael Waheed Hanna. Michael is a senior fellow at the Century Foundation in New [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=67.16s)]
*  York, and Michael has been writing on Egyptian politics, following changes, events, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=73.72s)]
*  shifts in Egyptian politics throughout the last years. Michael, thank you so much for joining us [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=84.68s)]
*  and for having time to join us. Our discussion today is streamed to everyone. It's part of [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=89.16s)]
*  everyone who is interested, of course, in following the discussion. The recording will be available [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=98.84s)]
*  on the YouTube channel of the Carnegie Middle East Program. This panel discussion on Egypt faces a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=104.36s)]
*  pandemic, questions of politics, rights, and global dynamics is part of a series which began last week [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=111.32s)]
*  and which will extend to next week. Three panels. The first panel took place last week covering [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=119.32s)]
*  public health issues, public health challenges, and a third panel is taking place next week [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  to discuss how Egypt is facing the pandemic amid wider crises, be it the issue of water [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=132.76s)]
*  resources and the developments with regards to the Renaissance Dam in Ethiopia or different [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=142.44s)]
*  regional and international challenges which Egypt has been facing throughout the last years. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=148.44s)]
*  So that's what we're doing today. We're focusing on a discussion of state government responses [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=153.55999999999997s)]
*  to the pandemic impacts on politics, impacts on rights, and impacts on questions of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=163.56s)]
*  citizens' trust, civil society, and how civil society has been responding to the challenge of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=170.6s)]
*  the pandemic. If Mayan and Khaled agree, let me start by going to you, Michael, and asking you [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=176.84s)]
*  to share with us whether you see the pandemic has been having any impacts on Egyptian politics. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=183.72s)]
*  Of course, it's a short-term phenomenon so far as trying, as challenging as the pandemic may be. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=195.56s)]
*  It began to unfold a few months ago so we're clearly referring to short-term changes and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=202.84s)]
*  shifts, if any. So I would like to get your take on it. Are we seeing any critical changes? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=209.32s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me. Thanks for having this discussion. I think the big unknown, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=215.64000000000001s)]
*  and this is a variable the world over, is the course of the disease itself. It's hard to make [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=223.64000000000001s)]
*  firm predictions about what is going to happen when we really are still quite ignorant about [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=230.12s)]
*  transmission and the scale of outbreak. So it remains obviously a difficult proposition. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=237.8s)]
*  But we can see, I think, three distinct approaches, three phases to the response [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=246.04s)]
*  of the Egyptian government to the pandemic so far. I think it's interesting maybe just to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=252.44s)]
*  lay them out quickly. First, in February, when cases began to emerge in Egypt among tourists, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=260.12s)]
*  there was a quite defensive reaction by the regime. There was a widespread assumption [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=272.92s)]
*  because of past approaches to crises, which are generally focused on obfuscation, repression of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=277.96s)]
*  dissenting voices, that in fact the pandemic and the outbreak was happening in Egypt to a much [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=285.64s)]
*  greater degree. There's a lack of testing, a sense that the government was at that point prioritizing [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=294.52s)]
*  protection of the tourism sector as opposed to focusing on public health. We also saw at that [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  time the effect of expulsion of a foreign correspondent who was talking about the potential [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=310.12s)]
*  for much greater numbers. And so that early phase is characterized by this generalized [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=314.76s)]
*  and understandable suspicion of the Sisi regime based on past practice. And of course, it turned [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  out really that the pandemic and the outbreak itself was fairly contained at that early juncture. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=326.84s)]
*  This is the kind of thing that no authoritarian regime can simply hide. And obviously we're seeing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=333.8s)]
*  that now as we're in what I imagine is the kind of third phase of this progression. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=341.16s)]
*  The second phase coincided with outbreak within the senior ranks of the Sisi regime within the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=348.52000000000004s)]
*  security sector itself. And I think this was a great alarm for the regime. Publicly we saw [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  two senior generals pass away from the virus. And based on other conversations I've had, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=366.44s)]
*  I'm led to believe that the outbreak within the senior sectors of the regime was much, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  much wider than has been publicly reported so far. And obviously at that point, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=379.16s)]
*  something interesting happens, which is President Sisi basically disappears from public view for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=387.32s)]
*  several weeks. The prime minister steps forward. And as the government is starting to take this [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=392.28s)]
*  more seriously, the prime minister is really the face of Egyptian governance at that point, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  which breaks with really years long concentration of power within the office of the presidency. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=409.4s)]
*  So despite taking this more seriously, Egypt never went on full lockdown. It's not clear that [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=416.52000000000004s)]
*  that would have been advisable in any case. We're seeing this in many low income countries, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=423.72s)]
*  but balancing the costs of the economic pain of that kind of measure. But they seem to be taking [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=429.08000000000004s)]
*  it seriously, but there's no way to overcome decades of neglect of the public health sector [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=439.32000000000005s)]
*  in a matter of weeks. This is a fragile under-resourced sector. You cannot take [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=447.88000000000005s)]
*  steps to overcome that kind of neglect in a matter of weeks. And so the time bought by this kind of [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=454.36s)]
*  partial curfew, it's not clear that the government and the Egyptian regime did much with it to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=462.52s)]
*  prepare. And I think we're out of that second phase now. And I would just add that as the outbreak [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=470.04s)]
*  seemed tempered, there was a great deal of speculation about why this was the case. And [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=480.44s)]
*  this wasn't just Egypt. This was the case in many low income countries, a sense that perhaps [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=486.44s)]
*  demographics, climate, past vaccination regimes with TB and others maybe was producing a kind of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=491.32s)]
*  special or unique kinds of resilience in these kinds of countries that might make them less [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=500.28s)]
*  susceptible to the virus. And obviously that seems like a kind of senseless search for patterns that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=506.2s)]
*  probably don't exist. Which brings us now to this kind of current phase when clearly transmission [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=514.36s)]
*  is increasing. It's increasing at a kind of official level. We've had ministers saying that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=521.48s)]
*  the official numbers are likely an undercount. And interestingly, as it's taken a higher toll, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=526.52s)]
*  it has taken a higher toll on healthcare workers who have become increasingly vocal. And I think [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=535.48s)]
*  it is notable to see the doctor syndicate being quite critical in public. And [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=543.0s)]
*  there is a kind of rising alarm among the healthcare sector. And more broadly, particularly in [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=554.04s)]
*  Cairo, we hear things anecdotally, we read things beyond just the official numbers. It's clear that [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=560.92s)]
*  the health sector is under stress and is quite fragile. And in response to that stress, the CC [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=569.56s)]
*  regime has reverted to past practice. And we now see reports that physicians who have been trying [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=579.0s)]
*  to kind of ring the alarms and lack of preparation and protection afforded to healthcare workers [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=587.3199999999999s)]
*  have been detained. And so this is past practice. This is the approach of the regime to [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=593.64s)]
*  previous crises, to obfuscate what is happening, to suppress dissent. And I would just say that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=601.72s)]
*  it's not clear to me, and I'll end here, it's not clear to me that that approach is going to work [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=609.72s)]
*  in this case. This is an outbreak that is growing. We don't know if this is at its peak. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=616.6s)]
*  But what we do know is that it is a very serious specter for the country. And it is affecting [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=624.76s)]
*  people across class boundaries. This is not something that is focused on lower classes only. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=633.24s)]
*  In fact, at the initial stages, it seemed to be impacting those who actually travel [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=640.28s)]
*  more freely and more frequently. In any case, I am not sure that the CC regime [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=646.76s)]
*  faced with this kind of societal crisis that crosses class boundaries can simply repress away [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=654.76s)]
*  its opponents, who in many ways are not focused solely on the politics of the moment, per se. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=665.32s)]
*  All dissent is political in this context, but are really focused on the public health response. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=675.0s)]
*  And I think that's something that we will continue to see. One addendum here, and that is that [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=680.28s)]
*  there has not been a course correction in Egyptian politics since the coup, and there hasn't been a [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=690.2800000000001s)]
*  kind of return to any kind of normalcy. The ratchet only increases in one direction. We saw [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=700.2s)]
*  some internal reshuffling following the protests in the fall, clearly some internal friction at [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=708.2s)]
*  that time. And yet the outward-facing approach of the regime remains constant. We haven't seen [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=715.4799999999999s)]
*  any kind of major releases of detainees and prisoners. And so this really is the constant [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=722.68s)]
*  in terms of how the CC regime is approaching politics writ large and this crisis specifically. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=730.8399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you so much, Michael. So I am very, very interesting remarks. Before coming to you, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=739.0s)]
*  Mai, let me just highlight your reference, Michael, to past and new practices. So you're saying [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=746.36s)]
*  past practices are noticeable in the handling of the crisis, be it how the government is [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=756.4399999999999s)]
*  dealing with the syndicate of medical doctors, and that there are new elements, primarily the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=763.6400000000001s)]
*  front seats, which are taken by the cabinet, by technocratic members of the cabinet, the prime [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=770.6800000000001s)]
*  minister and other members of the cabinet. So we probably will come back to that and see whether [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=777.0s)]
*  it represents a shift within the executive branch of government in Egypt, within the system, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=781.4000000000001s)]
*  from the presidency to the cabinet. Does it tell us a bit more about balance or imbalance [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=786.2s)]
*  between civilians in the cabinet as opposed to representatives of military and security [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=791.16s)]
*  institutions? And whether we're seeing a bit of politics being reintroduced to Egyptian [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=797.0799999999999s)]
*  formal spaces via that contestation between the syndicate and the cabinet, because the government [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=805.16s)]
*  did not only detain some, but they made concessions of financial nature as well and increased levels [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=810.52s)]
*  of precautions, and there were grand announcements which were made by the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=817.32s)]
*  prime minister in recent days. But we'll come back to that later. Mai, if I can get your response to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=821.24s)]
*  a question which Michael touched upon, whether the pandemic is having impacts on the situation of [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=830.12s)]
*  freedom of expression of human rights in Egypt, there were some changes which were introduced to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=837.5600000000001s)]
*  the emergency law recently. There are different interpretations of what the changes mean. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=843.56s)]
*  I personally tend to see them as basically enabling the prime minister to decree measures. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=851.9599999999999s)]
*  Others tend to see them in a different way. So can I get your take on the impact of the pandemic [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=856.28s)]
*  short term, of course, on the rights and freedom situation in Egypt? Sure. Thank you, Amr, for [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=863.16s)]
*  moderating, and thank you, Carnegie, for hosting me. Before I answer your question, I just want to [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=869.88s)]
*  take a moment to mourn and send my condolences to the loved ones of the late Egyptian activist [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=875.08s)]
*  Sara Hegazi. In addition to the immense impact she had on the LGBT space, she was a strong voice on [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=880.12s)]
*  the rights issues that we'll be talking about today. To answer your question, though, from a [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=886.76s)]
*  rights perspective in Egypt, I will say COVID, I think, has done two primary things. It's given [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=892.84s)]
*  us a window into how authoritarian control has been consolidated for years now in Egypt, and it's [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=897.8s)]
*  shown us exactly how this authoritarian structure is leveraged in a moment of global emergency. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=904.4399999999999s)]
*  So in my opinion, it's not necessarily that we're seeing an immense amount of new legislation or [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=910.1999999999999s)]
*  creation of new policies in the rights space. These structures and the gaps have existed for [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=915.56s)]
*  years now. It's really that we're seeing how the system fails its population from a rights [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=920.52s)]
*  perspective on a much more massive scale. And I want to focus my answer on three primary political [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=925.88s)]
*  rights issues, and perhaps we can touch on some of the others later, but control of information, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=931.64s)]
*  due process, and emergency powers. In recent years, we've really seen a significant amount of [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=937.8s)]
*  legislation, prosecutions, attempt to control and really streamline the narrative, whether you're [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=943.8s)]
*  looking at the 2018 media and cybercrime laws, the spike in prosecutions for folks on false news [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=949.72s)]
*  charges, increasing state control of the media, or the continued crackdown on CSOs, academia, press, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=956.76s)]
*  anyone who's really producing information. At the same time in Egypt, you don't have a freedom of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  information legal structure or a way for citizens to learn what authorities are up to, unless the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=969.0s)]
*  authorities choose to share certain information. And so you can imagine that amid pandemic, at a [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=974.2s)]
*  time when information can actually help millions moderate their behavior and a swash panic, access [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  to information is particularly critical. I will say, of course, that Egyptian authorities, they [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=985.0s)]
*  have been reporting on numbers daily. They have been holding press conferences and they have set [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=989.6400000000001s)]
*  up websites and tools to provide information about the pandemic. And I don't want to get into right [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=994.36s)]
*  now the accuracy of numbers or issues of disinformation, because those are topics that [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=999.8s)]
*  could have their own panel, really. But I do want to hone in on the fact that when information has [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1004.3599999999999s)]
*  come out that doesn't fit into the narrative presented by the government, rather than respond [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1009.4s)]
*  or issue corrections, the government response has been heavy handed. And we saw this with the example [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  Michael pointed to, deporting a guardian journalist, covering alternate projections, rather than issuing [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1019.4799999999999s)]
*  a rebuttal, prohibiting all visits to prisons, rather than creating a safe virtual alternative [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1025.0s)]
*  for families to really check in on their loved ones and access information, arresting individuals [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1031.16s)]
*  who put out social media content on COVID, whether that's lawyers who might be engaging on what's [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1036.6s)]
*  happening among pretrial detainees or doctors who are documenting a lack of PPE. So switching gears [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1042.12s)]
*  a bit to due process in prisons, I would say, looking at what's been happening since 2013, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1049.32s)]
*  we've been seeing the access to justice become really more and more tenuous, because of a result [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1054.84s)]
*  of a number of things, but including legislation implicating the independence of the judiciary, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1059.8s)]
*  the rise of entities like the Supreme State Security Prosecution, and over reliance on [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1064.76s)]
*  pretrial detention as a measure. And this has really given us a detention system where prison [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1070.36s)]
*  facilities are overcrowded, detention renewals are sort of the norm, and there's been a spike [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1075.64s)]
*  accordingly because the system is so pressured, there's been a spike in access to inadequate [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1080.6000000000001s)]
*  medical care, deaths in detention. So you have this penal system that has evolved and that's [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1085.88s)]
*  developed that isn't really meant to reform behavior or make victims whole, but rather it's [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1092.1200000000001s)]
*  meant to punish for the sake of punishment. And I think during pandemic, we've seen just the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  challenges of how this system plays out and how these due process violations have been act. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1101.08s)]
*  So obviously, despite the immense amount of risk you can envision if COVID were to spread in [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1107.32s)]
*  Egyptian jails, and how this would threaten both the prison population and the population as a whole, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1111.96s)]
*  Egyptian authorities have dragged their feet when it comes to mass or temporary releases, even though [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1117.8s)]
*  that is the primary recommendation from the WHO when it comes to combating COVID in detention. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1123.32s)]
*  Despite the fact also that countries in the region have released folks in the thousands, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1130.2800000000002s)]
*  whether you're looking at Bahrain, Morocco, Iran, I could go on and on. And when Egypt finally did [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1134.68s)]
*  issue a pardon for prison releases, it was on the occasion of Sinai Liberation Day, there was zero [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1140.2800000000002s)]
*  mention of the pandemic, and of course, it carved out exceptions for political prisoners, protesters, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1146.76s)]
*  as we want to see. And so now we're in a place where we're actually starting to see reports on [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1151.88s)]
*  social media that there could be cases of COVID in a number of different jails. The problem is [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1156.84s)]
*  there's no way to verify those cases, which creates even more panic. And instead of responding or [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1161.9599999999998s)]
*  sharing maybe what they're doing to protect prisoners, authorities are refusing to engage [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  with family members, and they're not verifying or commenting on these claims, again, creating more [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1173.32s)]
*  panic in the process. And when we look at the court system, we've seen similar violations. When [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1178.12s)]
*  COVID hit, of course, court sessions were ultimately suspended for what became a two-month [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1183.16s)]
*  period. And so this meant that the many thousands of folks who were kept in pretrial detention [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1187.48s)]
*  were kept there illegally without review. And instead of authorities thinking to order [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1192.52s)]
*  temporary releases or to use that two-month period to set up virtual or video court sessions [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1197.48s)]
*  as other countries like the UAE, Tunisia have done, when courts did resume, what we saw is that [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1203.96s)]
*  renewals were conducted on paper without lawyers present, without detainees being transferred or [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1210.2s)]
*  brought before the court, again, furthering some of the root due process issues that we had been [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1215.32s)]
*  seeing for years now. And then finally, turning to your question about emergency powers, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1220.04s)]
*  Egypt watchers know that the country has had a long history, obviously, with the state of emergency. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1226.28s)]
*  And most recently, it's been already in an effectively continuous state of emergency [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1231.0800000000002s)]
*  since April 2017. And when the country is in this state, the provisions of the emergency law [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1235.88s)]
*  kick into effect, which can mean emergency court prosecutions, extended surveillance and monitoring, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1241.64s)]
*  ability to impose curfews. And out of all the rights issues I've flagged so far, I will say this [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1248.2s)]
*  is one of the few areas we've seen active legislating or the creation of new policies. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1253.0800000000002s)]
*  And we saw toward the end of April, Egypt's emergency law was in fact amended. Two big things [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1257.72s)]
*  I think to take away here. The first is that 18 new authorities were added to the president's mandate [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1263.32s)]
*  during a state of emergency from suspending schools to restricting public demonstrations, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1269.56s)]
*  to delaying the payment of gas bills. And the second thing is that the state of emergency [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1274.6s)]
*  expanded the role of the military prosecution in a way that could facilitate its involvement, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1279.3999999999999s)]
*  both in investigating and prosecuting crimes during the state of emergency. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1285.24s)]
*  We have yet to see exactly how this amended emergency law will apply. So I don't want to, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1289.64s)]
*  I don't want to guess. But I will say that there's certainly concern from a legal perspective, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1295.0s)]
*  both about expanding the powers of the military judicial system, because we have data that says [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1299.96s)]
*  it's a system that doesn't offer due process protections that would normally be afforded to [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1304.5200000000002s)]
*  citizens. And of course, on the 18 authorities added to the president's power, they may seem [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1309.0s)]
*  important in this moment of pandemic or necessary. The question though is that [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1314.84s)]
*  these authorities will continue to be in the emergency law forever unless amended. And so [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1319.24s)]
*  when that we have states of emergencies that arise out of different contexts, not health related, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1324.52s)]
*  query if these powers are going to be necessary and proportionate as they should. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1329.72s)]
*  So to sum up and answering your question, you have a rights context where Egypt is not necessarily [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1334.28s)]
*  new mechanisms implicating rights, but rather existing and rely on its infrastructure, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1340.36s)]
*  its existing infrastructure. And it's just that now we're seeing the extent to which this [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1345.6399999999999s)]
*  infrastructure can be used and how it's affecting, I would say, a much larger chunk of the population. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1349.8799999999999s)]
*  I'll stop here and I look forward to the rest of the discussion. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1356.28s)]
*  Okay, thank you, Mai, so much. Let me move to you, Khaled, and thank you so much for your patience. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1360.28s)]
*  So Khaled, you've been working with and on civil society in Egypt for several years now, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1367.24s)]
*  and you've been following developments with regard to freedom of expression in Egypt. So I [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1374.76s)]
*  would love to get your input as well on whether a pandemic and state responses, government responses [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1380.44s)]
*  to the pandemic are impacting changes with regard to freedom of expression and with regard to what [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1387.48s)]
*  civil society, civil society organizations have been able to do in Egypt since the outbreak [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1392.6s)]
*  in January, February 2020. Thank you very much, Amr, thank you for having me. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1401.32s)]
*  As you rightly said at the beginning, this is such a short period of time, but despite the fact that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1407.72s)]
*  we have unprecedented conditions globally speaking, I think we have precedented behavior [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1415.16s)]
*  by the government or really accentuated or heightened trends that we have seen over many years [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1422.8400000000001s)]
*  of authoritarianism, unaccountable and sometimes inexplicable, repressive policies that you don't [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1431.3200000000002s)]
*  know what would be the objective or the value of having them, but also to have one positive [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1437.8000000000002s)]
*  aspect in an otherwise bleak picture, but again it's also maybe because of them we have had some [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1445.24s)]
*  vibrant and active civil society moves, especially in service provisions, and it's because of them [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1454.8400000000001s)]
*  largely because since the state services are declining and since state policies are causing [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1462.92s)]
*  much poverty, then civil society has really stepped up to fill in a lot of gaps. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1469.72s)]
*  Now also probably some of the negative trends that my co-panelists have spoken about [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1477.3200000000002s)]
*  have increased since people or stakeholders domestically or [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1486.28s)]
*  outside the country are busy worrying about their lives and the lives of loved ones and their people [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1493.8000000000002s)]
*  and their constituencies that they wouldn't engage even in a social media campaign against [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1498.92s)]
*  human rights violations that much. So hunger strikes for example don't generate a lot of domestic or [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1503.8000000000002s)]
*  foreign interest as they used to do. Now in terms of freedom of expression, the problem is with [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1514.1200000000001s)]
*  COVID-19 that at so far one cannot write freely without the risk of having a legal backlash [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1523.56s)]
*  even on social media platforms. So Facebook posts have taken a few people to prison on serious [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1534.2s)]
*  charges. Several journalists, at least three, have been arrested after they wrote critically about [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1540.6s)]
*  COVID-19 and government policies. At least five doctors who have suppressed their views [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1546.9199999999998s)]
*  on professional issues or professional concerns or critical state policies were also arrested. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1553.8s)]
*  So in a way social media, which is the only remaining platform for people to articulate [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1561.1599999999999s)]
*  their positions or their views, have become a sort of a trap including platforms such as [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1566.12s)]
*  TikTok. And as we see in pandemics or such huge public health emergencies, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1572.2s)]
*  the moralistic and conservative wing usually gains traction. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1579.96s)]
*  And we know about a couple of women who have been arrested for undermining family values with their [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1586.76s)]
*  videos and it's not only Trump who's holding the Bible in front of the White House. I mean you've [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1592.76s)]
*  seen a lot of at least on social media public backlash, conservative and what have you. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1597.72s)]
*  Now the problem with curtailing freedom of expression is that in a country where politics [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1605.4s)]
*  is eviscerated, at least formal politics is really empty, the arena, and in a country where the [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1612.68s)]
*  mass media is largely controlled by government or pro-government [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1621.72s)]
*  interests, people are one, kept in the dark about what's really happening and two, government doesn't [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1629.32s)]
*  have much of a feedback about their performance and what they are doing. Three, mistakes are covered [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1638.36s)]
*  up or uncovered. So if you have about 73 doctors according to the last count [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1643.56s)]
*  that died because of COVID-19, which is many folds, the percentage you have in countries that have been [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1652.6799999999998s)]
*  suffering much higher numbers of infections like Italy, it's like maybe four or five times more [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1659.0s)]
*  than Italy, then there is a serious issue. But if you have doctors arrested because they speak about [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1667.0s)]
*  personal protective equipment, then you do have an issue because you will never know as a [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1672.44s)]
*  policymaker if you would like to know what's really happening on the ground. And with the absence of [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1677.08s)]
*  an energetic or engaged parliament in general, social media has become probably the only space [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1685.88s)]
*  that people can resolve to so they can discuss life and death matters and voice their concerns, needs [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1692.68s)]
*  and criticism. But instead of working with people trying to respond to some of these, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1700.3600000000001s)]
*  then we have either state or pro-government voices even in campaigns rehashing the old stuff about [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1709.0800000000002s)]
*  the problem is people are ignorant, people are not wearing masks as if all people with a country of [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1718.1200000000001s)]
*  33% poverty rate can afford all these medical measures or people are not socially isolating or [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1724.52s)]
*  taking business with each other as those voices tend to forget how densely populated some of the [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1730.6s)]
*  neighborhood that sometimes it's better to socially isolate yourself in the street rather than back [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  back at home. I mean at the end of the day policies seem to be for an outsider very opaque and [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1743.0s)]
*  whimsical. They are decided or shaped by the prerogatives or the needs of social control [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1752.1999999999998s)]
*  without a recourse for the people who suffer most. I mean who is talking on behalf of the poor or the [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1758.04s)]
*  patients or the doctors or the medical staff and getting a listening ear from the government or [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1764.4399999999998s)]
*  the state side. Now we have seen from the very varied policies around the globe to address the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1771.56s)]
*  pandemic from open Sweden to totally under a few countries like like Jordan that there's no one [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1780.92s)]
*  scientific way to handle to handle this pandemic that that that public health policies are ultimately [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1789.64s)]
*  political and you cannot have politics without having people speaking about about about the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1796.8400000000001s)]
*  views. So in Egypt as in all other countries decisions were taken for example on how to [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1804.6s)]
*  assign limited medical resources, how to balance the economic losses with public health needs, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1812.12s)]
*  who pays the price, what about the poor. I mean all these decisions are ultimately political not [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1817.8799999999999s)]
*  scientific only medical and definitely not to be decided by one minister or one president. So I [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1823.48s)]
*  think my main concern about the crackdown on freedom of expression that it does deprive people [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1832.52s)]
*  from a channel towards the concerns. It does deprive the government from a way to understand [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1839.4s)]
*  better what's happening on the ground and that's why nobody really understands [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1843.64s)]
*  what's what's happening. Anecdotally you hear horror stories in terms of numbers. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1848.52s)]
*  So I had it we're we're not able to hear you. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1853.64s)]
*  Can you hear me now? Yes please so if you if you do not mind repeating I suspect the last two [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1871.5600000000002s)]
*  sentences. I mean basically I was trying to I was trying to stress why freedom of information [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1877.16s)]
*  and expression is really important for policymakers, for politics, for policy formation [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1883.96s)]
*  and for people to regain some trust in a government that they have lost all confidence in. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1889.96s)]
*  Okay great thank you so much Khaled. So let me let me before coming [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1899.0s)]
*  I'm coming to to you Michael in in the second round of [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1903.72s)]
*  conversation among you panelists let me remind everyone who is following us that they can raise [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1911.0s)]
*  questions. They can send written questions which I will receive and direct to our panelists today. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1918.2s)]
*  I will try to bundle questions as a moderator and pass them to to our panelists for [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1927.64s)]
*  responses, input, comments. Michael let me let me push you a bit more on sort of that duality of [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1936.6s)]
*  past and new elements in in government in the government response in Egypt to to the pandemic [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1945.88s)]
*  and so if you if you would compare the current crisis and the pandemic does represent a crisis [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1955.96s)]
*  not only a public health crisis as Khaled was mentioning it's an economic it's a social it's a [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1961.8000000000002s)]
*  public health issue it's ultimately a political crisis as well so when you compare the government [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1966.44s)]
*  handling of the current crisis to previous crises since 2013 be it for example the ongoing crisis [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1972.1200000000001s)]
*  of the Renaissance Dam in Ethiopia and the handling of it or the two island deal [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1979.48s)]
*  between Egypt and Saudi Arabia or the government did have a contentious relationship with the [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1986.52s)]
*  syndicate of medical doctors and the syndicate of journalists in 2015 and 16 so there were [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=1996.6s)]
*  different crises which were challenging for the political system in Egypt. Are you seeing when [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2002.6799999999998s)]
*  you compare the handling of the current crisis to previous crises are you seeing if even a slight [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2010.36s)]
*  shift toward more transparency is the nature of the current crisis imposing a higher level of [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2015.56s)]
*  transparency and I'm referring to what Maggie was saying regarding the daily press conferences [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2022.6s)]
*  issuing daily statements primary by the cabinet by the prime minister and relevant ministers so [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2028.2s)]
*  secondly when I look at them and the balance or division of labor between the presidency and the [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2034.68s)]
*  cabinet are you seeing shifts as well it's not only about the presidency taking a back seat or [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2041.0800000000002s)]
*  not shaping the state response from a front seat but the cabinet is using even the emergency powers [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2047.8s)]
*  which Maggie was referring to I mean these powers have been used once and again by the prime minister [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2059.32s)]
*  to decree measures all the way from curfew regulations into closure of schools and universities [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2063.8s)]
*  and so on and so forth are we seeing a bit of a different division of labor than the one which [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2069.56s)]
*  we've been seeing since 2015 is the cabinet empowered our civilian voices and ministers [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2073.48s)]
*  in the cabinet empowered how do you see that yeah I mean I think I would start with the the discussion [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2078.52s)]
*  about transparency and I go back to other contexts right so not just Egypt we looked at the first if [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2085.32s)]
*  we look at the first country in the region that suffered a mass outbreak Iran also a quite [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2096.52s)]
*  authoritarian context and similarly an effort to give some sense of the scope of disease [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2103.4s)]
*  in the country and I go back to an earlier comment I don't think that disease amidst a pandemic can [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2113.16s)]
*  be hidden right so I don't think this is a function of choice that there is a knowing shift [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2122.44s)]
*  toward transparency I think this is a function of necessity you cannot hide these numbers and [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2131.8s)]
*  obviously these numbers are for a variety of reasons mostly having to do with testing capacity [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2140.6s)]
*  that are not unique to Egypt these numbers are an undercount and if you have people in cities [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2147.2400000000002s)]
*  and villages who can't have their loved ones loved ones admitted to a hospital if you have a young [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2156.52s)]
*  doctor with covid who dies in his own home because his family can't find an icu bed for him again [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2164.04s)]
*  it's too widespread it is it is not just an Egypt story it is a global story [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2173.7999999999997s)]
*  and it is affecting people throughout the society so you know I don't think that this reflects a [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2180.68s)]
*  kind of conscious choice towards greater transparency I think this is a function of [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2187.48s)]
*  necessity they they have no other option but to at least try to communicate some information about [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2193.0s)]
*  the state of the disease in the country and I think that this this function of necessity [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2200.84s)]
*  flows into your your second question about division of labor you know I think there are [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2207.6400000000003s)]
*  real questions about the kind of initial move to the forefront of the prime minister it came at a [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2213.4s)]
*  time when when president cc effectively disappeared from public life in a very conspicuous way that [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2221.8s)]
*  produced a great deal of speculation as to why and I think you know understandably so [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2228.44s)]
*  you know but it also reflects the fact that there are there has been such great concentration of [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2238.68s)]
*  power and focus on cc and the office of the presidency that when he disappears from public [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2244.92s)]
*  life it's it's not immediately clear other than the prime minister who could possibly step forward [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2251.0s)]
*  to kind of fill that void but obviously the prime minister did take a much more public role [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2256.84s)]
*  the minister of health has been a much more public voice and again I do think this is a function of [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2264.52s)]
*  necessity these are not things that I think that the office of the presidency is well equipped to [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2272.84s)]
*  deal with I don't necessarily think that they represent a at the moment a major shift in a kind [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2279.0s)]
*  of approach to governance but what I would say is that they might have a real impact on the balance [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2287.96s)]
*  of powers depending on how this crisis unfolds particularly in terms of length if this becomes [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2297.88s)]
*  a crisis that that lasts months and years and we see other parts of the government taking on [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2305.7999999999997s)]
*  a more public role I think it is very possible that it has some impact again out of necessity [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2313.16s)]
*  you know but I don't think that we're seeing a kind of conscious decision on the part of the [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2321.7999999999997s)]
*  office of the presidency and cc himself to really remake the way that government functions in Egypt [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2326.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2333.56s)]
*  Thank you Michael so much. So you mentioned in your reference to the rights to the human [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2337.72s)]
*  rights situation in Egypt you mentioned that Egypt has not the government in Egypt has not been [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2348.12s)]
*  legislating or issuing or passing new laws but it's been primarily [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2355.56s)]
*  it's been primarily using existing laws to in terms of its management of the pandemic [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2361.16s)]
*  as it pertains to freedom of expression and as it pertains to questions of human rights. To what [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2372.6s)]
*  extent do you see Egypt fitting in a wider global setting I mean is Egypt any different from [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2378.8399999999997s)]
*  undemocratic countries be it all the way from Hungary and Europe to different cases in Asia, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2385.48s)]
*  Africa and Latin America. Are we looking at an Egyptian specificity or are we simply looking at [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2393.88s)]
*  how undemocratic governments normally respond in moments of crises to social economic [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2402.2000000000003s)]
*  public health challenges? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2410.84s)]
*  Thank you. Honestly I would say it's a bit of both because you're seeing Egypt it's obviously not [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2415.7200000000003s)]
*  unusual that authoritarian governments would already have laws for tailing protest, freedom [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2422.0400000000004s)]
*  of expression, poor freedom of information laws but Egypt is I would say ahead of the curve on [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2427.0800000000004s)]
*  some of this legislation. It has multiple laws that you can use to crack down on false news charges [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2433.2400000000002s)]
*  for example it has multiple laws to silence particular organizing and activities so I think [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2439.56s)]
*  in as much as that can be that is different there's more of a there's more tools in the [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2444.92s)]
*  toolbox even if they're being achieved towards the same purpose. Other countries in the region have [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2449.88s)]
*  similar legislation but it may be is not be had not been widely exercised and used I think to [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2455.48s)]
*  the degree that we had been seeing in Egypt particularly in the last few years and I would [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2461.64s)]
*  say I'll give you not necessarily in the legislation space but I'll give you again I strike the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2466.36s)]
*  example of Egypt comparing Egypt to other countries in the MENA region. Even authoritarian [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2471.4s)]
*  governments in the MENA region including Iran released tens of thousands of prisoners in the [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2478.36s)]
*  wake of COVID because they recognized the severity of the health crisis at hand. Egypt on the other [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2483.88s)]
*  hand did not take action and in fact we were tracking this and there are tens of countries [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2490.36s)]
*  in the region that had issued by that time by the time Egypt finally engaged on this issue [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2496.28s)]
*  thousands of releases and so I think there's there's this slowing down and dragging of its [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2501.48s)]
*  feet that you're seeing that is a little bit unique to the Egyptian context and I think I think that's [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2506.76s)]
*  important to note and similarly again in the example that I pointed to with the court sessions [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2512.76s)]
*  the fact is that even authoritarian governments or governments in the region with authoritarian [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2518.04s)]
*  tendencies were able to transition to virtual court sessions because they recognized the need [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2522.52s)]
*  to hear trials if you will. Egypt did not it took a two-month period sitting on its feet effectively [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2529.32s)]
*  and not coming up with an alternative response so I think while you did see like Michael had been [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2537.56s)]
*  saying is sort of it's not a conscious choice and I very much agree with that but out of necessity [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2543.32s)]
*  the areas where I think Egypt has felt that it doesn't need to make changes have been particularly [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2548.76s)]
*  underscored in the prison spaces where I think there is still an understanding that we don't [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2555.48s)]
*  need to act or we don't need to provide transparency in this space because it's still in their [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2559.6400000000003s)]
*  assessment a marginal or a niche issue similarly with the court and judicial system. It's kind of [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2564.92s)]
*  using the little bit of it's using the attention that you might that you might be getting on the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2570.2s)]
*  health economic issues the issues that are often viewed as more pressing and maybe providing little [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2576.52s)]
*  wins here and there or or being a little bit more proactive but it's very much kind of flowing its [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2582.44s)]
*  feet and not recognizing how the political rights might be related to the economic and health and [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2587.72s)]
*  they certainly are. Right so thank you thank you Maya in fact there are a few indications from [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2592.84s)]
*  from the cabinet that they do look at the public health challenge represented by the pandemic not [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2601.96s)]
*  separately or not in a separated fashion from the social and economic challenges so the cabinet the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2608.6800000000003s)]
*  prime minister established a working group which is in a way very similar to the division of labor [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2615.32s)]
*  between the presidency and the prime minister. They established it's like a return to pre-2011 [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2619.96s)]
*  Egypt to the last years under former president Mubarak the interplay between the Naseef [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2625.7200000000003s)]
*  Ahmad Naseef government and the presidency back then the prime minister established an interesting [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2630.76s)]
*  working group where he has different ministers represented represented as a private sector and [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2635.96s)]
*  a few NGOs to look at the social and economic impact of the pandemic and that working group is [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2644.28s)]
*  meeting if I'm not mistaken every two weeks in the prime minister's office and in a way it's a [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2649.56s)]
*  return to what the Egyptian government does know or did knew before 2011 as well since of a limited [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2654.12s)]
*  not only staged but limited engagement with civil society and with that I go to you Khaled because [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2661.4s)]
*  you said that maybe one of the positive outcomes so far of the handling of the pandemic is the [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2665.96s)]
*  role of civil society. I was before coming to the panel I was reading looking at two sets of surveys [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2672.68s)]
*  public opinion surveys one conducted by the Princeton project the Arab barometer and a [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2680.04s)]
*  second one conducted by Markaz Basira which is a local center for public opinion in Egypt and in [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2686.6s)]
*  the two sets regarding Egypt and regarding trust of citizens in government institutions as opposed [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2694.12s)]
*  to civil society up until January 2020 February 2020 the government and government institutions [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2699.48s)]
*  have been scoring relatively way not only relatively actually way better than civil society [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2705.88s)]
*  institutions the government in the Arab the Egyptian government handling of different crises [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2711.32s)]
*  different challenges according to the Arab barometer has been positively rated up to 70 [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2716.84s)]
*  68 69 percent in Basira up to 80 percent in specific sectors electricity oil petroleum what [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2723.48s)]
*  have you and civil society is down in in in in recent surveys and polls to maybe in terms of [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2731.56s)]
*  trust citizens trust to less than 10 percent now you said that you you see it as a positive trend [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2739.08s)]
*  that civil society is engaging can you reflect a bit more of that what is civil society doing [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2744.3599999999997s)]
*  and how can how can it operate in an environment as tight as the Egyptian environment for civil [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2749.24s)]
*  society organizations um thank you since since i've been close to some of these [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2753.7999999999997s)]
*  surveys and how how they conducted it makes a huge difference to ask somebody in Egypt about [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2760.12s)]
*  non-governmental organizations which is has been really vilified and compared to the devil or [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2765.72s)]
*  civil society organizations or charity organizations all of which are actually [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2774.12s)]
*  maybe have the same legal form or various legal forms but engage in the same thing i mean the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2779.3199999999997s)]
*  main difference is between service provision organizations which i i i think if they are [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2784.68s)]
*  asked about it it will show a different numbers from advocacy organizations which are very few [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2791.64s)]
*  and they have been under tremendous pressure either in human rights or any other any other [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2798.6s)]
*  policy advocacy issues so that's one important point to keep to keep in mind running surveys [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2803.24s)]
*  which are by low criminalized if you don't have a large number of approvals endorsements including [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2812.52s)]
*  an endorsement for your own survey questions one after the other and engaging with a government [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2820.68s)]
*  body to do that are to say the least a bit dubious exercise to trust the results having said that [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2826.84s)]
*  a lot of what we discussed me and my and and and maybe michael is about the lack of information [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2836.2000000000003s)]
*  real information in the function of freedom of exchange of information and not because of [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2841.0s)]
*  necessity um you don't you don't you don't really have that so we lean and we count on anecdotal [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2846.2000000000003s)]
*  evidence based on our long experience of having engaged with civil society or talking to families [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2855.32s)]
*  or talking to a large number of people to understand who is helping whom i can tell you that an [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2860.84s)]
*  organization like mersal for example that was little known before this pandemic is the first [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2865.96s)]
*  name that comes to mind in all social media if you do a search of an organization that egyptians [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2872.44s)]
*  will donate to or they donated to to help victims of uh covered covered 19 many other organizations [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2877.56s)]
*  i spoke to in the last two three weeks i've spoken about how the the ministry of social solidarity [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2884.92s)]
*  has become not really relaxed because the law is really ambiguous and and and vague but they have [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2890.76s)]
*  become less obstructionist if you like especially when it comes again to charity or service provision [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2898.28s)]
*  by by civil society organizations the fact that people are helping each other even without [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2904.92s)]
*  organizations so you have groups and networks of people in villages raising funds or donating to [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2909.88s)]
*  people who are not working i mean that the issue we did not talk about in in in decision so far [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2916.76s)]
*  is the huge economic suffering of maybe a third of the population i just edited a report about [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2924.04s)]
*  poor single women in islam's in caro and how they are faring under the pandemic it's horrendous [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2933.0800000000004s)]
*  what's happening to them not only violence at home and and extreme poverty and resorting to [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2939.56s)]
*  discrete measures and these have only one recourse which is public solidarity and civil society [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2945.4s)]
*  organizations great thank you so much khaled so thank you thank you may michael and khaled for [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2953.08s)]
*  your remarks and we've been receiving questions from [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2963.72s)]
*  from your viewers and i would like to pass some questions to you depending on [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2972.2s)]
*  what i see you you're interested in responding to but please anyone feel free to jump in [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2982.8399999999997s)]
*  even if i'm directing a question to my michael and khaled please jump in if you if you would like to [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2989.4s)]
*  share your your insight so most of the questions we received so far are more or less directed to [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=2993.88s)]
*  your remarks michael in the sense of trying to better understand the dynamics between the [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3001.96s)]
*  government on the one hand and the syndicate of medical doctors and whether we are looking at [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3009.2400000000002s)]
*  a new pattern an emerging pattern of contestation or dissent or whether it's basically a [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3014.92s)]
*  confirmation of what we've been seeing since 2013 some groups which are which do represent [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3023.0800000000004s)]
*  collective interest be it the syndicate of medical doctors or the journalist syndicate or others [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3028.6800000000003s)]
*  would try to push for their own members interests i mean they are not addressing [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3035.4s)]
*  wider political issues it's as you said it's about protection of medical doctors and medical teams [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3041.96s)]
*  while performing their duties which all egyptians and all human beings actually appreciate or have [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3047.0s)]
*  come to appreciate even more since the pandemic began so is it is it that we're seeing the [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3053.0s)]
*  government using its traditional mixture of repression and co-optation or do you see a new [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3059.96s)]
*  pattern of contestation emerging is it too early to say so or what exactly is your take on it [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3067.32s)]
*  and the second question related to your remarks as well michael is on [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3074.1200000000003s)]
*  whether the absence of the presidency which you were referring to is related to a calculation on [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3080.04s)]
*  the side of the institution of the presidency that the presidency should let the cabinet tackle and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3087.48s)]
*  handle the state response to to the pandemic and basically keep a space for itself the presidency [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3095.32s)]
*  should keep a space for itself to basically interfere whenever needed to inject more trust [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3102.44s)]
*  in what the cabinet doing or what the government is doing when needed which is once again and here [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3108.36s)]
*  is a sentence from me which is once again can be seen elsewhere it can be seen in russia it can be [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3112.84s)]
*  seen in different other countries like across the globe so michael and khaled and my please feel free [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3117.88s)]
*  to jump in to comment on that too yeah i mean they're great questions and on on the first of [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3122.84s)]
*  whether we're seeing a new pattern of contestation you know i think since 2011 and particularly since [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3131.1600000000003s)]
*  2013 we we want to we oftentimes analytically fall into the trap of wanting to see the kind of [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3139.48s)]
*  big explosive change the kind of moment of political rupture when everything changes [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3150.12s)]
*  because you know we saw it once it failed in many ways and the present reality is is a quite grim [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3154.7599999999998s)]
*  and incrementally deteriorating one and so there's often the urge at each juncture [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3165.08s)]
*  to try to read and analytically in terms of the beginning of political change that this somehow [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3173.24s)]
*  turns a new chapter we saw this very clearly in the protests in the fall when i think some analysis [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3180.12s)]
*  really got too far out ahead of what was happening on the ground that being said i do think that this [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3186.04s)]
*  this crisis is different because it is not just a public health crisis it is a global public health [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3194.2s)]
*  crisis it is an economic crisis it is a social crisis and it's not one that is necessarily of [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3201.08s)]
*  of short duration this isn't the islands where you have several days of protests that simply evaporate [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3209.0s)]
*  over time and so the circumstance is different now whether this contestation produces a kind of [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3214.2s)]
*  different politics i think you know depends on what happens with the disease what happens with [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3222.68s)]
*  what happens with the the rate of transmission in egypt how uh how affected is egyptian society [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3230.8399999999997s)]
*  i mean i think we have to leave open the possibility that that uh that things can get worse [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3239.24s)]
*  without creating political openings uh that you know the the the dramatic uh negative reversals [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3245.96s)]
*  and and the creation of disaffection don't necessarily automatically translate into [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3255.16s)]
*  positive political change it is not clear what kind of political vehicle could collectivize [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3260.12s)]
*  that kind of disaffection to produce political change because formal political space in the [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3267.08s)]
*  terms of in terms of political parties and opposition press have been destroyed and so [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3273.3999999999996s)]
*  that's not something that can be recreated overnight but i do think it's worth considering [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3282.04s)]
*  how these can have an impact that that uh that has a kind of longer term impact the kind of creation [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3289.8s)]
*  of spaces in which the government uh is unable to simply crush dissent and opposition [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3299.0s)]
*  because this is a little different because this is a public health crisis because it is impacting [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3306.6s)]
*  doctors and because it is impacting people across uh class boundaries and so you know i do think [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3311.08s)]
*  it's worth considering uh whether this creates a kind of not protected space but a space in which [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3318.68s)]
*  the regime cannot simply uh imprison its way out of out of this kind of crisis um and and in terms [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3325.4s)]
*  of the second question uh whether this is a calculated step on the part of the president [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3332.7599999999998s)]
*  to let the prime minister and the cabinet take the reins as a way to perhaps distance uh distance [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3340.12s)]
*  the presidency from potential failure to create space and to in some ways shirk responsibility [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3346.6800000000003s)]
*  i would say i'm not sure because i'm not totally sure why this initial shift happened in march [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3355.88s)]
*  um whether this was a function of necessity um you know the and this goes back to the reasons [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3365.24s)]
*  for cc's disappearance from public life um and so you know depending on why that decision was taken [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3372.9199999999996s)]
*  i think it leads to very very different uh conclusions and so i would say i'm not sure [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3380.2799999999997s)]
*  i think regardless of the initial um the initial um motivation for the retreat from public life [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3387.0s)]
*  for several weeks i do think it has had that effect um that it has created another uh not center of [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3395.8s)]
*  authority but at least another uh authority figure um who is active on the public stage [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3403.32s)]
*  alongside other uh cabinet ministers and that is new and so whether the initial motivations were [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3410.04s)]
*  a function of necessity or a kind of calculated approach to try to at least shift the possibilities [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3417.64s)]
*  for blame i do think particularly if the duration of the of this kind of assumption of this role [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3424.2799999999997s)]
*  is uh one that that lasts quite a long time i think it it will have uh impact in terms of how [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3433.0s)]
*  how egypt governs itself right thank you michael and probably as political scientists we should [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3441.96s)]
*  be less preoccupied with motivations and intentions and more preoccupied with impacts and and so [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3447.8s)]
*  operational realities daily realities and so i uh yeah i mean i'm i'm i'm i'm restricting myself [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3453.96s)]
*  to my role as a moderator so i'm not interfering but i'm just commanding you for that remark on no [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3460.36s)]
*  matter what the intention is it's important to keep an eye on what the impact is and what the [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3465.6400000000003s)]
*  impact might be khaled and may do you like to jump in on on and add we we've we meanwhile we've [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3471.08s)]
*  received additional questions so but please feel free to jump in if you like to i have um one quick [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3477.6400000000003s)]
*  thing i just want to underscore something that michael said about um this not necessarily um [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3484.2799999999997s)]
*  being entirely different but but that we are seeing this stress on on the economy on health [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3491.64s)]
*  on people's on a larger part of the population and i think it's important to remember that [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3496.9199999999996s)]
*  one of the reasons that authoritarianism has manifested or lasted as long as it has in egypt [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3501.72s)]
*  is because traditionally it maybe has directly affected a smaller subset of the population [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3506.8399999999997s)]
*  and what's slightly different now is that more and more people are being affected or [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3511.88s)]
*  interacting more regularly in a life or death matter with the failures of the state and i think [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3515.88s)]
*  that's one important thing to keep in mind as well as the fact that more and more people are sitting [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3521.0s)]
*  at home whether it's all day or or in the evenings according to the curfew and watching the government's [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3527.0s)]
*  every move and so you have a population that is for the first time kind of paying attention in a [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3532.6s)]
*  massive degree and assessing measures that are working and measures that aren't and i don't know [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3537.64s)]
*  how it will manifest similar to michael but what i can say is that these two things are different [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3542.68s)]
*  and that a larger part portion of the population is being affected and a larger portion of the [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3547.72s)]
*  population is paying attention so like michael says i definitely agree it's not something that [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3552.04s)]
*  necessarily you can imprison or legislate away [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3556.7599999999998s)]
*  okay [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3559.64s)]
*  and if i may thank you michael please go ahead we really haven't seen the whole the full economic [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3563.64s)]
*  impact of what happened in the in the in the country i mean we are already we already [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3569.64s)]
*  sold like seven billion dollars of extra debt from the international monetary funds [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3578.04s)]
*  the foreign debt markets or the bond markets are not as easy to tap as they used to be in the past [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3582.7599999999998s)]
*  three years the energy prices are not going up so our gas income the promised one might not [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3587.8s)]
*  materialize soon and the most important the remittances the 26 billion dollars that were [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3593.48s)]
*  sent to egypt last year by people working overseas will decline they will decline there's no way [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3598.2000000000003s)]
*  around it i think we are entering tough times economically and people might pay and i'm not [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3604.04s)]
*  sure but i think people will pay maybe less attention to public health than than they do [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3614.84s)]
*  to their pockets and their livelihood which is becoming more and more difficult for their [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3620.92s)]
*  middle classes in egypt thank you thank you on on on that last point and and coming back or [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3624.92s)]
*  staying with you so we have a question on the impact of egypt's need for an economic economic [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3633.88s)]
*  and financial for external financing the potential impacts of egypt's strong need for [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3643.16s)]
*  external financing on egypt's foreign relationships i mean do you and of course [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3650.92s)]
*  michael and may please come in if you if you like to how did you expect egypt to continue its close [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3656.7599999999998s)]
*  relationship with the gulf even if the gulf or some gulf countries can no longer provide that [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3663.08s)]
*  external financial help which is needed in egypt do you anticipate any shifts in egypt's foreign [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3669.08s)]
*  relationships i i i don't expect any major shifts in in that regard there will be less money for sure [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3675.64s)]
*  coming from uh less grants coming from from the gulf for their own domestic reasons primarily [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3684.52s)]
*  maybe but egypt has a lot of reasons to continue strategic relations with countries like sudia [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3690.84s)]
*  arabia and united arab emirates beyond the the billions of dollars that they received from [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3696.44s)]
*  from from these countries the challenge for egypt in terms of the economy will not be how to win [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3703.08s)]
*  itself of external financing it will continue to need external financing and i i understand why [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3711.32s)]
*  the issue is about expenditure and not external financing how this money is being spent on what [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3717.8s)]
*  project was what objective and in the lack of an open political discussion we don't really know [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3724.44s)]
*  we hear figures we hear dreams but the issue is it's going to be tougher and tougher to get [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3730.76s)]
*  money and to get returns on some of these mega projects that we are seeing still being constructed [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3736.92s)]
*  it [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3742.28s)]
*  thank you thank you khaled if my and michael have no comments on on the question of foreign [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3746.52s)]
*  relationships we have a question on on civil on charity organizations in egypt not only charity [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3754.36s)]
*  on NGOs in egypt in general pertaining to the red crescent uh slash or red cross if uh you guys [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3764.6s)]
*  are aware of how active the red crescent is the red cross is and are they actively engaged in [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3772.92s)]
*  collecting blood for antibodies in egypt that's a question which takes us back to the core of the [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3779.0s)]
*  public health challenge uh collection of blood for antibodies does any one of you have uh an insight [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3785.08s)]
*  on on the reality of the red crescent red cross in egypt [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3791.8s)]
*  now so i myself have been seeing i mean to to uh to that question i have been reading [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3797.32s)]
*  news i guess like um our panelists today and like uh egypt cultures um regarding um uh how the [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3804.6000000000004s)]
*  ministry of health and population has centralized collecting blood in order to avoid any [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3813.48s)]
*  manipulation in in in in egypt so to my knowledge it's been centralized i'm not sure what kind of [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3821.88s)]
*  tools are being used but blood collection is being centralized and pursued by the ministry [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3828.84s)]
*  of health and population so let me come back to you panelists with an additional question [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3833.32s)]
*  primarily to to to the balance of [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3840.92s)]
*  uh male and female uh voices within the cabinet so and michael um since you've been following [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3846.04s)]
*  egyptian politics and and and sort of that division of labor between the presidency and the cabinet [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3855.88s)]
*  what's striking as well and i'm just reflecting on an earlier discussion i had with some colleagues [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3860.6s)]
*  of of mine and it's not a question which we received we're still waiting for some questions [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3866.52s)]
*  hopefully to come but i just would like you to reflect on whether we're seeing [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3873.2400000000002s)]
*  an additional interesting shift within the cabinet which is as of now presents itself [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3877.48s)]
*  to the public primarily via female voices female ministers the minister of international [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3885.96s)]
*  cooperation the minister of planning the minister of health and population and apart from apart from [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3893.88s)]
*  the prime minister who is a male and the state minister for communication and media who is a [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3901.48s)]
*  male minister it seems the state response seems to be driven primarily by female voices do you see that [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3907.08s)]
*  as possibly leading the way into a different gender balance within the egyptian cabinet [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3912.6s)]
*  yeah i think it's notable and anybody who's watched the the past few months has seen this [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3924.36s)]
*  kind of more prominent female representation on the public stage and again why it has happened [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3930.36s)]
*  is probably much less interesting to than what its potential impact is and of course it's not [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3938.6800000000003s)]
*  again it's not something that's going to have a kind of immediate impact on gender norms and [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3946.36s)]
*  expectations in society but it's the kind of thing that that over time does change the way that people [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3952.28s)]
*  understand gender norms gender expectations and so you know again i think it's something that will [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3961.1600000000003s)]
*  have impact over time i think there's there's no question about that [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3969.08s)]
*  thank you michael and let me stay with you a question which we just received is based on [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3975.56s)]
*  a development that took place recently in egypt the upper house of parliament has been reestablished [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3983.6400000000003s)]
*  by law so the house of representatives passed the law to reestablish the house the upper house [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3989.0s)]
*  of parliament earlier today if i am not mistaken or yesterday so do you expect legislative elections [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=3995.64s)]
*  scheduled for later this year to take place or do you expect postponement and what kind of [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4003.4s)]
*  significance would you attach and and may i have it please come in as well would you attach to [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4011.56s)]
*  upcoming parliamentary elections so first on on on whether there'll be elections at all i think [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4016.8399999999997s)]
*  you know the the biggest driver of those kinds of big political events will be will be the disease [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4025.64s)]
*  itself is it possible practically to hold those kinds of nationwide elections without endangering [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4032.04s)]
*  public health so so first i think that's that's one major consideration and it's a big unknown [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4040.6s)]
*  obviously that hangs over all of these issues in terms of you know the political impact of [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4047.3199999999997s)]
*  having an upper house you know i mean egypt has as long wanted to rule by law you know we [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4055.4s)]
*  we saw this in the mubarak era when there was a kind of fastidious following of of rules that [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4066.44s)]
*  produced autocratic ends but but a sense that they were following laws we saw this with succession [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4075.1600000000003s)]
*  with a variety of things where rules were important to the regime despite the kind of manifest [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4083.56s)]
*  authoritarian outcomes and so you know i think in in some ways these structures matter much less [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4090.84s)]
*  than the ethos of of the ruling regime and so it's hard to imagine that the addition of an [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4099.88s)]
*  uh an additional legislative body is going to have any kind of appreciable impact on on the politics [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4106.52s)]
*  in which formal political life has been has been crushed i mean that's the the entire uh the [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4115.16s)]
*  entirety of the political the cc regime's political project since 2014 um has been to destroy uh [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4121.96s)]
*  formal political life and so um it's hard to imagine that this makes much of a uh that this [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4129.32s)]
*  has a kind of material impact on on political uh developments okay may may you have any any insights [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4135.0s)]
*  i would just add that um the the senate creating a senate as it's going to be called um i think it's [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4144.759999999999s)]
*  really going to manifest as a second or an additional rubber stamp depending on how the [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4152.919999999999s)]
*  procedures of the of the parliament additionally goes i mean the upper house is meant to provide [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4157.16s)]
*  advice or or consultation commenting on existing laws treaties what have you and i think there's no [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4162.5199999999995s)]
*  reason like michael was alluding to the belief that we'll see anything different um we already [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4169.48s)]
*  have the example of the house of representatives with its membership with its political parties [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4174.44s)]
*  we have lots of data on how on where and how laws are initiated mostly most laws that are being [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4179.0s)]
*  passed by the house of representatives are initiated at the cabinet so they're not mp driven [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4185.719999999999s)]
*  laws and i don't see that there have been any changes in the political organizing space to um [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4190.2s)]
*  to to make this any different i think we're just going to end up with a second body of [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4196.52s)]
*  of parliament that is serving the same um rubber stamp role and sort of um putting another putting [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4200.76s)]
*  another vote of approval i would say on legislation um that comes from largely the top down [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4207.160000000001s)]
*  thank you my channel yeah yes as as michael said we we have in egypt for a long time [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4215.96s)]
*  i've had a studious allegiance to to rules and forms and uh and how to respect them and make them [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4223.240000000001s)]
*  actually achieve what we want for me it seems the senate is is largely a body in which you can reward [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4231.72s)]
*  or give some perks to supporters and and and colonies i don't expect it to have any major impact [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4240.04s)]
*  uh on the on the political arena [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4248.759999999999s)]
*  okay so we we we're running out of time and i'm i'm sure you guys um uh have been have been [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4256.28s)]
*  exhausted by by questions and by remarks and so i'm really grateful for all of you it's not easy [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4268.12s)]
*  still to conduct virtual meetings and to use zoom for over an hour so at stanford they keep reminding [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4274.04s)]
*  us that it's so the ideal time for a zoom panel should not exceed an hour preferably 45 minutes [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4280.76s)]
*  so we are a bit over an hour and so we we need to wrap up i have two uh last questions which i'm [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4286.76s)]
*  going to give to you and then ask you in a final round briefly to respond to the two questions if [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4293.56s)]
*  you like and share any closing insights you have so the two questions one is on the dynamics [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4299.08s)]
*  of the government and the private sector whether the expected economic distress [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4306.92s)]
*  might push the government into a search for new compromises with the private sector [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4314.68s)]
*  uh economically and a second question on um whether philanthropy in egypt in general has been [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4321.32s)]
*  negatively or how philanthropy in egypt has been impacted by recent legislation on NGOs the law [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4332.84s)]
*  which was passed a few years ago amended a year ago or a bit more so the impacts on philanthropy [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4339.8s)]
*  in egypt and whether philanthropic organizations have been able to step up in in terms of enabling [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4347.0s)]
*  society to better thank to better tackle and respond to the pandemic which is once again [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4354.12s)]
*  reminding everyone and all of us is a global challenge that we're all facing so um let me [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4358.92s)]
*  let me go to you uh khaled first followed by my followed by michael in a final round of remarks [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4366.28s)]
*  uh thank you very much um in terms of the dynamics between the government and the private [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4374.12s)]
*  sector it was very clear a few days ago when the private sector hospital the hospital sector or the [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4378.5199999999995s)]
*  medical sector has infused uh to uh decrease the prices for uh covered 19 19k and we're talking [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4384.92s)]
*  about icus getting anything between 800 to 1200 dollars a night in in in a country like egypt [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4396.36s)]
*  that's a humongous amount i think with the government also continuing despite all these [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4405.32s)]
*  circumstances and its structural adjustment decreasing subsidies on on on energy prices even [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4412.12s)]
*  for the lowest sectors is also an indication of how the government sees its economic policy and [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4419.32s)]
*  its relationship with the private sector um i think the other point which is more positive is [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4425.16s)]
*  the philanthropy i think the big philanthropies in egypt are largely behind the changes that [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4430.68s)]
*  happen to the civil association law from 2017 to the new version in 20 2019 we are talking in very [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4436.599999999999s)]
*  quickly about organizations that may be controlled or provide probably half the incubators for uh [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4444.04s)]
*  prematurely-born babies in egypt that run hospitals schools that provide like social [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4451.08s)]
*  social services uh we are talking about organizations that have hundreds of billions of [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4457.72s)]
*  dollars uh in an annual budget in in egypt so i think they have become a number to reckon with [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4462.36s)]
*  and that the government works with them as the entities that will pick the slack that the [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4471.24s)]
*  government is needing by moving outside social social services and that's why they have much [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4477.56s)]
*  more greedy group than advocacy-based civil society organizations okay thank you thank you [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4482.04s)]
*  khedet may well just add that i think it's important to to be reminded or look at the [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4489.080000000001s)]
*  existing infrastructure or the existing relationships that existed prior to covid [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4494.76s)]
*  whether it's between the private sector and the government or between civil society and the [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4499.400000000001s)]
*  government this happened fairly quickly right and and not not many anticipated it and i think [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4503.72s)]
*  it's important to recognize that it's unlikely that any pre-existing relationships or pre-existing [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4508.2s)]
*  forms will have changed at this point quickly enough to address any challenges so while there's [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4513.400000000001s)]
*  a positive relationship with charities that relationship some charities that relationship [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4518.4400000000005s)]
*  may have pre-existed covid if there's limitations or or loopholes in the relationship with private [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4523.08s)]
*  sector again those those pre-existed when it comes to covid so i think that whether we see [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4528.76s)]
*  dramatic changes i don't think so because in this moment of emergency much of how the government is [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4535.56s)]
*  responding is very kind of just what's necessary the limited amount kind of whatever gets them to [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4540.04s)]
*  the next day if you will and i think that will also remain the case unfortunately when looking [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4546.280000000001s)]
*  at the rights issues that i had brought up earlier it will stand to see how the arrest [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4550.68s)]
*  campaigns continue we'll stand to see the degree of transparency that is afforded but [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4555.0s)]
*  unfortunately on both of those fronts i don't anticipate any large positive [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4559.24s)]
*  diversions from what we're seeing as a negative trend thank you mike mike could you have the [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4564.84s)]
*  final words yeah just in terms of the government private sector just very briefly you know we've [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4570.44s)]
*  seen macroeconomic improvements in recent years but no trickle-down effect inequality has grown [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4577.8s)]
*  the kind of military-led economic project looking at mega projects you know hasn't had positive [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4584.6s)]
*  social impact so it's the deficiencies were clear prior to the pandemic i think you know it is [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4593.24s)]
*  possible that necessity forces the regime to shift tack but you know they haven't so far they have [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4602.12s)]
*  been very reluctant to knowing very well that you know it hasn't produced the desired effects [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4610.5199999999995s)]
*  so you know it's not something that they will do willingly but i think it's you know depending [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4617.08s)]
*  again on the severity of this crisis i think it's worth noting that the economic crisis [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4621.879999999999s)]
*  is a global one there aren't there aren't sources of easy financing abroad and so [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4627.24s)]
*  um again necessity might be the kind of engine for some change in the future thank you so much [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4634.52s)]
*  michael thank you so much khaled thank you so much may um it was it was a great pleasure to moderate [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4641.96s)]

*  engagement with egyptian voices on what has been happening in egypt politically economically and [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4661.48s)]
*  socially and from a public health perspective we'll continue next week with a panel on thursday [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4667.08s)]
*  tackling enduring crises be it national security crises or of course the water crisis which is a [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4672.759999999999s)]
*  national security crisis and how egypt the egyptian government and civil society are responding to [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4679.0s)]
*  them so in that spirit thank you so much i'm looking forward to being engaged in similar [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak8oJMrQw20&t=4683.719999999999s)]
