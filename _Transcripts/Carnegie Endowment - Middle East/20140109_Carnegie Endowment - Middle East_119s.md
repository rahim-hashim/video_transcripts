# Dunne on the Undemocratic Process in Egypt
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [January 09, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI)
*  International players, including the United States, understandably want to do whatever [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=0.0s)]
*  they can to urge Egypt to get back on a democratic path. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=18.2s)]
*  And the Egyptian authorities have laid out a political roadmap that begins with this [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=22.900000000000002s)]
*  draft constitution referendum and will later move to presidential and parliamentary elections. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=28.72s)]
*  And so the United States wants to urge Egypt to carry these steps out and to carry them [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  out in as free and fair a manner as possible. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=42.4s)]
*  And all of that is understandable. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  But it would be a mistake for the United States, Europe, and others to pass judgment on the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  constitution and the referendum just by themselves without looking at the broader context. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=54.84s)]
*  Because unfortunately, even if these things are carried out correctly, they cannot help [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=61.24s)]
*  Egypt get back on a democratic path while there is a continuing broad human rights problems [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=66.88000000000001s)]
*  and a massive crackdown on the largest opposition movement in the country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  What the United States and Europe should be doing is to look at the referendum and to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=79.8s)]
*  evaluate what took place there, but to evaluate it within a larger context of ongoing unfortunate [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  repression and violence and to urge Egypt to take all the steps that it should, not [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  just narrow technical steps related to the referendum or the constitution, all the steps [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=102.16s)]
*  that are needed to help to stabilize the country and to get it back on a path toward democracy. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkXuYg4-wVI&t=107.96s)]
