# The Path Forward on Iran: Contain, Enforce, Engage
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [October 26, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok)
*  Well, good morning everyone and welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=0.0s)]
*  My name is Bill Burns. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=4.0s)]
*  I'm the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and I am truly delighted [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=5.0s)]
*  to be working together again with Michelle Flournoy and our remarkable colleagues at [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=10.6s)]
*  the Center for New American Security. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  I want to thank David DiBartolo, a visiting fellow at Carnegie, for coordinating this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=18.0s)]
*  project with great skill. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=22.68s)]
*  I want to thank the authors, some of the most thoughtful experts that I know, for tackling [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=24.42s)]
*  this very complicated landscape so rigorously and so creatively. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=29.94s)]
*  And I want to thank colleagues from Washington and around the world who joined the workshops [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=35.06s)]
*  and seminars where the ideas and arguments in this report were tested, argued, and refined. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=39.14s)]
*  As all of you know very well, the United States ended a 35-year diplomatic vacuum with Tehran [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=46.58s)]
*  with one objective in mind, to stop it from developing a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=53.18s)]
*  The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action did precisely that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=58.080000000000005s)]
*  It cut off Iran's pathways to a bomb, sharply constrained its nuclear program, and subjected [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=62.34s)]
*  it to an unprecedentedly strict monitoring and verification regime. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=68.4s)]
*  Reaching this historic agreement required coming to terms with painful realities and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=73.18s)]
*  making difficult compromises, the inevitable outcome of tough multilateral negotiations. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=78.14s)]
*  Thanks to the agreement, Iran today is much further away from a nuclear bomb, and the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=84.74s)]
*  prospect of direct military conflict between the United States and Iran is forestalled. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=89.54s)]
*  We are safer. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=95.22s)]
*  Our partners in the region are safer, and the world is safer. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=96.58s)]
*  The JCPOA, however, is obviously not the end of the diplomatic road with Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=101.06s)]
*  It is merely the beginning, the cornerstone of a broader, longer-term strategy to prevent [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=106.46s)]
*  Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to diminish and counter Iran's threatening behavior, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=112.62s)]
*  from its growing ballistic missile arsenal to its dangerous use of regional proxies to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=118.62s)]
*  its human rights abuses at home. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=123.34s)]
*  This report outlines the key elements of such a strategy, a tough-minded approach to playing [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=126.02s)]
*  a strong American hand against an adversary that is formidable but hardly 10 feet tall. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=131.88s)]
*  It calls on the United States to continue to enforce rigorous implementation of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=138.2s)]
*  nuclear agreement, to embed the agreement in a wider regional strategy, to limit Iran's [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=142.68s)]
*  ability to meddle in the internal affairs of our regional partners or threaten Israel, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=149.04s)]
*  and to engage Iran to avoid inadvertent escalation, make clear our profound concerns about its [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=154.2s)]
*  behavior at home and abroad, address the eventual sunset of some of the nuclear deal's limits, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=160.64s)]
*  and test opportunities to advance shared interests. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=167.28s)]
*  This is all obviously a lot easier said than done. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  There will be no avoiding complicated trade-offs. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=174.12s)]
*  But it is an honest and realistic guide for U.S. policy today and in the difficult years ahead. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=177.12s)]
*  We cannot underestimate the risk posed to this strategy by President Trump's decision [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=183.56s)]
*  to decertify the agreement. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  With the pin pulled out of the Iran grenade and not so gently tossed to Congress, the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=191.88000000000002s)]
*  unwinding of the nuclear agreement is a rapidly increasing risk. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=196.96s)]
*  But there is still a chance to correct course and avoid a strategic own goal of historic proportion. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=201.76000000000002s)]
*  We can and we must push back on Iranian misbehavior without destroying the nuclear agreement, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=208.56s)]
*  without dissolving our diplomatic leverage, and without dismantling the international [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=214.96s)]
*  coalition that the two previous administrations worked so hard to build. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=220.4s)]
*  The truth is that we are far better able to push back against threatening Iranian action [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=225.44s)]
*  across the Middle East with the JCPOA in place than without it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=230.4s)]
*  A unified international community and the unprecedented pressure that it generated was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=235.48000000000002s)]
*  essential to tipping the balance toward compromise within a divided Iranian leadership. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  Now we run the risk of dividing ourselves, fracturing the international community and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=245.8s)]
*  isolating the United States, and unifying Iranian opinion around the hard line of the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=250.36s)]
*  Revolutionary Guards. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=255.76s)]
*  Success will depend in large measure on whether we can keep the burden of proof on Iran, demonstrating [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=257.52s)]
*  America in good faith and seriousness of purpose, and preventing Iran from painting the United [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=262.96s)]
*  States as a diplomatic outlier. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  Threats to abrogate the deal or call for its renegotiation, reimposing nuclear related [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=270.67999999999995s)]
*  sanctions, provocatively threatening military action, or otherwise failing to uphold America's [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=275.76s)]
*  end of the bargain would leave the United States in a weaker, not stronger position [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  to deal with Iran and other looming crises, especially North Korea. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  The strategy laid out in this report offers a roadmap that should appeal to leaders of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=292.44s)]
*  both political parties, and all those serious about being tough on Iran and confident in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=296.76000000000005s)]
*  America's continued strength. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=302.6s)]
*  The decisions made over the coming days and weeks will shape the trajectory of the region [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  and of America's role in the world for years to come. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=309.6s)]
*  So let me conclude by congratulating once again my Carnegie and CNAS colleagues for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=312.6s)]
*  a terrific report and thanking all of you for joining us today. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=317.0s)]
*  So now it's my great pleasure to turn over the proceedings to today's moderator and my [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=321.36s)]
*  newest Carnegie colleague, our Vice President for Communications and Strategy, Jen Psaki. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=325.52s)]
*  Thank you, Bill, and thank you to all of the report authors who are joining us today. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=330.0s)]
*  We know we're going to leave plenty of time for questions from the audience, and we know [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=336.0s)]
*  that during that time we'll likely have questions about the big elephant in the room, which [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  is of course decertification and what's happening in Congress. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=345.12s)]
*  So we're going to dive right into the report recommendations from the top here. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=348.08s)]
*  So let me start with you, Ellie. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  When you walk us through – you write in the report about Iran's nuclear ambitions, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=355.2s)]
*  what we should do in the short and the long term. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  Can you take us from now to eight to 10 years from now? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=363.44s)]
*  If you had a magic wand, what would we be doing? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=368.76s)]
*  What would Europeans be doing to address the long-term challenges? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=371.88s)]
*  First of all, thank you, Jen. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=375.88s)]
*  First of all, I think that the most important aspect we wanted to highlight is that the [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=379.24s)]
*  U.S. is pivotal to what happens next. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=384.6s)]
*  That's point number one. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=387.6s)]
*  That's why we thought that the U.S. would be well-advised to have a comprehensive strategy [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=388.6s)]
*  that thinks of the nuclear and the other things around the nuclear, complements the nuclear [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=393.44s)]
*  and the relationship between the nuclear and the other thing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=398.16s)]
*  And so what we are trying to suggest in terms of U.S. strategy touches the following things. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  Number one is effective implementation. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=406.58000000000004s)]
*  The deal has some innovative aspects, some things that were necessary as a result of, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=409.56s)]
*  you know, inevitable compromises made in the course of negotiations and so on. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=414.52s)]
*  And a very complicated machinery put in place that involved both the Joint Commission and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=419.52s)]
*  the IEA to try and implement those. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  There are obvious issues out there, some of them being resolved over time, some have not. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  But the most important thing going forward for the short to medium term is effective [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=431.88s)]
*  implementation of that machinery. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=435.88s)]
*  There's things that need to be done. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=438.15999999999997s)]
*  Obviously, if it doesn't look like the U.S. is trying to wreck the agreement but merely [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=440.24s)]
*  leverage it and make it more effective, then everyone is better off. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=443.58s)]
*  We are zeroing in on things that ought to be done for effective implementation. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=447.85999999999996s)]
*  So that's issue one of both the JCPOA and the related UN Security Council Resolution [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  2231, particularly on the dual capable missiles, which is a very big concern looking ahead. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=457.53999999999996s)]
*  Second thing is, whereas everyone is talking about sunset provisions beginning to kick [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=465.79999999999995s)]
*  in within, say, six years or so and then gradually becoming more and more meaningful in terms [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=471.62s)]
*  of the sunset, our conviction is that you can't wait until these things begin to phase [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=476.92s)]
*  out in order to try and deal with those nuclear issues. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=482.54s)]
*  Because what is required, if you want to spare yourself the need finally to look at we do [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=486.36s)]
*  nothing or we resort to very extreme coercive measures, is that you need to think about [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=490.90000000000003s)]
*  that is diplomatically supported by intelligence, work multilaterally and work systematically [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=496.96s)]
*  and explore several options rather than one because we're not sure which one will yield. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=503.03999999999996s)]
*  And so what the report is trying to suggest is that we should start thinking both a follow-up [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=507.62s)]
*  agreement with Iran as one possibility but not the only possibility, that we should think [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=513.98s)]
*  about subregional arrangements, a regional arrangement and a global arrangement. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  The last three are not Iran-specific but have a strong impact on what Iran may be entitled [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=523.78s)]
*  to do once they agree and once these clauses begin to phase out. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=529.9399999999999s)]
*  So what we are trying to suggest is that this requires heavy lifting, it requires concentrated [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=534.3399999999999s)]
*  effort by the United States, and above all it requires a strategy. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=539.66s)]
*  So what we think would be helpful is if there was a strategy, the strategy was bipartisan [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=544.3399999999999s)]
*  in the United States and that the implementation started right away with the goal being we [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=549.88s)]
*  don't want Iran not just to have nuclear weapons, we don't want Iran to be a nuclear threshold [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=555.6s)]
*  state with an ability to convert it into an arsenal within a matter of weeks, which would [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=560.58s)]
*  either leave us with a situation where it could happen overnight or they can blackmail [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=567.58s)]
*  us or whatever or have to resort to extreme measures like military means and so on. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=571.24s)]
*  That means diplomacy, it means now, and it means several efforts. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=578.04s)]
*  So does it mean in the report's conclusion, keep the JCPOA, build on that and negotiate [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=582.0799999999999s)]
*  now for what is going to sunset later on? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=588.88s)]
*  Build on it, yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be exactly the same structure [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=591.8399999999999s)]
*  of the negotiations and so on. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=598.6999999999999s)]
*  A different format for the next… [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=600.6999999999999s)]
*  Let's not forget that we do have implementation issues right now. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=603.3s)]
*  The third aspect, which I think we don't get into much detail in the report, but we [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=609.3s)]
*  imply needs to be reflected upon, is can one create a climate that encourages the peaceful [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=614.78s)]
*  transformation of the Iranian nuclear program? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=620.5799999999999s)]
*  Whether that can happen through engagement, through other types of both incentives and [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=623.9799999999999s)]
*  disincentives and so on is something we try to address in the report, but the point is [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=628.3s)]
*  to say, as Ambassador Perns put it, one is to keep the program in check. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=633.18s)]
*  There is also a streak there that says, can we get Iran cooperatively to engage in peaceful [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=641.3s)]
*  transformation of this program? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=647.38s)]
*  That I think is the longer-term goal that we have. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=649.3s)]
*  So we don't just have to use deterrence and coercion and so on to try and keep it [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=651.6999999999999s)]
*  in check all the time. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=656.62s)]
*  Thank you, Ellie. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=658.02s)]
*  And I want to go to you, Alain, next. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=659.02s)]
*  The report talks quite a bit about the role of military assistance, military engagement. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=661.22s)]
*  Can you take us on a quick walk around the world with Iraq, Syria, Yemen? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=666.5s)]
*  What are we doing well? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=672.46s)]
*  What should we be doing differently? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=673.86s)]
*  And how will that help us leverage change in the concerning actions of Iran? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=675.64s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=680.46s)]
*  Thanks, Jen. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=681.46s)]
*  It's great to be here as part of this CNAS Carnegie Joint Operation, which is really sometimes [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=682.46s)]
*  a rarity in the think tank world. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=687.0600000000001s)]
*  And also just want to quickly recognize our two other co-authors, Elisa Catalano, yours, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=688.66s)]
*  and Jared Blank, who are here in the front row, too, but not on the stage since there [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=693.1800000000001s)]
*  wasn't space for six. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=696.78s)]
*  But in terms of – so what do we do now in terms of the region? [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=699.02s)]
*  Interestingly, I'll just start by saying that I think our report is actually tougher [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=704.9s)]
*  on Iran's regional behavior than the president was in his speech. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=707.74s)]
*  He talked a lot in very firm notes about all the long history of difficulties between the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=711.94s)]
*  United States and Iran, as he saw it, in a pretty tough way – probably a little too [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=716.94s)]
*  tough in my opinion. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=721.02s)]
*  But the actual recommendations that came out really weren't all that meaningful. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=722.34s)]
*  You didn't really see all that much. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=727.46s)]
*  And so I think we're trying to put some meat on those bones of what does it actually [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=728.46s)]
*  mean to counter Iran in the region. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=731.22s)]
*  So just a few examples of that. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=733.42s)]
*  I think one, we make the argument that across the region, dealing with the IRGC Quds Force, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=735.74s)]
*  the Hezbollah, and countering them through a combination really of some sanctions, which [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=741.3s)]
*  Liz will talk more about, operations where you simply expose what they are doing in certain [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=746.98s)]
*  places, which can sometimes be quite embarrassing for them and also help generate international [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=753.06s)]
*  attention on those types of actions. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=757.1s)]
*  And combining that also with some covert direct action, military action, in cases where it [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=761.3s)]
*  makes sense and isn't too risky but can actually send a signal to Iran, you don't [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=767.38s)]
*  have to go all the way up the escalation ladder with Iran. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=771.1800000000001s)]
*  What you do have to signal, and sometimes you do these relatively small directed steps, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=774.62s)]
*  and then you send a message along with it, which is you've gone too far here, you're [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=780.5400000000001s)]
*  about to get yourself in a confrontation with the United States if you keep going. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=783.58s)]
*  In my experience, at least when I worked on these issues at the Pentagon, is when we employ [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=787.26s)]
*  that type of approach with the Iranians, the message always got through. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=790.38s)]
*  They want no part of a direct confrontation with the United States. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=793.5400000000001s)]
*  And there would be sort of this pullback. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=797.26s)]
*  Specifically, and so what does this mean in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=799.62s)]
*  In Syria, I think, look, Iran is there for the long term, and the U.S. in many ways isn't, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=803.62s)]
*  at least in Western Syria, will be in Eastern Syria. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=807.86s)]
*  But we still have leverage to do some very specific things. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=810.82s)]
*  The report recommends really focusing on ensuring that in any negotiated outcome and whatever [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=813.5s)]
*  steps are necessary to keep Iranian-supported proxies off of the southwestern border with [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=819.3s)]
*  Israel and with Jordan, which could be really destabilizing. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=825.66s)]
*  That is something that's achievable. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=829.42s)]
*  The Trump administration has been negotiating. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=830.82s)]
*  There's a difference of views right now between the Israelis and the United States about how [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=833.18s)]
*  effective it's been in doing that. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=837.66s)]
*  But that's a very specific objective you can point to. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=839.18s)]
*  And another one in Syria is looking, for example, at ensuring Iran doesn't have, there's a lot [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=842.02s)]
*  of talk about a land bridge and the idea that Iran is going to have this connection all the [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=847.98s)]
*  way from Tehran to Beirut. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=851.42s)]
*  That's, I think, a bit of a stretch. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=854.5s)]
*  That's 1,000 miles to some very tough territory that you're not going to be moving a whole [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=855.5s)]
*  bunch of supplies through. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=859.6600000000001s)]
*  But the more places and key sort of what are called lines of communication, Iran controls [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=861.1s)]
*  and key nodes, the more flexibility it has to move its forces around the region. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=865.62s)]
*  So as we think about our own military strategy, making sure that areas that our partners retake [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=869.34s)]
*  are held by those. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=874.4200000000001s)]
*  In Iraq, really quickly, I think we're not really looking at a military competition. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=875.4200000000001s)]
*  We're looking at a political competition with Iran. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=880.6600000000001s)]
*  They are there. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=882.9000000000001s)]
*  They have a long-term history relationship. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=883.9399999999999s)]
*  They're going to be there. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=884.9399999999999s)]
*  That relationship is cultural. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=886.9399999999999s)]
*  It is political. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=888.9399999999999s)]
*  But we are also going to have troops in Iraq long-term, a few thousand of them probably, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=890.6999999999999s)]
*  to continue to support Iraqi security forces. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=894.5s)]
*  And we are also an influential player, and we have a lot of leverage with the Iraqi central [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=896.98s)]
*  government. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=900.66s)]
*  And so this is going to be really a game of political competition, us using our leverage, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=901.66s)]
*  them using their leverage and influence, in some cases agreeing on things and negotiating [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=905.54s)]
*  with the Iranians to get to your arrangements that work for both sides. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=910.02s)]
*  I think in some cases, trying to counter steps Iran is trying to take, such as support for [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=913.2199999999999s)]
*  various human militias in Iraq. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=916.9s)]
*  And finally, in Yemen, look, I think Yemen is interesting because it matters the least [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=919.38s)]
*  to both sides in some ways, but matters the most to our Saudi partners, which is complicated. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=924.54s)]
*  Iran is not as strategically engaged, nor are we. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=930.4599999999999s)]
*  But I think there is an opportunity to just take a more aggressive stance in how we interdict [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=933.3s)]
*  weapons shipments into Yemen, and how we signal to the Iranians, particularly on any kind [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=938.3s)]
*  of weapons that could impede the passage of basically the transit of commerce through [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=943.42s)]
*  the Bab al-Mandeb, which is a key choke point. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=949.5799999999999s)]
*  And so again, there you have specific limited opportunities. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=952.42s)]
*  But I think this is one of the things our port overall is trying to do, is actually [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=954.78s)]
*  look at specific opportunities, because there have been a lot of talk. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=959.5s)]
*  We've been talking for years about how we're going to counter Iran in the Middle East. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=961.8199999999999s)]
*  But when it actually comes to action, it becomes a lot harder to do. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=965.62s)]
*  And you actually really have to pinpoint and zoom in on specific steps that you can take. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=968.02s)]
*  So I would argue just finally on the regional question, and we'll hear more about it from [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=972.34s)]
*  others, is even as we take all these steps to push back, as Ambassador Burns mentioned, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=975.42s)]
*  as we'll hear from others, the report also really emphasizes pressure is one half of [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=980.06s)]
*  the equation, and the other half has to be engagement on all these issues, too. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=984.18s)]
*  And that's what worked on the nuclear deal and can work in this context as well. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=987.78s)]
*  So let me just follow up on the Yemen piece, because the report is pretty forward on Yemen [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  and what our role and engagement should be there. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=995.0600000000001s)]
*  Are we too engaged in Yemen? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=997.54s)]
*  Is that hurting us? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=998.82s)]
*  Are we, should we do more? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1000.02s)]
*  But giving more military assistance to Saudi Arabia seems to be conflicting to most people. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1001.82s)]
*  Are they not? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1007.14s)]
*  So can you talk just a tiny bit more about that? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1008.1800000000001s)]
*  That's like the hardest question. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1010.14s)]
*  It's one that I think- That's what I'm here for. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1011.74s)]
*  That honestly, even amongst the authors, we had some pretty intense debates and sort of [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1014.74s)]
*  views of, and I think it's the same thing, the struggle in the US government. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1019.5s)]
*  Because on the one hand, you can't look at the Yemen crisis and not think that in many [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1021.86s)]
*  ways what Saudi Arabia is doing is problematic and sort of, in my view, against its own interests [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1025.98s)]
*  long term and how it's gotten engaged in a war that's really not healthy for the region [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1031.1s)]
*  and doesn't seem to have good outcomes for them. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1037.94s)]
*  But on the other, you're trying to get the Saudis in some ways to back down a little [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1040.6200000000001s)]
*  bit in terms of their confrontation with Iran. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1045.66s)]
*  And one of the ways you do that is by reassuring them, letting them know the US is actually [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1048.18s)]
*  there for them, but also then trying to send signals that come along with that that say, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1051.98s)]
*  we are there for you. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1055.98s)]
*  We will support you, but don't go here or there or the other place. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1056.98s)]
*  And maybe that's a better way of dealing with it than simply trying to walk away or press [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1062.02s)]
*  the Saudis, which would send that signal. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1066.0s)]
*  It's also this complicated situation because even though we're not as strategically invested, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1068.66s)]
*  neither are the Iranians. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1074.22s)]
*  So it's a place where if you actually push back and signal to the Iranians, we're going [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1076.74s)]
*  to get more invested, they're much more likely to back down. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1080.7s)]
*  And that's beneficial to us and also beneficial to our partners who care about it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1084.46s)]
*  Where in places like Syria or in Iraq, if you were to say, get out of Iraq or get out [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1090.1s)]
*  of Syria, I think you'd get a shrug from the Iranians and a double down on what they're [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1093.6200000000001s)]
*  actually trying to do. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1097.5s)]
*  So yeah, but that's not a very good answer because I don't think there are very good [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1098.5s)]
*  answers. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1102.18s)]
*  Maybe someone in the audience will have one to offer. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1103.18s)]
*  Let me go to you, Liz, next, because there's quite a bit in the report on economic levers. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1106.98s)]
*  Can you talk and obviously this report was written long before recent announcements by [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1111.98s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1116.9s)]
*  They did make an announcement about some economic sanctions. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1118.8200000000002s)]
*  Are those the right direction? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1121.98s)]
*  Should there be more? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1123.22s)]
*  What would be most impactful now in the view of the of the authors? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1124.22s)]
*  And thanks to our Carnegie colleagues for being here. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1129.5s)]
*  Thanks to all of you for coming to us in this conversation. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1131.74s)]
*  I like that you use the phrase economic levers because what that does is encompass the concept [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1135.1399999999999s)]
*  Elan just mentioned and that you'll see in this report for thinking about pressure points [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1140.4599999999998s)]
*  as well as engagement opportunities, recognizing that no strategy is complete when it just [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1146.5s)]
*  involves pressure and that the United States reaps the kind of strategic advantage when [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1152.1399999999999s)]
*  it can be prepared to say take yes for an answer and which hopefully in our view will [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1156.5s)]
*  give greater options and more flexibility in the execution of this policy. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1163.98s)]
*  So the current administration has come forward with some good sanction in my view, some good [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1169.3s)]
*  sanctions policies and delivery of new sanctions on Iran related to they are non-nuclear in [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1178.22s)]
*  nature. So ballistic missile activities for terrorism, recognizing Iran's support for [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1185.6200000000001s)]
*  terrorism in its targeting of these sanctions, as well as actually human rights related sanctions [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1191.26s)]
*  related to Iran. That's good. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1197.06s)]
*  And what we would suggest as authors of this report is that there actually needs to be much [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1199.9s)]
*  more and it needs to be more holistic or expensive. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1204.66s)]
*  So more sanctions, more aggressive posture when it comes to identifying IRGC targets [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1208.18s)]
*  inside and outside of Iran. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1215.26s)]
*  There's a strategic value in identifying its front companies and agents and signaling, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1217.22s)]
*  therefore, to Iran's leaders, an economic advantage, even a strategic one for them, of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1224.14s)]
*  allowing its independent economy, so that is to say, non-IRGC controlled economy to grow, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1229.74s)]
*  given the pressure IRGC linked companies will be under. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1238.94s)]
*  Additionally, we talk about more sanctions targeting missile, Iran's missile program [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1245.26s)]
*  and other terrorist proxies in the region. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1253.22s)]
*  We call out further sanctions, the need for further sanctions targeting Hezbollah companies, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1256.02s)]
*  bankers, financiers, facilitators and support to Assad. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1261.22s)]
*  Another thing that we identified here that must be part of the strategy, and this didn't [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1265.22s)]
*  come through from President Trump's discussion of the topic so far, but we must all hope [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1270.02s)]
*  that it is behind the scenes contemplated or will shortly be executed. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1276.34s)]
*  Thinking about how to coordinate closely with allies on how to reimpose sanctions if [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1281.86s)]
*  there is an actual nuclear breach. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1287.66s)]
*  So interestingly, with what has just gone down recently and the president not certifying [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1289.42s)]
*  to Congress, Iran's, it's actually the language used here is that sanctions relief is proportional [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1294.98s)]
*  to the concessions Iran is making the deal, so it's not actually the president saying [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1301.7s)]
*  that Iran is in breach of its nuclear commitments, but nevertheless, the administration must [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1308.5800000000002s)]
*  be on the same page with allies about how to calibrate, sequence and work together to [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1314.3400000000001s)]
*  reimpose nuclear sanctions if and when there is a breach by Iran. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1321.78s)]
*  And what that will mean is that the United States isn't facing a confusing situation [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1326.5s)]
*  of moving forward with sanctions unilaterally, which would really risk the cogency and effectiveness [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1331.46s)]
*  of sanctions. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1339.06s)]
*  We've seen that discussed recently as people are contemplating what it would mean for the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1340.66s)]
*  United States to walk away from the deal and proceed unilaterally with the reimposition [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1344.66s)]
*  of sanctions, which would come at the expense of a lot of their force. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1348.42s)]
*  The other lever here that we talk about in the report when it comes to economic issues [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1353.6200000000001s)]
*  or sanctions issues has to do with the way in which the United States could engage with [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1358.98s)]
*  Iran. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1364.1000000000001s)]
*  So beyond ideas that are in here for keeping channels of communication open at the government [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1364.74s)]
*  level as appropriate and at a non-governmental level as well, and other people-to-people [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1370.5s)]
*  contact, there's ideas that we suggest the offering of certain concessions where there's [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1377.7s)]
*  certainly trade space with Iran where a give from the United States would be meaningful [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1384.26s)]
*  to Iran in exchange for which they may make meaningful concessions to the United States [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1391.22s)]
*  and our interests. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1396.5800000000002s)]
*  And those include contemplating restoring the U-turn license to allow non-U.S. financial [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1398.0200000000002s)]
*  institutions to, on behalf of legitimate Iranian clients, clear dollars through U.S. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1405.14s)]
*  jurisdiction, through U.S. banks. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1412.8200000000002s)]
*  That's something that Iranians have said they really would like. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1414.3400000000001s)]
*  It would be very meaningful for them economically, which is, of course, a major priority. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1418.26s)]
*  So it would be good to think about what the trade would be for the United States to give [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1423.7s)]
*  a major concession like that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1430.74s)]
*  But actually taking that in hand and moving forward with that instead of only preferring [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1432.66s)]
*  a strategy that involves pressure. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1437.6200000000001s)]
*  MS. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1439.22s)]
*  BENTON-KLEIN So very quickly, before we go to Kareem, who's [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1439.74s)]
*  been patiently waiting with brilliant thoughts over here, can you talk briefly – you talked [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1442.1000000000001s)]
*  about partners, which is a really important point. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1446.98s)]
*  Hopefully we'll get into more with the Q&A – Russia's role here in working with them [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1448.8200000000002s)]
*  as a partner and staying aligned on sanctions and kind of what should be done or the state [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1454.3400000000001s)]
*  of that, I guess. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1459.46s)]
*  MS. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1460.1s)]
*  BENTON-KLEIN Well, it's a complicated issue for anyone [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1461.1s)]
*  who's watched over the last couple of years or since 2014, during which time the United [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1463.86s)]
*  States was both in lockstep with Russia with respect to Iran sanctions, but of course the [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1468.98s)]
*  United States and European allies imposed sanctions on Russia. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1475.62s)]
*  But during that time, those international relationships between Europe, European partners [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1479.54s)]
*  of the United States, United States, and Russia, this worked out. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1484.8999999999999s)]
*  There was the opportunity for both pressure in one domain on Russia with respect to sanctions [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1488.82s)]
*  as well as maintenance of the Iran sanctions policy. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1493.9399999999998s)]
*  It would obviously be very important for the United States to keep Russia [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1498.1s)]
*  onside when thinking about how to move forward with Iran. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1502.98s)]
*  Another good reason why unilateral sanctions in any instance are a bad idea, but when it [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1509.06s)]
*  comes to how to move forward on sanctions with – on Iran, European partners must be [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1515.54s)]
*  the first ones with which the United States is closely aligned, and then I think the priority [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1523.06s)]
*  is from there to bring Russia and China as a party to the JCPOA into the same place. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1527.94s)]
*  This is – I'm talking about this in terms of the – at the meta level, whether we have [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1533.78s)]
*  not and major follow-on or amended addendum agreements. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1538.82s)]
*  But when we're – Russia hasn't been a close partner at the level of more targeted [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1545.78s)]
*  ballistic missile sanctions or terrorism ones, so I'm just talking about the bigger strategic issue. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1552.74s)]
*  MS. MULLER-KERNAN-BETTMANN Great. Thank you. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1557.22s)]
*  So, Kareem, before we go to questions from the audience, the report talks quite a bit, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1558.82s)]
*  as Liz and others have touched on, about the importance of pressure and engagement. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1563.06s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about the levers of engagement that are discussed in the report [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1567.46s)]
*  with Iranian officials, indirect, and also people-to-people? Where could we be doing [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1571.8600000000001s)]
*  better? Where are the opportunities there to open lines of negotiation about some of the [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1578.26s)]
*  issues touched on in the report? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1583.46s)]
*  MR. KERNAN-BETTMANN It's a great question, Jen, and thank you all for coming. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1584.98s)]
*  For me, one of the most important strategic takeaways of the report is that over the last [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1588.26s)]
*  four decades, there's been very few instances in which Iran has backed down its compromise, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1592.98s)]
*  but those instances have been when it's faced with external pressure, unified external front, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1598.34s)]
*  and it's divided at home. And the dynamic which President Trump has created is exactly the opposite. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1607.06s)]
*  He's splintered the international community against Iran, and he's unified Iran's internal [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1613.94s)]
*  factions, both its internal political factions and the gap between the regime population. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1620.42s)]
*  So there are many things that Iran is doing in the world which are bad, its domestic repression, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1627.0600000000002s)]
*  human rights abuses, its complicity in the mass slaughter and dislocation of Syria. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1633.46s)]
*  But instead of focusing on the bad things that Iran is doing, the president has put his finger [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1640.5800000000002s)]
*  on the one thing that Iran appears to be doing right in the eyes of much of the world. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1646.34s)]
*  And for that reason, I think that international public opinion on this issue has really isolated [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1651.9399999999998s)]
*  the United States more than it has Iran. So what would a different approach look like, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1657.54s)]
*  which would also include engagement? I think that, again, if you take the model of the nuclear [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1662.74s)]
*  agreement which Ilan talked about, it was a combination of significant unified international [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1669.46s)]
*  pressure coupled with rigorous US-led diplomacy. And I think that formula really hasn't been applied [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1676.18s)]
*  to the regional context or even to the Iran domestic context. To basically go to our partners [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1683.38s)]
*  and allies, to the Europeans, the Chinese and the Russians, and say, okay, listen, we don't really [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1689.3s)]
*  love this nuclear deal, but we'll continue to respect it if you play a much stronger role in [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1694.1s)]
*  helping us counter Iran's regional behavior, if you show a louder voice in condemning Iran's [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1701.06s)]
*  internal human rights abuses. But again, instead of focusing on the things that Iran is doing wrong, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1707.9399999999998s)]
*  we've put our finger on the thing that much of our partners believe Iran is doing right. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1714.1799999999998s)]
*  And for that reason, I think we've been somewhat isolated. The final thing I'll say [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1718.42s)]
*  is that the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, has said for three decades now that America is [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1723.54s)]
*  untrustworthy and arrogant. And for the first time, I think he feels vindicated in the eyes of his [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1730.42s)]
*  population and those more pragmatic factions in Iran who favor a better relationship with the [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1737.0600000000002s)]
*  United States. And I think that, again, rather than the goal of engagement, whether or not you [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1742.58s)]
*  think engagement can be successful, is to create a debate in Iran among the vast majority of a [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1750.58s)]
*  population who wants to be integrated, not isolated, amongst political factions in Iran [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1760.82s)]
*  who no longer believe that death to America makes sense in terms of Iran's national interests. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1768.58s)]
*  And again, to make the case to all of our partners worldwide that the United States is trying to play [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1775.22s)]
*  a mature role, a responsible role here, and Iran is the rejectionist party, not America. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1781.46s)]
*  MS. PSAKI So last quick question, just because I've [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1789.86s)]
*  pressed everybody else. So if the government, the current government were to reengage with Iran, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1792.18s)]
*  at what level should they do that? Who should be engaging with whom in Iran? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1798.26s)]
*  MR. BENTON-KATZ One of the perennial challenges we've had with Iran, as Ambassador Burns knows [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1802.66s)]
*  well, is that Iran's most powerful officials are often inaccessible and its most accessible [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1807.0600000000002s)]
*  officials often aren't powerful. And the reality is we don't have the luxury of choosing our Iranian [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1813.0600000000002s)]
*  interlocutors. I know this is a frustration that many people, many Saudis, for example, have. They [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1820.58s)]
*  say, you know, our problem isn't with Foreign Ministers Arif and President Rouhani, it's with [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1826.5s)]
*  Supreme Leader Khamenei and Qasem Soleimani, and we don't have access to those people. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1831.22s)]
*  But, you know, so on one hand you don't choose your interlocutors. I think that [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1836.8999999999999s)]
*  our previous interlocutors, being the foreign ministry, will have to continue. But at the same [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1842.74s)]
*  time, you know, we sometimes make too much of the gap between these factions and that, you know, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1848.82s)]
*  at the end of the day, Javad Zarif is the foreign minister to the Supreme Leader, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1855.06s)]
*  and if you want to relay a message to the Supreme Leader, he's as good a person as any to do that. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1860.4199999999998s)]
*  MS. BENTON-KATZ Well, great. Well, now we're going to spend the rest of the time taking [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1866.1s)]
*  questions from the audience. If you'd simply raise your hand, I think we'll come around with [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1870.4199999999998s)]
*  a microphone. We'll come around with a microphone. Okay. Tom Countryman, good to see you. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1873.78s)]
*  MR. COOPER Thank you. You've convinced us what should be done, as Jen predicted. We want to talk [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1879.3799999999999s)]
*  a little bit about what will happen. It's probably easier to predict the score of the next two World [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1890.34s)]
*  Series games than to predict what the White House will do. But in the event that the Congress is [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1896.26s)]
*  unable to decide anything meaningful or anything at all, which is very possible, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1902.18s)]
*  do you expect that this White House will simply pull out of the agreement? And if they do, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1910.3400000000001s)]
*  does that undermine or erase everything else that is in your strategy? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1917.6200000000001s)]
*  MS. BENTON-KATZ I'll start with a comment on Congress, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1923.7s)]
*  and then you can take the White House piece. How about that? [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1929.86s)]
*  MR. COOPER A pivot from that one. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1931.62s)]
*  MS. BENTON-KATZ I feel like I've got the easier one in this case. But I think there are low odds [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1933.78s)]
*  that Congress will, in this 60-day window following the president's non-certification, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1940.74s)]
*  act on their legal opportunity or parliamentary opportunity to reimpose sanctions. I also don't [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1947.3799999999999s)]
*  think that all nuclear sanctions by simple majority, et cetera, as is allowed for in [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1953.22s)]
*  our piece of legislation. I also don't think it's likely that they will attract enough support to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1961.0600000000002s)]
*  pass a piece of legislation akin to the currently articulated cotton corker set of provisions, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1968.3400000000001s)]
*  which would, I think, as is widely interpreted, unilaterally up the ante on the deal, imposing a [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1977.46s)]
*  series of new trigger points or conditions, therefore also in the eyes of many, by default, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1985.8600000000001s)]
*  being violative of the deal and have the effect of pulling the United States out of it if it was [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=1994.3400000000001s)]
*  put into law. I think Congress – I think odds are that Congress won't do anything in the [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2000.74s)]
*  nuclear realm before January and that there may be a legislative proposal to address non-nuclear [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2007.78s)]
*  concerns with Iran, not that it will necessarily be finalized and passed into law at that time. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2014.74s)]
*  And that's something that I think many people would get on board with in Congress and, broadly [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2020.8200000000002s)]
*  speaking, in the administration and others who watch this space, which then kicks the can back [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2026.02s)]
*  to the White House contemplating what they will do. And I'll just offer my two cents by saying I [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2032.58s)]
*  don't think the administration's hope is to pull out of the deal in January at the next [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2038.98s)]
*  best legal opportunity to do so when many of the sanctions under the 120-day or 180-day [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2047.1399999999999s)]
*  waiver timelines come up for renewal. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2055.38s)]
*  MR. BENTON-KLEIN So the one thing I'll add – I'll agree with everything Liz just said. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2058.1000000000004s)]
*  I'd add a couple things. One is I don't think it's just about Congress. I think there's also [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2062.98s)]
*  an opportunity here for Europe to play a role in giving the administration an out. The president [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2067.7000000000003s)]
*  needs something. The president needs to be able to say, I'm working on these problems, whether it's [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2072.1000000000004s)]
*  the sunset provisions or Iran's regional behavior. And so if he's able to say, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2077.14s)]
*  whether it's January or soon thereafter or before, I have agreement from our European partners, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2083.62s)]
*  from France and the UK and Germany, to start discussions on how we're going to deal with the [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2089.62s)]
*  sunset provisions, to start – we're going to work together more on dealing with things like [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2094.98s)]
*  Hezbollah. It's up in some ways to our European partners to help create that out for him, but only [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2098.58s)]
*  under the condition that he stays in the nuclear agreement. To me, that seems like the best outcome [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2104.5s)]
*  for the deal and the best outcome for our policy. It's not easy for our European partners to do that [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2109.54s)]
*  because they've already been making the case like to that – that case to him, saying why don't you [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2113.94s)]
*  not decertify? He's ignored them. He's not politically popular in Europe. So for them to [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2118.58s)]
*  essentially be seen as giving in to the president and for him to declare victory off of this is [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2124.9s)]
*  pretty unpalatable for them, but might be the best way to save the deal. The two scenarios I'm [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2131.7s)]
*  worried about is most realistic for how the agreement falls apart. One is Congress does – [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2138.18s)]
*  Congress has said, at least Democrats have said, they're not going to move anything that in their [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2143.38s)]
*  view violates a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. But they move something and the administration [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2146.98s)]
*  interprets it a certain way and there's disagreements and you get to a point where they [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2153.38s)]
*  pass something that Europe or Iran views as a violation of the JCPOA and slowly things start [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2157.7s)]
*  to unravel. So that's one scenario, something that could happen whether it's before January or after. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2162.58s)]
*  And the other scenario is we do get to January or the president waives in January and it's 120 days [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2168.1s)]
*  later or whenever and eventually he does decide to sabotage the agreement unilaterally because [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2175.2999999999997s)]
*  reality is he could do it all by himself. He doesn't need Congress for any of this. All he has to do is [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2181.06s)]
*  not waive sanctions and the agreement goes away. One of the odd things about this whole rigmarole [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2185.14s)]
*  we went through a couple weeks ago, he doesn't actually need Congress for any of it. So there [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2190.2599999999998s)]
*  comes a moment where whether – even if all the people around him are saying don't do this, which [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2193.8599999999997s)]
*  sounds like many of them are, and even if it's not the full reimposition of the sanctions, he [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2199.54s)]
*  goes far enough. He kills the Boeing and Airbus deals, which I think would potentially destabilize [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2204.42s)]
*  the agreement certainly, something like that. And so those are the two scenarios I worry about and [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2209.46s)]
*  I think – I'm most happy if Europe is the one providing him political cover more so than [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2214.42s)]
*  Congress because I think less can go wrong there, but we'll see. It's going to have to be some [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2219.7000000000003s)]
*  combination. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2223.06s)]
*  Oli, you wanted to add? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2223.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, from the perspective of a naive Israeli, I want to say the following. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2225.1400000000003s)]
*  There is one perspective that says do no harm for Congress. Certainly desirable. There is [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2232.1000000000004s)]
*  one that says maybe we have no window of opportunity here. Regardless of what triggered the crisis or [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2238.58s)]
*  whether we would have triggered the crisis in the first place, isn't there an opportunity – and [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2243.06s)]
*  that's why I'm saying maybe a naive Israeli could believe that this could be a favorable outcome – [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2246.98s)]
*  that there will be a bipartisan and premature to U.S.-Iran policy that would not address the [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2251.7s)]
*  GTPOA as such, but would address Iran's nuclear behavior, original behavior, lay down some markers [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2257.06s)]
*  of things that are acceptable for the bipartisans, and then the operational aspect of this we discuss [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2262.34s)]
*  in our report. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2267.62s)]
*  Okay. All right. Other questions? Okay, we have one in the way back. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. Way, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2269.2200000000003s)]
*  way back there. Yes. I think you have a maroon sweater on. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2276.42s)]
*  Dan Lieberman. I read here that healthy forces have launched a number of missile strikes on ships, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2281.78s)]
*  and the United States should hold Iran responsible for these types of attacks. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2288.5800000000004s)]
*  But of course, it's clear the capability is not in thickness. Now, I just have two questions. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2293.5400000000004s)]
*  Why are U.S. ships off the Yemeni coast, which is a foreign coast, and if the U.S. is concerned [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2298.5s)]
*  about some harmless missiles that fall in the sea, why are they not equally concerned about [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2305.1400000000003s)]
*  the Saudi air force attacks on the Yemeni people, which are really destroying Yemen, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2311.6200000000003s)]
*  and which is as clear that the Saudi capability is not in thickness? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2318.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay. I can start on the issue of the, you know, we're talking about the Bab al-Mandeb, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2324.58s)]
*  which is an international waterway, the key choke point where a large portion of the world's [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2331.06s)]
*  commerce go through. So what we're worried about is not U.S. warships being shot at. What we're [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2339.22s)]
*  worried about is insecurity that makes it impossible to move anything through that [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2342.8199999999997s)]
*  territory and through those waters, which is critical for just global commerce and the global [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2347.38s)]
*  commons. And so I think for the U.S., that is a different level of strategic interest. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2353.06s)]
*  Not that we don't have an interest in making sure the humanitarian crisis in Yemen isn't brought to [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2359.7s)]
*  an end, not that we don't have an interest in some of these other concerns, but I think it's a [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2363.7799999999997s)]
*  question of, you know, if you just look at the American national interest, that question of [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2368.66s)]
*  keeping these waterways open and that being a norm, whether it's the Bab al-Mandeb, the Suez Canal, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2373.86s)]
*  the Straits of Hormuz, the Straits of Malakale, these are critical points that have global [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2380.02s)]
*  implications everywhere, in Asia, the U.S., or Middle East, and Europe, that really need to remain [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2387.14s)]
*  open and free and not, you know, under any kind of a threat. And that's why I think we put such an [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2392.34s)]
*  emphasis on that report. So there's some more questions. I saw you sort of raising your hand [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2399.06s)]
*  here, right in the front. Go ahead. Oh, we need a microphone? Okay, go ahead. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2403.14s)]
*  Hi, Nazan Isarush with IHS. I have two questions, if I may. First question is, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2410.98s)]
*  let's say that we move beyond the immediate issues on the outlook for JCPOA with [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2417.46s)]
*  decertification and everything. Do you think that the U.S. can live with some of the expirations of [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2424.42s)]
*  U.N. Security Council restrictions on Iranian rearmament and the ballistic missile program in [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2430.66s)]
*  2020 and 2023? It seems to me that those are earlier timelines than, let's say, renegotiating [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2435.94s)]
*  on Iranian, on those issues with Iran once some of the nuclear restrictions sort of expire. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2442.3399999999997s)]
*  And the second question has to do with IRGC, targeting of IRGC economic network, [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2449.94s)]
*  with the terrorist sort of designation that has just been put on the IRGC. It seems to me that [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2456.26s)]
*  the targeting, the enforcement of sanctions on IRGC entities is going to be accelerated and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2464.26s)]
*  expanded. What happens if we push so much that the IRGC no longer sees benefit from the nuclear [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2470.58s)]
*  agreement and they have the capability to get Iran to withdraw from the agreement, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2479.38s)]
*  so in an indirect manner undermine the JCPOA? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2486.42s)]
*  Yeah, although actually I wanted to put that question first to Kareem about, in thinking [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2491.94s)]
*  about domestic dynamics within Iran, the role of the IRGC as an influencer in that kind of [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2495.86s)]
*  highest level international commitment to agreement. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2504.1s)]
*  In some ways, the paradox of the Revolutionary Guards is that they have thrived much more in [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2508.98s)]
*  isolation than they would in an integrated environment because when and if Iran truly [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2513.3s)]
*  opens up to the world and you have major international corporations investing in Iran, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2518.98s)]
*  you maybe have more qualified diaspora people coming back, that's much more difficult for the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2523.3s)]
*  Revolutionary Guards to compete in that environment. In some ways, they're a mafia which benefits [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2528.18s)]
*  from darkness more than sunlight. I could see a scenario whereby, and frankly I think, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2534.2599999999998s)]
*  just to make a personal point, I have a close friend, Siyamak Namazi, who has been in prison [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2542.4199999999996s)]
*  in Iran for two years now, he's an Iranian-American, and he was encouraged by the Rouhani government, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2548.66s)]
*  like they encourage other diaspora Iranians to come back and bring in foreign investment, and [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2555.62s)]
*  four days after he arrived in Iran, the Revolutionary Guards took away his passport, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2562.26s)]
*  a couple months later he was in prison. He's now been two years in jail, and so I think the IRGC [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2566.7400000000002s)]
*  actually feels in some ways much more threatened by Iran's integration than its isolation. So [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2571.94s)]
*  when people say that Khamenei hasn't seen the economic benefits of the nuclear deal, therefore [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2578.58s)]
*  he's unpleased with it, will Khamenei give speeches saying that foreign investment is a [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2583.94s)]
*  trojan horse for regime change? So it's never been his priority to bring in foreign investment and [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2588.66s)]
*  have an economically integrated Iran. But the question is, if people aren't seeing the benefits, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2594.7400000000002s)]
*  the economic benefits of the nuclear deal, what does that do to the fate of people like Rouhani [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2601.7000000000003s)]
*  and Zarif? And frankly, I think that the population will give them the benefit of the doubt because [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2606.5s)]
*  they'll see that they really made an effort, but they didn't have the power. It was either [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2612.5s)]
*  President Trump in Washington or hardline forces in Iran who helped sabotage them. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2618.66s)]
*  Can I just add one more piece to the end of this? I think you may have indirectly made our point [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2623.78s)]
*  about the value of pressure and engagement, because if you contemplate a strategy where there's an [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2630.1s)]
*  intensive, by the way, I don't agree that the designation of the IRGC last week on the 12th, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2636.58s)]
*  as it was 13th, whatever that was, was an indication that we'll see much more aggressive [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2648.18s)]
*  targeting. I do sort of hope that's the case, but I don't know that I believe that that is our [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2654.18s)]
*  bellwether here. But if you see only an aggressive targeting of IRGC targets in front companies and [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2658.8199999999997s)]
*  proxies and agents internationally, but you don't also see the opportunity preserved for other [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2667.06s)]
*  foreign companies, these would not be U.S. companies, but Europeans and others to go in [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2674.9s)]
*  and conduct what is legitimate trade and legitimate investment in Iran, then you might be courting [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2679.38s)]
*  that scenario, which is why it doesn't work out well to only lean hard on a pressure strategy. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2684.2599999999998s)]
*  You must also complement it with, and there's a couple of other recommendations we have in this [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2690.98s)]
*  including the United States using its influence in the IMF for the team that is helping Iran to [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2695.7s)]
*  clean up a number of its domestic economic problems to go ahead and do so, which will have the effect [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2705.62s)]
*  of fostering greater legitimate investment and trade in and with Iran to counter that effect that [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2711.7s)]
*  you pointed out. Just to comment on the ballistic missile issue, I want to desegregate the ballistic [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2719.54s)]
*  missile issue into three components. Component one, the dual capable ballistic missiles. I think this [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2725.46s)]
*  is the issue of utmost concern because the country doesn't invest in such a massive investment and [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2731.7s)]
*  develop those capabilities unless you actually have nuclear capability in mind to marry it with. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2739.46s)]
*  The problem is that as the beginning of the restrictions of the of the JCPOA [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2746.58s)]
*  begin to kick in, this could take us from a threshold state just based on fissile material [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2752.82s)]
*  that could produce a device quickly to one that would have an arsenal quickly, no DPRK style. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2757.38s)]
*  So I think this ought to be the highest priority and the U.S. should leverage the UN Security [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2762.7400000000002s)]
*  Council and do a unilateral step and that's what the report is talking about. On the other extreme [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2766.98s)]
*  is the transfer of ballistic missile capabilities and other cruise missile capabilities to Hezbollah [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2771.62s)]
*  and deployment in Syria and so on, which is a great concern. The moment Israel is doing the [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2776.8199999999997s)]
*  burden of that work and so on, I think the U.S. by itself together with Russia, together with Israel, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2781.14s)]
*  together with and so on, should focus a lot of effort on this. Iran has already implied on some [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2785.94s)]
*  of the instruments that should be implied here, intelligence, military and others, but also not [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2790.42s)]
*  just the U.S. doing itself, working with allies. The third component is, and I'm saying this [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2794.74s)]
*  reluctantly, some of the ballistic missile capability of Iran is something we have to come [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2800.58s)]
*  to grips with and accept, not because we love it, but because at the end of the day if we want to [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2807.62s)]
*  try and accomplish some result on the first and the second, and we also push on the third, we [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2813.54s)]
*  would get nothing. So I think we need to prioritize and what the report is trying to prioritize and [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2818.34s)]
*  basically says the most stabilizing things in the region are the long-range things that could be [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2823.46s)]
*  used with nuclear weapons, the ones that are transferred into Syria and Lebanon and potentially [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2828.9s)]
*  used around Yemen and so on. The last category, which is they think they could legitimately [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2833.94s)]
*  argue for self-defense given their air force weaknesses and so on, we simply have to accept. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2839.94s)]
*  It doesn't mean we don't do anything, but we have to generally accept that category. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2845.14s)]
*  I wanted to get to as many people as possible. Go ahead here on the front. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2849.2200000000003s)]
*  I've numerous times you've talked about the United States being isolated. Does that mean much more [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2851.78s)]
*  than it's in a minority or what happens when the United States is isolated? Does Europe refuse to [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2859.6200000000003s)]
*  trade with the U.S. or do they become take away sanctions on Russia? So about 100 percent, correct [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2864.98s)]
*  me if I'm wrong, about 99 percent, if not 100 percent of Iranian trade is with countries other [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2874.5s)]
*  than the United States. Is that right? 99 plus. Okay, so if 99 plus percent of Iranian trade is [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2880.5s)]
*  with countries other than the United States and U.S. and AXE are very strict unilateral measures [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2888.9s)]
*  against Iran, but the outside world, China, South Korea, Japan, European partners, Russia, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2897.22s)]
*  don't adhere to them because they feel like Iran has been wrongly censured. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2906.18s)]
*  It's much more difficult to pressure Iran if Iran has exit doors in all those places. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2910.58s)]
*  And part of this is, as I said, kind of the court of international public opinion. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2918.18s)]
*  During the era of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, it became very clear to the outside world that President [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2926.5s)]
*  Obama had made these unprecedented but unreciprocated overtures to Tehran, and it was [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2932.5s)]
*  Ahmadinejad that was the problem. And I think he really, in some ways, doesn't get the credit he [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2938.18s)]
*  deserves. Ahmadinejad doesn't get the credit he deserves for helping to bring about this coalition [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2944.18s)]
*  against Iran. And we now, I don't want to overstate this, but to some extent, you know, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2949.78s)]
*  we have an opposite dynamic, which is that Iran's leadership, in my opinion, wrongly, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2954.82s)]
*  but in my opinion, Iran's leadership, President Rouhani, Foreign Minister Zarif, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2960.74s)]
*  appear to be reasonable and pragmatic people. And it's America's president who appears to be [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2965.54s)]
*  the intransigent actor and equation. And again, history has proven over the last several decades [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2973.3799999999997s)]
*  that when it's only unilateral U.S. pressure and it's not followed by, it's not accompanied [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2981.2999999999997s)]
*  with a full-court international press, Iran doesn't feel compelled to compromise. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2986.98s)]
*  MS. NULAND I have about five minutes left, so let me go just to the woman in the back right there. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2992.42s)]
*  Oh, yes, right there. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2997.86s)]
*  Q Hi. I just wanted to get a sense of what is the current state of play with respect to the military [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=2998.9s)]
*  sites. My understanding is that under the JCPOA there is access as a technical matter, but that [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3008.66s)]
*  the IAEA has not actually sought access thus far, and there have been statements by Iranian [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3015.14s)]
*  officials that they wouldn't provide such access if there were requests. If such a request were made [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3022.3399999999997s)]
*  and they denied access, it sounds like that would be a material breach. Could someone comment on this? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3029.06s)]
*  MR. KURTLOWSKI Well, the thing is relatively simple. The IAEA has spoken out and made it [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3034.42s)]
*  abundantly clear that they consider military sites to be part of these sites that they could [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3039.54s)]
*  inspect if necessary and that they haven't seen a reason to visit them as yet, but that if they [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3043.54s)]
*  need a rose, the IAEA sees no reason why they couldn't do it. Should the U.S. do it or others [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3048.9s)]
*  push the IAEA to do it provocatively? We don't think so. Should the U.S. hold back if actually [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3055.46s)]
*  there are concerns? We don't think so, even if the Russians are particularly upset about the [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3061.3s)]
*  information that triggers such an action. So that's the specific thing about access. There is an [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3065.7s)]
*  issue out there which is, which regards to how does one interpret the implementation of the additional [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3073.9399999999996s)]
*  protocol and so on, but I think the IAEA is very clear and the U.S. is critically important in [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3079.8599999999997s)]
*  steering the IAEA towards that position that says military sites are in. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3086.3399999999997s)]
*  I just want to add. Okay, let's try to squeeze in two more. Go ahead in the front here. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3090.8199999999997s)]
*  Matt Gang, I'm a contractor with the Foreign Service Institute. So kind of touching on the point of how [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3097.46s)]
*  historically when Iran has been domestically divided is when they've been most willing to [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3103.46s)]
*  capitulate come to the table. So the United States President right now has voiced very clearly [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3109.7s)]
*  that he has opposed this deal on the campaign trail. He said it's the worst deal the United [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3115.62s)]
*  States has ever gotten into, maybe ever. And as we approach the kind of congressional, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3119.06s)]
*  you know, public aspect of this, I can see a possibility where he individually uses social [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3125.54s)]
*  media or other platforms to kind of speak out on this issue and attempt to undermine it so he can [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3131.06s)]
*  kind of fulfill his promise to dismantle it. How do you kind of see that affecting the Iranian [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3135.86s)]
*  domestic sphere? And could it have possibly affected enough to where Iran could kind of [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3142.26s)]
*  itself unilaterally take actions to undermine the deal or to let it unravel? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3148.7400000000002s)]
*  I think frankly anything President Trump says is dead on arrival in Iran. No U.S. President has [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3154.5s)]
*  alienated the Iranian public more since 1979 for several reasons. One is the visa ban, the travel [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3163.1400000000003s)]
*  ban. The second is that people in Iran for the most part, the vast majority, want the nuclear [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3170.1s)]
*  deal. They want to be integrated with the outside world. They don't want to be isolated. And third, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3176.42s)]
*  and this was, you know, it sounds like a minor point to everyone in the room, but for Iranians [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3181.14s)]
*  it's a big deal calling the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf, you know, because the national [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3185.7s)]
*  conniption in Iran. And so I think that he has very little leverage. He only has really the [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3190.02s)]
*  impact to affect the popular mood in Iran negatively, not positively. Kind of, as I said, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3199.78s)]
*  vindicated in some ways the cynicism of the Iranian regime that America is arrogant and can't be [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3204.98s)]
*  trusted. Now I think the danger is if Congress passes new sanctions or we decide to block the [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3210.42s)]
*  Boeing deal to Iran, which was part of the nuclear deal, Iran will rightfully be able to say that [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3219.94s)]
*  America has violated its end of the agreement and that they will then reconstitute their nuclear [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3226.42s)]
*  activities. Now my speculation is that they won't go from zero to 100. I'm not going to say we're [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3233.86s)]
*  going to go after nukes and kick out the inspectors because they know that then that will exercise [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3239.38s)]
*  international public resolve. But they'll go from zero to 10. And we talk about in the report some [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3243.94s)]
*  of the things they may do in that context. But it would be enough to cause enormous concern in [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3250.6600000000003s)]
*  Washington and Tel Aviv that Iran is moving forward with this nuclear program, but not enough to get [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3258.1800000000003s)]
*  China and Russia and many of our European partners sufficiently exercised to counter it. So it becomes [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3264.5s)]
*  in some ways the worst of both worlds because Iran becomes in some ways unencumbered by [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3270.9s)]
*  the nuclear deal. And then they're moving forward with the nuclear program, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3277.06s)]
*  but international unity doesn't exist. Anyone in the back just to be equal here? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3281.94s)]
*  Who had a question? Okay, why don't we go to you? Go ahead. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3288.66s)]
*  Thank you very much. Very interesting session. Firas Mordad with IHS. My understanding of the [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3295.54s)]
*  Iranian nuclear program was that it was more or less a negotiating tactic in the sense that [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3300.9s)]
*  we've been hearing since the late 90s that the Iranians are two years away from a nuclear weapon. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3305.62s)]
*  And you either believe that all the intelligence agencies that said that [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3312.1s)]
*  they didn't know what they were talking about or that the Iranians chose not to go after a weapon [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3316.82s)]
*  while building up the knowledge. The deal, as I understand it, allows them to continue, obviously, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3321.6200000000003s)]
*  with ballistic missile program, but it also allows them to continue researching methods to enrich [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3329.06s)]
*  faster without actually building up a stockpile of enriched material. So does the deal in effect [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3334.5800000000004s)]
*  take us from a position where the Iranians would break out and build two, three, four weapons [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3341.6200000000003s)]
*  to a position where Iranian breakout at the expiry of the deal would involve building 20, 30, 40 weapons? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3346.82s)]
*  It would take more than time that Jen would allow us to actually go through the history of the Iranian [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3357.86s)]
*  nuclear program. But let me say going through different phases, I would say that as a rule of [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3362.82s)]
*  thumb, there was a period until 2002 that they actually pursued a nuclear weapon as such. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3367.78s)]
*  After that, they wanted to keep a nuclear option, a very robust option, so that even if they are [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3373.14s)]
*  being attacked or whatever, they would be able to resuscitate it relatively quickly and at a more [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3379.54s)]
*  advanced stage of development. Lots of things got into the question. What they didn't have was a [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3383.54s)]
*  credible nuclear energy program. And the program that they have in place doesn't meet any of the [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3389.62s)]
*  international state benchmarks on what the peaceful nuclear energy ought to look like, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3396.34s)]
*  and it makes no economic sense whatsoever. But that doesn't mean that one cannot live with such [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3400.2599999999998s)]
*  an activity if it were in general for peaceful purpose. I'm not saying promote it because some [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3406.3399999999997s)]
*  people don't like nuclear energy and some people do, but on the whole this is so if the Iranian [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3410.98s)]
*  nuclear activity in the peaceful domain, which by the way Europe had taken upon itself as an extension [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3415.8599999999997s)]
*  of the JCPOA to work on, was and there are pieces of this where Russia and China come in and so on, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3421.14s)]
*  to continue to develop in a serious way, I would say whether regardless whether it's done on its [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3428.02s)]
*  merits or to divert its scientists from doing the first nuclear activity, let them do it. I wouldn't [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3433.7000000000003s)]
*  say that I would encourage them, but I wouldn't be uptight about it. Can I add a couple things? One, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3439.1400000000003s)]
*  just on that two-year time frame, like the way Iran, the whole calculation of understanding how [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3443.78s)]
*  close Iran is to a bomb is based on the fact that the number is always, if tomorrow they were to [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3448.5800000000004s)]
*  drop any pretense of not going for a nuclear weapon and just do everything they had to do to [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3454.34s)]
*  get to a nuclear weapon, then in two years they could have won. That's usually how breakout time [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3458.7400000000002s)]
*  is calculated, using everything that they've got. And so their whole strategy over years and years [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3463.78s)]
*  and years, as Ellie said, was to sort of leave themselves an option by continuing to build out [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3467.78s)]
*  this infrastructure that got them closer and closer without sort of hitting the starting gun, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3471.94s)]
*  which forces you to start doing things that very clearly becomes apparent to everyone, including [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3476.5s)]
*  intelligence agencies, the international community, others that they're going for a bomb. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3481.22s)]
*  So it was, I'm not sure it was just a negotiation, it was an option. And they were, you know, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3484.8999999999996s)]
*  like when I started at the Pentagon, they were a year away. And when I left a few years later, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3490.1s)]
*  they were about two months away. Like this number that, you know, and now under the deal, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3494.18s)]
*  they're a year away again. That's, I think, just important to understand that number. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3497.8599999999997s)]
*  And the other thing is, I think it's really important to understand, is Iran is still in [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3501.2999999999997s)]
*  perpetuity under the agreement committed to being in the additional protocol. It is committed, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3504.74s)]
*  no country in the world has ever developed a nuclear weapon under the nose of the additional [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3509.7s)]
*  protocol. The notion, I think, that I think, as Ellie talked about, that any of us really see, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3514.1s)]
*  and I don't even think the negotiators believe this, although, you know, if Ambassador Burns was [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3519.46s)]
*  here, we could ask them again, if we really saw, you know, when the sunset provisions come off, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3523.7799999999997s)]
*  it's just a free for all. I mean, that's not how nonproliferation agreements and international [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3528.74s)]
*  agreements generally work. Most effective, you know, international agreements do have sunsets, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3532.74s)]
*  and if they're working, you renew them or you find something new to do. So I just don't think [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3536.9s)]
*  that there is a scenario where the world allows that to happen or a scenario where the United [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3541.54s)]
*  States is okay with that of just, we go by the nuclear agreement, and then as the provisions [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3545.86s)]
*  come off, they're just, it's a free for all. So I just, so I don't think that the deal actually [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3550.1s)]
*  legitimizes or creates that situation at all. All right. Well, thank you to our panel. Thank [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Fpup1Oozok&t=3554.6600000000003s)]
