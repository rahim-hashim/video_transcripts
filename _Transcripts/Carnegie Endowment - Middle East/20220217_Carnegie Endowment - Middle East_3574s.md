Video Description: In the Middle East, climate change poses an unchecked threat as it sharpens socio-economic inequalities and further jeopardizes the plight of vulnerable communities already challenged by poor governance, water shortages, and conflict-induced displacement. While some Middle East governments have been proactive in the transition to renewable energy, there is still much more they can and should do to adapt to the far-reaching effects of climate change through better governance and inclusion.

Join a panel of distinguished scholars for a wide-ranging discussion on the cascading impacts of climate change in the Middle East and how governments and citizens can prepare.

# The Middle East's Climate Change Wake-Up
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [February 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=0.0s)]
*  Good morning from Washington, D.C. I'm Fred Wary, a senior fellow in the Middle East program [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=29.88s)]
*  at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=34.2s)]
*  It's my pleasure to welcome you to this panel on the Middle East climate change wake up. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=36.92s)]
*  A World Bank report issued just last month identified the Middle East as one of the regions [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=42.64s)]
*  of the world that is most vulnerable to climate change and indeed the cascading effects of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  to include water scarcity, rising temperatures, desertification, migration, food insecurity, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=55.7s)]
*  are expected to amplify a number of long-standing governance problems in this region, sharpen [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  inequalities, socioeconomic inequalities, and also pose new disruptions. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=69.54s)]
*  Among those most impacted by these stresses will be the region's marginalized populations [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=75.34s)]
*  and vulnerable populations, including those living on rural and urban peripheries, migrants [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=81.62s)]
*  and refugees, women, workers in the informal and tourist sectors, to name but a few. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=87.7s)]
*  And indeed, this list could grow given the effects of climate change. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=94.54s)]
*  In light of these effects, it's clear that the region's elites need to wake up to the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=98.7s)]
*  threat of climate change, as implied by the title of this panel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=103.9s)]
*  Many governments in the region have certainly made pledges to go green through renewable [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=107.92s)]
*  energy and innovative technologies, and some have taken steps in that direction. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=112.84s)]
*  Still others are hosting upcoming climate summits, namely Egypt and the United Arab [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=119.88s)]
*  Emirates. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=125.12s)]
*  But are they doing enough? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=126.12s)]
*  What obstacles remain? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=128.48s)]
*  And more importantly, how can governments integrate mitigation measures with innovative [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=130.8s)]
*  socioeconomic and governance reforms to help their societies adapt and withstand climate [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=135.84s)]
*  stresses? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=141.8s)]
*  And specifically, what are the policies they need to pursue to protect the most vulnerable [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=143.4s)]
*  parts of their population? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=147.88000000000002s)]
*  To tackle these questions, I'm very pleased to welcome our distinguished panel of experts. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=150.86s)]
*  You have their bios. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=156.46s)]
*  I'll make this introduction very brief. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=157.46s)]
*  Olivia Lazard is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=160.32000000000002s)]
*  Myisha Allam is a non-resident senior fellow at the United Nations University Center for [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=164.56s)]
*  Policy Research. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=169.88000000000002s)]
*  Manal Shahabi is an applied economist and a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  for Energy Studies, among other affiliations. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=177.84s)]
*  Olivia, I'd like to start with you by quoting something that you wrote for Carnegie's Middle [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  East blog two years ago. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  You argued that, quote, climate change is not simply a matter of energy transition, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=190.44s)]
*  but rather it's a matter of profound political and socioeconomic transformation. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=196.2s)]
*  Unpack for us what you mean by transformation in the Middle East context and really help [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=203.48s)]
*  us to understand the systemic effects of climate change. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=208.0s)]
*  Thank you, Fred. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=213.32s)]
*  And thank you for having me on this panel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=214.32s)]
*  It's really wonderful to be here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=215.32s)]
*  I'd like to focus maybe on two things to try and unpack this quote. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=217.8s)]
*  The first thing is that, and this is the lay of the land, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=222.44s)]
*  The climate transition is about mitigation and adaptation simultaneously. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=226.52s)]
*  Mitigation requires, obviously, a shift away from fossil fuel energy, which has a significant [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=234.10000000000002s)]
*  series of impacts for countries in the Middle East that have been fossil export dependent [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=239.94s)]
*  for over many decades. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=246.28s)]
*  But it also requires essentially important changes in the way that we conceive of economic [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=250.16s)]
*  activities, mobility, industrial output, and production, such as steel and cement, for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=255.4s)]
*  example, which concerns a number of countries such as Egypt and the Middle East. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=261.32s)]
*  And it fundamentally is about transforming the political economy of any country in the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=266.76s)]
*  Middle East and creating, therefore, winners and losers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=274.44s)]
*  This is the fundamental rule about political economic changes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=277.88s)]
*  The question, therefore, will naturally be how much of a plan each country develops to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=281.88s)]
*  accompany changes or if populations we'd be left to cope with shocks and losses associated [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=286.76s)]
*  with that transition. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=293.88s)]
*  Then there is the adaptation part. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=295.58000000000004s)]
*  And here we just need to give a few numbers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=297.6s)]
*  On average, from a global perspective, we've already reached a 1.1 degree Celsius increase [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=301.54s)]
*  in terms of our global warming pathway. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=307.78000000000003s)]
*  In the Middle East, that translates for the next decade, starting now, as a 2 to 2.5 degree [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=310.58000000000004s)]
*  Celsius increase on average every year, not cumulatively, but over the next decade. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=319.26s)]
*  That means what? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=328.42s)]
*  That means that we're going to have more water evaporation rates, more drought, more fires [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=329.98s)]
*  in certain parts of the Middle East, such as the Levant. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=335.98s)]
*  We're going to have more flood events, particularly in ecologically degraded areas, more energy [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=339.14000000000004s)]
*  provision disruption. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  We've seen that in Iraq, for example, last summer. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  We're going to have less soil productivity, which is going to decrease the ability, essentially, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=349.1s)]
*  of some countries to export some of their agricultural outputs. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=353.38s)]
*  More generally, we're going to have differentiated impacts regarding the levels of heat, the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=357.58s)]
*  levels of climate vulnerability, the climate hazards. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=364.66s)]
*  Less livability in urban centers, more disruptions in livelihoods, particularly in rural centers, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=369.38s)]
*  more urban migration, more inequality, more different types of issues around crime, health [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=374.94s)]
*  issues, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=380.94s)]
*  And therefore, potentially, and this is one of the main concerns, widening trust gaps [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=382.86s)]
*  between state institutions and populations. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=387.14s)]
*  And for some countries, we're going to see essentially more investments in technological [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=391.26s)]
*  and infrastructure solutions that may actually worsen ecological resilience. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=396.58000000000004s)]
*  And I'll get to that in a minute. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=403.3s)]
*  And therefore, have a potential to heighten all of the above rather than mitigate essentially [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=405.38s)]
*  the impacts of climate change. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=411.66s)]
*  So while dealing with a transition pathway that must be economy wide in the Middle East [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=413.22s)]
*  and across the world, states in the Middle East will have to understand, preempt and [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=417.98s)]
*  plan for all of these disruptions that are already baked into the system and whose impacts [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=422.98s)]
*  we can predict, but only to a certain extent. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=428.54s)]
*  So there is a level of uncertainty that we need to prepare for, which means preparing [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=432.22s)]
*  fiscally for this, having a long term vision and having, therefore, an ability to adapt [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=438.38s)]
*  to granular ways in which climate hazards will manifest. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=444.06s)]
*  So the key question is how Middle Eastern states will design policies for resilience, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=447.74s)]
*  how they will define resilience and for whom, and how they will seize potentially the transition [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=453.54s)]
*  as an opportunity for political, economic and social change. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=459.94s)]
*  And now very quickly, the second aspect that I'd like to focus on is the fact that there [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=464.38s)]
*  is another challenge at play beyond mitigation and adaptation. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=469.58s)]
*  The MENA region as a whole is the one region that demonstrates that climate change did [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=473.74s)]
*  not just start with the Industrial Revolution, but way before with the establishment of sedentary [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=478.78s)]
*  civilizations and what we call the anthropogenic change of landscapes. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=486.18s)]
*  By accelerating land conversion and initiating greater rates of erosion of land, we started [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=491.86s)]
*  releasing excess greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=498.76s)]
*  And we also broke, and this is important, other types of ecological interdependencies, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=502.74s)]
*  such as, for example, the biotic pump, which is responsible for water corridors and for [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=508.18s)]
*  bringing in water from marine ecosystems into terrestrial ecosystems, cycling water and [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=515.54s)]
*  ensuring a certain level of water availability in aquifers, drinkable, quality water. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=521.0200000000001s)]
*  But the Middle East is a region that is largely desertified as a result of complex factors [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=529.1800000000001s)]
*  that have happened over centuries and that led to ecological depletion. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=533.46s)]
*  It is this ecological depletion that makes the Middle East more vulnerable to climate [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=538.5400000000001s)]
*  change. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=543.46s)]
*  The implication of that is twofold. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=545.5s)]
*  One, climate change is not just a matter of energy outputs and carbon dioxide. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=547.98s)]
*  It is part of a complex crisis of ecological exhaustion and unsustainable resource use. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=554.54s)]
*  The second implication is that re-strengthening ecological interdependencies and working with [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=561.82s)]
*  regenerating degraded ecosystems is absolutely crucial. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=568.42s)]
*  It's not just a matter of storing carbon. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=573.0s)]
*  It's really about bringing back water levels up to a level which is linked with human rights, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=575.82s)]
*  with human security. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  It's about restoring soil productivity and therefore food security, as well as the basis [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=583.9s)]
*  of economic activity for any society. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  And it's about buffering against the extremes that are coming in as a result of climate [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=590.94s)]
*  change. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=594.54s)]
*  I'll stop there because I think I'm done with my time, but we can come back to it afterwards. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=595.54s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=602.22s)]
*  Yeah, that was a pretty dire picture. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=603.22s)]
*  You painted and definitely appreciate the nuanced discussion of what constitutes ecological [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=605.8199999999999s)]
*  depletion. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=611.4599999999999s)]
*  Maisha, I want to turn now to you to follow up on that, especially some of the themes [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=612.4599999999999s)]
*  that Olivia mentioned regarding human security and resilience and again, for whom much of [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=618.42s)]
*  your work has focused on the intersection between climate change, inclusion and social [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=625.2199999999999s)]
*  justice. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=630.34s)]
*  And in particular, you've written about how gender parity could be impacted by these [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=631.34s)]
*  cascading effects of climate change. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=637.14s)]
*  How do we think about vulnerability to climate change right now in the Middle East? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=640.1800000000001s)]
*  Who is vulnerable now? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=644.7800000000001s)]
*  Who will become vulnerable? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=646.5400000000001s)]
*  And what can governments do to address this? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=648.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, first, thank you so much, Fred, and to the Carnegie Endowment for International [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=651.02s)]
*  Peace for convening us. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=656.34s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be speaking alongside Olivia and Manal. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=658.06s)]
*  You know, there's growing recognition that climate change is one of, if not the biggest [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=661.8599999999999s)]
*  challenge facing humanity today. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=666.9s)]
*  And we know, as Olivia was alluding to, it's a risk multiplier for so many other issues [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=669.14s)]
*  such as armed conflicts, which are at their highest level in 30 years, or displacement, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=675.18s)]
*  which is at its highest level in recorded history, or extreme poverty, which is increasing [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=680.3399999999999s)]
*  for the first time in 20 years, thanks in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=685.78s)]
*  However, one reality that's often overlooked is that accelerating climate change doesn't [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=691.1800000000001s)]
*  affect everyone equally. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=698.3s)]
*  Rather, climate change affects marginalized social groups in distinct and in some cases, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=700.38s)]
*  disproportionate ways. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=706.1s)]
*  Indeed, it exacerbates pre-existing inequalities, including, as you pointed, Fred, to [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=708.42s)]
*  gender inequality. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=715.22s)]
*  And women and girls are affected by climate change, not least because they comprise the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=717.1s)]
*  majority of the world's poor, the world's unbanked, the illiterate, the underemployed, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=723.82s)]
*  and those who are uniquely vulnerable to violence within and outside the home. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  And this is an area in which some of my research has previously focused. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=735.4200000000001s)]
*  And I think the really important thing to note here is that sex disaggregated, evidence-based [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=740.9799999999999s)]
*  research and inclusive policymaking are absolutely critical. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=746.3s)]
*  So I led a study a few years ago on the intersection of climate change and gender, looking at [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=749.66s)]
*  three key areas, human rights, security and development. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=755.4599999999999s)]
*  And more recently, research suggests that, you know, as climate related extreme weather [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=760.3s)]
*  events such as droughts, floods and fires threaten lives and livelihoods, there are [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=766.74s)]
*  a myriad ways in which they shape the micro level coping mechanisms which are uniquely [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=771.98s)]
*  harmful to women and girls. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=778.5s)]
*  These include, for example, rising levels of child marriage, surges in gender based [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=780.58s)]
*  violence and the withdrawal of girls more than boys from school. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=786.22s)]
*  I want to be clear about something. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=791.82s)]
*  These are statistical correlations and much more research is needed in order to better [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=793.58s)]
*  understand the causal pathway that links accelerating climate change to gender [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=799.7s)]
*  inequality. And that means getting a better understanding of the needs, aspirations and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=805.1s)]
*  experiences of communities on the front lines. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=810.7s)]
*  Among the issues that I believe must be on the forefront of the agenda for climate change [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=814.46s)]
*  adaptation and mitigation when it comes to these issues are land tenure for agricultural [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=819.42s)]
*  production. Again, something that Olivia briefly touched on, water scarcity and supply [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=826.06s)]
*  management and renewable and safe resources of household energy. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=830.9799999999999s)]
*  These three issue areas are especially pertinent across the Middle East in the face of [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=836.3s)]
*  extreme temperatures, prolonged doubts and the long history of dependence on non-renewable [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=842.14s)]
*  energy sources. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=847.86s)]
*  Now, they aren't the only issues that matter by any means, but I want to focus on them for a few [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=849.62s)]
*  different reasons. So let me offer some examples. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=856.14s)]
*  Women comprise the majority of the world's small hold farmers and grow more than half of all the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=859.66s)]
*  world's food, yet own only about 10 percent of the world's land. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=865.34s)]
*  And that's at the global level. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=870.1800000000001s)]
*  Now, across the Middle East, the problem is particularly acute with extremely low levels of [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=872.0600000000001s)]
*  women's property inheritance and land ownership. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=878.94s)]
*  So as climate change exacerbates land insecurity and food insecurity, as you can imagine, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=882.0600000000001s)]
*  there are cascading effects that come with that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=887.82s)]
*  To move to another issue area, one study found that 82 percent of rapes treated at clinics in West [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=890.74s)]
*  jar four occurred while women and adolescent girls were traveling farther and farther [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=896.86s)]
*  distances to collect water and firewood. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=901.74s)]
*  Now, this is not unique to that context. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=904.5s)]
*  We know that when it comes to water supply and water as a resource management at the [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=906.62s)]
*  household level, that task and that responsibility disproportionately falls on women and [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=913.38s)]
*  adolescent girls. And so as they are having to travel farther and farther to collect [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=919.74s)]
*  whether it's water, whether it's firewood, the risks that they're exposed to, you know, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=926.78s)]
*  increases and are amplified. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=931.74s)]
*  We also know, for example, that human trafficking increases by almost a third in areas that are [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=934.78s)]
*  affected by a climate related disaster. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=939.94s)]
*  And it raises another important point, which relates to climate induced displacement. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=943.34s)]
*  Both rural and urban populations are having to migrate due to the adverse impacts of [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=948.7s)]
*  climate change, whether within or across borders. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=954.34s)]
*  And in some contexts, climate related disasters are the singular reason for migration, while in [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=957.94s)]
*  other contexts, climate change is at play alongside other factors such as worsening armed [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=963.86s)]
*  conflict or declining economic opportunity. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=968.58s)]
*  Yet, national and international policy frameworks are inadequate to protecting those who [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=972.5400000000001s)]
*  migrate due to climate change. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=978.22s)]
*  And we know, for example, that, you know, existing the existing Refugee Convention doesn't [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=981.42s)]
*  recognize climate change or anything related to it as grounds for that kind of movement and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=987.5s)]
*  protection that comes with that kind of movement. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=993.38s)]
*  And so there's a real need to kind of update whether it's the national, regional or [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=995.42s)]
*  international level policy frameworks and measures to to address these issues and most [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1000.3s)]
*  importantly, to ensure that there's protection for those vulnerable groups. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1006.1s)]
*  And again, this issue warrants particular attention in the Middle East, especially in [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1010.86s)]
*  countries like Iraq, Syria and Yemen, where communities are coping with multiple risk [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1015.5400000000001s)]
*  factors such as conflict, food insecurity and extreme heat. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1020.5400000000001s)]
*  I'm glad to see that inequality and insecurity, including of women and girls, are [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1024.74s)]
*  increasingly, even if inadequately, on the agenda of international conferences such as [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1030.22s)]
*  the Berlin Climate Security Conference or the UNFCCC's Conference of Parties, also known [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1035.78s)]
*  as COP. But what's critical at this time is ensuring that there's increased understanding [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1041.3400000000001s)]
*  on gender and climate change is matched with targeted policies and that those policies [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1047.78s)]
*  are backed up with sustainable financing and political leadership so that commitments and [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1052.98s)]
*  rhetoric are translated into action and change. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1057.38s)]
*  There's enormous focus on the technical aspects, rightfully so. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1060.82s)]
*  And I think the point that I'm trying to emphasize in my comments is the need for equal, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1064.86s)]
*  if not as, you know, a greater attention to protection issues as well. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1069.1799999999998s)]
*  I'll maybe pause here and and in the in the in later comments, Fred, during the Q&A, I [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1075.34s)]
*  can highlight some examples of tools and policies that have been developed to address [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1083.06s)]
*  these issues. But I want to make one final point, which is I want to underscore that [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1087.3799999999999s)]
*  just because some social groups or communities are particularly vulnerable to climate change [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1093.5s)]
*  doesn't mean that they are merely victims or that they lack agency when it comes to [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1099.38s)]
*  addressing climate change. And on the contrary, I would argue that they are and should be [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1103.58s)]
*  seen as key partners whose Indigenous knowledge, experiential insight and resourcefulness [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1108.54s)]
*  are four-small multipliers when it comes to climate change adaptation and mitigation. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1114.94s)]
*  And again, I'm happy to elaborate on that further in the remainder of the program. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1119.7s)]
*  So let me hand it back to you now. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1125.46s)]
*  That was great. Yeah, terrific. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1128.5s)]
*  Very detailed and I think humanizing discussion of vulnerability, especially on gender [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1130.5s)]
*  and migration and your caveats on agency are well taken. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1136.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think you've set us up for a very good discussion on the need for inclusion with [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1140.66s)]
*  these with these local partners. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1145.14s)]
*  Manal, I want to turn to you to kind of bridge us from adaptation to mitigation. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1148.22s)]
*  And you bring the important perspective of an energy and economic specialist to this [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1153.54s)]
*  discussion. In your work, you've applied some welcome scrutiny to the green pledges of a [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1159.46s)]
*  lot of these Middle East governments, to their programs, to their ambitions. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1166.34s)]
*  If you could walk us through those commitments and those plans from a technical [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1170.78s)]
*  perspective, what are the obstacles? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1176.7800000000002s)]
*  What further steps do they need to take? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1179.1000000000001s)]
*  And also try to link those steps back to the governance issues that we discussed. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1181.14s)]
*  Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be with you here today with also alongside [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1189.5800000000002s)]
*  Olivia and Maisha and you. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1194.94s)]
*  I think your questions are really important because, as you know, the Middle East is [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1198.3400000000001s)]
*  affected by the global climate change as well as what happens domestically. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1202.06s)]
*  And I think obviously what governments can do is focus more on the mitigation [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1206.3s)]
*  domestically. I think throughout time, I think the region, the Middle East region [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1210.06s)]
*  has lagged behind other regions in what they've done to address climate change [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1214.98s)]
*  effects on their local economies, but also really with minor things, so to speak, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1220.6599999999999s)]
*  like having really good public transportation system, for example. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1228.18s)]
*  The linking it back to the title of today's seminar with or today's discussion [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1233.3400000000001s)]
*  on the wake up, I think we also have really seen very mostly last year, just a [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1238.5s)]
*  noticeable wake up from with these green pledges that you've mentioned. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1243.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think I'd like to kind of maybe break them into two. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1248.26s)]
*  So there's the energy transition projects and technologies and then the regulation [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1251.1000000000001s)]
*  side of things where we're seeing new commitments on the regulatory side. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1256.5400000000002s)]
*  So I'll walk you through briefly both of these. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1260.6200000000001s)]
*  The first one on the energy transition projects and technologies, obviously [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1262.46s)]
*  moving away from fossil fuels, which Olivia had touched upon to renewables, which I [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1268.14s)]
*  think also Maisha had briefly mentioned, that is probably the most straightforward [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1272.74s)]
*  way to move, I guess, towards cleaner economies, but also because the region has [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1280.18s)]
*  some of the best renewable energy sources globally. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1285.74s)]
*  In this space, we've seen energy importing economies being really ahead of energy [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1289.86s)]
*  exporting economies. So Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, for example, have had substantial [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1295.26s)]
*  portion of electricity generated being from renewables, 15 percent in Jordan up to [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1301.22s)]
*  around close to, I believe, 34 percent or so in Morocco. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1305.86s)]
*  But then if we look at hydrocarbon economies of the Gulf Cooperation Councils, for [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1310.38s)]
*  example, we see the numbers significantly lower, even though they are the countries [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1314.26s)]
*  that have more of the financial means, so to speak, to fund energy or renewable [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1319.54s)]
*  projects. In energy importing economies, energy security is a driving force, so to [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1326.26s)]
*  speak. But in GCC plans, we've seen renewable energy being part of the larger [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1332.5s)]
*  visions, the grandiose economic diversification visions that these countries have. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1338.22s)]
*  But really, the development has been quite slow and we're looking at targets ranging [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1342.66s)]
*  from 15 percent in the case of Kuwait up to about 45 percent by 2050 in the UAE. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1347.58s)]
*  But the penetration of renewables to date is average of one percent across these [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1354.74s)]
*  states with the exception of the UAE, which has gone from two percent to about seven [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1361.46s)]
*  percent only last year. And part of that was accelerated use of also nuclear energy. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1364.9s)]
*  So that's kind of more on the renewable side. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1371.02s)]
*  But then there's also what we've seen really accelerated and new in the last year [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1374.18s)]
*  also, or a couple of years, as expansion of cleaner energy projects or energy [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1380.02s)]
*  transition projects, so to speak. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1386.6200000000001s)]
*  And we see probably the biggest player in that is the hydrogen sphere. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1388.3s)]
*  And hydrogen has basically a very important role or potential role, I should say, in [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1392.7s)]
*  the energy world in general. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1398.3799999999999s)]
*  And it's a potential export source for particularly energy exporting economies [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1403.9s)]
*  currently, I should say hydrocarbon exporting economies. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1409.78s)]
*  We've seen massive projects being announced and some have already started in Oman, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1412.86s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1419.3799999999999s)]
*  We also have seen some hydrogen strategies been adopted in Saudi Arabia, for example, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1422.26s)]
*  last year there was the first shipment of ammonia that was produced from hydrocarbons, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1427.22s)]
*  so oil and gas, but with reduced carbon using carbon CCUS technologies or carbon [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1432.8600000000001s)]
*  capture utilization and storage technologies. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1439.3s)]
*  And that was shipped to Japan. So we're seeing starting to see really improvements on [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1441.42s)]
*  that. So towards cleaner energy projects. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1445.42s)]
*  But we're still, as you said, I have in my research kind of put a bit of scrutiny on [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1448.5800000000002s)]
*  these green targets, so to speak, because the target really is still far from where [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1452.94s)]
*  we are at the moment. And I want to go from that to the second part of what's been [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1460.18s)]
*  happening on the regulation side. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1464.14s)]
*  Last year, almost a year ago, in April of last year, there was the announcement of the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1466.74s)]
*  Net Zero Producers Forum between Norway, Canada, the US, but also from the Middle [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1471.74s)]
*  East, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1478.1s)]
*  And then leading up to COP26 in November, we've seen quite surprising net zero pledges [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1480.42s)]
*  by the UAE by 2050, by the Emirates by 2050, as well as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain by [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1488.3s)]
*  2060. And these are particularly for hydrocarbon producing economies, which have very [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1493.18s)]
*  high per capita emissions and energy consumption domestically. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1499.3s)]
*  This is really a large move, a wake up call, so to speak. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1503.34s)]
*  And then there was within that a focus of what is called the circular carbon economy. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1507.5s)]
*  So using basically different technologies with a focus on the hydrocarbon sector. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1512.46s)]
*  So we're not going away from oil and gas, but basically using technologies to capture [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1518.06s)]
*  the carbon and either sort in the ground or find other alternative solutions for it. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1522.7s)]
*  So these are obviously very important pledges. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1527.74s)]
*  And but still, the question remains, are these countries then able to achieve these [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1531.5400000000002s)]
*  pledges, particularly when we're still looking at the hydrocarbon sector, oil and gas [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1538.3000000000002s)]
*  being the main driver in the economy and also in the new energy transition projects? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1542.9s)]
*  And I probably should also mention that these projects are important for the Gulf [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1548.18s)]
*  States because they can continue to export energy products. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1554.3000000000002s)]
*  But also, there's been an opportunity for importing economies like specifically Morocco [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1558.42s)]
*  and Egypt, because they also have green renewable energy resources to also kind of [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1564.18s)]
*  have an opportunity to be part of this new hydrogen, if I can call it a revolution of [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1570.7s)]
*  sort, while also exporting that. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1577.14s)]
*  So there's an economic opportunity in both parts of my I shouldn't say criticism, but [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1579.54s)]
*  it's a half criticism of these projects as well. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1586.22s)]
*  They are really important, but they're also, in my opinion, focusing particularly on [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1588.26s)]
*  the export side of the energy supply chain. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1592.94s)]
*  But then we also, I think, still need to kind of bring it back to what is actually [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1597.18s)]
*  happening in these economies and to extent to which then these clean energy [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1601.82s)]
*  technologies can be part of the domestic energy supply chain and also help decarbonize [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1607.02s)]
*  the economy domestically. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1612.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's not just the export side that is being decarbonized, but also the domestic [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1614.14s)]
*  side. And also part of the importance of having these plans become realized and [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1618.1000000000001s)]
*  become successful is we need really development and deployment of successful and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1624.8200000000002s)]
*  commercial carbon capture and utilization and storage technologies, which is now till [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1631.0600000000002s)]
*  now, it's you know, that's still more of a dream than a reality and also ensuring that [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1637.42s)]
*  these projects are profitable, but also that there is environmental and regulatory [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1641.82s)]
*  infrastructure to support their successful deployment as well as support domestic [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1647.1s)]
*  decarbonization. And I might just want to end now as my time is probably closing to [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1652.1399999999999s)]
*  an end on then what then should these governments do in order to basically [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1657.86s)]
*  accelerate on the technology front and the regulatory front as well adaptation and [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1663.4199999999998s)]
*  mitigation when it comes to climate change. I think there is a large scope really for [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1669.62s)]
*  lots of reform reform at the micro and macro level. Possibly I would highlight three [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1673.9799999999998s)]
*  most important ones. The first one I think is really at the macro level. I think we need [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1679.82s)]
*  a reframing, so to speak, of how we look at the energy transition and at the [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1684.8999999999999s)]
*  environment. As I mentioned, these energy transition projects and these technologies [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1689.1799999999998s)]
*  are geared toward the export side. If you look at it really from a nuanced perspective, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1692.86s)]
*  and I think we need to look at sustainability more of a holistic approach where we also [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1697.1s)]
*  incorporate it in the regulation, in the new industries with economic diversification, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1702.4599999999998s)]
*  but also in domestic industries, as I mentioned. And then leading from there, I think once [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1707.02s)]
*  we have that holistic view with sustainability as an overarching theme, the second area that [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1713.58s)]
*  I think should be done is really strengthening the regulatory framework, particularly in [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1718.78s)]
*  areas of carbon and the environment, all the CCUS technologies, but also the private [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1725.34s)]
*  sector because the private sector for the longest time has been really the main [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1731.54s)]
*  profiteer, so to speak, of the volunteer states and also not really involved in driving a [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1735.82s)]
*  cleaner economic diversification and enhancing economic resilience, excuse me, and [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1743.74s)]
*  efficiency. So there's a large scope there. And then the last part that I think is really [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1749.3s)]
*  critical is energy reform and energy reform really of the larger sense of it, not just [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1754.3s)]
*  with subsidies, particularly with the private sector, but also strengthening and [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1761.58s)]
*  accelerating renewable energy share in the domestic power generation, but also [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1766.94s)]
*  strengthening, I think it was mentioned by one of the ladies before me, but also the [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1775.3s)]
*  public transportation system and also increasing investments or incentives for [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1782.42s)]
*  investments in clean technology and then how that then kind of translates back to the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1787.3000000000002s)]
*  overall culture of and how we look at basically our attitudes, so to speak, if you [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1791.46s)]
*  will, when it comes to energy and how it relates to our consumption of energy, but also how it [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1797.9s)]
*  relates to the environment. And I'm happy to take any questions if you have at this stage. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1802.5800000000002s)]
*  Great. Yeah, that was terrific. I mean, a great panoramic dive into the nuances of this [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1808.7s)]
*  transition and the plans and especially appreciate your distinction between the export and [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1816.18s)]
*  the import models and also the need for domestic issues as well. I'd like to turn it [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1820.54s)]
*  over for questions from the audience, a reminder to audience that you can ask a question to [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1829.18s)]
*  our panelists using the live chat function on YouTube. And so with that, we'll open it up for [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1836.78s)]
*  questions. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1844.74s)]
*  Let me start out with a follow up question. I guess it's really, this was anticipating my [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1845.34s)]
*  question, Olivia. This is really pertains to all of you, this argument and again, correct me if [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1870.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm reframing this incorrectly, but this notion that authoritarian systems are best equipped to [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1875.74s)]
*  address climate mitigation because they're insulated from domestic pressures, they're free [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1882.3000000000002s)]
*  from domestic blowback. And I wonder in a region like the Middle East with such a proponent [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1889.9s)]
*  of authoritarian systems, do you find that gaining traction and are some of the statements that [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1895.98s)]
*  we're seeing, the pledges, the summits geared toward preserving that system? And I guess the [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1901.98s)]
*  follow on question is, when we talk about inclusion, how far are you willing to go on that? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1909.02s)]
*  What does climate change necessitate a real rethinking of the political order in the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1915.02s)]
*  of the political order in these countries really? Olivia, I guess we'll start with you. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1923.26s)]
*  Thanks, Fred. So your question generally applies to a debate that's been ongoing for years [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1932.1399999999999s)]
*  as per the capacity between or the effectiveness, comparative effectiveness between democracies and [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1939.5s)]
*  authoritarian states to go ahead with the transition. Maybe I'd like to first point out [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1945.1s)]
*  that we have at least one expert in the Carnegie network that has written extensively about this. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1950.78s)]
*  His name is Richard Youngs, and he's done really tremendous work about this. And some of the things [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1956.3799999999999s)]
*  that he demonstrates is one, if we look comparatively around the globe at this point in time, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1961.98s)]
*  the most convincing transition plan that we have is actually one which has been offered by the [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1969.42s)]
*  European Union. So granted, it's not a state, it is a regulatory power, and it is a sort of coalition [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1973.8999999999999s)]
*  of states. But it is, you know, the best version essentially, or the closest version that we have [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1979.9s)]
*  to what a democratic force can essentially do in order to provide some incentives, some guidance [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1986.8600000000001s)]
*  as to how to go about the transition, knowing that it's far from being perfect. There's still a lot [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=1995.02s)]
*  of things to do, but it is the most convincing plans that is out there in terms of, you know, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2000.38s)]
*  nationally determined contributions, even though that's not nationally determined at this point. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2007.34s)]
*  The second thing is when we talk about the capacity of authoritarian states, usually people [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2011.58s)]
*  tend to jump directly to China. So China is indeed a fairly convincing state and actor in response [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2017.5s)]
*  to climate change, but not necessarily as a result of really understanding and integrating the way in [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2025.8999999999999s)]
*  which climate change is about and has already changed everything, but as a result of a demand [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2034.06s)]
*  driven incentive. China identified already decades ago that there would be a surge at some point in [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2041.8999999999999s)]
*  the demand for renewable energy. It is extremely well endowed in terms of the raw resources regarding [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2049.82s)]
*  rare earths and other types of critical materials that it has essentially exploited and managed to [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2055.82s)]
*  build a vertically integrated supply chain that has been the driver, one of the drivers of its [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2063.34s)]
*  economic growth. So there is a planification essentially of China as one form of authoritarian [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2069.42s)]
*  states, which is quite advanced and in terms of planning capacities, which is very much about [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2077.1000000000004s)]
*  a comparative geo-economic advantage. It is not about sort of really understanding how climate change [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2082.1400000000003s)]
*  is demanding of each and every state and each and every political constituency to really rethink [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2089.34s)]
*  the way in which we do political processes, resilience, socioeconomic planning, and therefore [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2096.1400000000003s)]
*  inclusive governance. And the very last thing about the Middle East in particular, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2101.34s)]
*  when we start speaking about forms of authoritarianism in the Middle East, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2106.3s)]
*  or how we assume that authoritarian states will have a long-term planning capacity [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2110.2999999999997s)]
*  essentially that enables them to plan for climate change. We realize essentially that in the Middle [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2119.8199999999997s)]
*  East the countries that essentially perfected the art of keeping the lid on ever increasing [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2126.7799999999997s)]
*  levels of boiling water. And this is a very, very different thing because it essentially shifts the [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2136.54s)]
*  argument and we realize that authoritarian states are actually much better at planning for short-term [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2143.2599999999998s)]
*  crisis management rather than long-term planning. So in the case of the Middle East, we already saw [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2149.5s)]
*  that with the Arab Spring, where essentially there was a number of different complex factors [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2155.82s)]
*  that overtook the capacity of state actors to really deal with a number of different grievances, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2162.06s)]
*  which had some roots in environmental issues, which then trickled into governance issues, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2170.14s)]
*  which then were also sparked in terms of socioeconomic grievances. And that's what you [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2176.22s)]
*  were saying indeed at the beginning of your introduction, Fred. At the moment, climate [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2181.18s)]
*  disruptions act as a magnifying effect of pre-existing grievances and they're going to [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2186.14s)]
*  increase over time because we're essentially undermining the capacity of societies to really [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2195.1s)]
*  function from a human rights perspective, an economic perspective, a social fabric perspective, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2200.2999999999997s)]
*  but at some point they will also start acting as profound disruptors of political and economic [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2208.14s)]
*  fabrics. And this is the part where we don't exactly know how that is going to play out [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2214.14s)]
*  and this is the part that, you know, Middle Eastern countries are certainly not looking ahead [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2219.02s)]
*  enough into the future in order to plan. And the result is therefore what Manal was also mentioning, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2225.42s)]
*  that there is an over-reliance on technological solution pathways in order to mitigate the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2230.94s)]
*  climate crisis, keep business as usual in terms of rentier state income, rather than rethink the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2238.22s)]
*  way in which we do governance, inclusion, how we understand vulnerability, how we rebuild essentially [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2246.06s)]
*  social and economic fabrics, how we strengthen ecological interdependencies through ecological [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2253.3399999999997s)]
*  design and environmental regeneration, and how we replan essentially for new types of territories [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2258.62s)]
*  and territorial administration as well. Terrific, no that was great and the questions are now [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2264.78s)]
*  rolling in and I'm going to bundle a couple of them. Manal, these two are for you on the GCC. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2271.7400000000002s)]
*  First question, what role does Israel play in helping GCC states with energy transition? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2278.94s)]
*  The second one is how interested are the GCC states in exporting green technologies and solutions [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2284.1400000000003s)]
*  to other states in the region? Could they lead the green transition regionally? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2290.22s)]
*  Okay, very interesting questions and also just to add before I answer them very quickly, without [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2298.54s)]
*  details to Olivia's point earlier on the previous question, I think we also need to maybe look also [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2306.8599999999997s)]
*  at the Middle East regimes with also really the incentive all regimes want to kind of stay in [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2313.98s)]
*  power so to speak, but I think also there is really the play of how that really happens is [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2319.66s)]
*  the extent to which their energy importers or energy exporters is really really affecting [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2325.58s)]
*  how they the extent to which they actually can achieve these transition energy transition plans [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2330.62s)]
*  and I'm going to use that then to kind of get into the two questions that you asked. I'll start with [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2337.3399999999997s)]
*  the second one, an exporting green transition. The Gulf states are in an interesting position [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2341.2599999999998s)]
*  because on one side they are really they have the economic incentive because in the world the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2348.94s)]
*  role of fossil fuels is declining so there's an incentive to kind of get into the energy exporters [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2355.42s)]
*  not just fossil fuel exporters and to try to get support from that through the export largely to [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2361.1s)]
*  fund the frontier state and the the big expenditures but at the same time we also see that they're [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2367.18s)]
*  really behind in the energy in the green energy transition or green energy in general. I think [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2371.98s)]
*  there's also an interesting point to to think about that green transition as I mentioned earlier [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2379.02s)]
*  really requires and depends the success of that depends on technology so the the funding of [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2385.26s)]
*  technology in the largest let me rephrase that the countries that have the largest advantage in [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2391.26s)]
*  hydrogen and in green energy technology and renewables are countries that also allocate [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2398.06s)]
*  a substantial part of their budgets to technology and R&T expenditures. In the Gulf we don't really [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2403.42s)]
*  have that at the moment so the big parts of that will really be relying on outside external [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2410.62s)]
*  technology firms for examples and partners to really drive the the technological advancements [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2416.3s)]
*  so then there is a large gap even though there is very excellent renewable energy resources in the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2422.54s)]
*  Gulf and there is financial base if you will to potentially fund large renewable and or green [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2429.82s)]
*  energy transition projects I think there is also still really the gap of one is there the will to [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2438.78s)]
*  do that but then also the second is do we actually really have R&D technologies to do that and also [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2443.6600000000003s)]
*  I think it's there is real incentive to maintain the role of the hydrocarbon and energy the current [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2449.5s)]
*  hydrocarbon sector in the Gulf in general as the main really driving economic sector in these [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2456.3s)]
*  economies so I think the extent to which they'll be able to then export green energy will really [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2463.1800000000003s)]
*  depend on whether it will fit within parts of their hydrocarbon sector and we see that very [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2468.86s)]
*  clearly you know with with the Ramco example I gave earlier it's not really driving completely [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2474.6200000000003s)]
*  green renewable based projects but really something that relies on the hydrocarbon sector itself [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2479.66s)]
*  while capturing the carbon having said that though there are big plans for green hydrogen [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2487.1s)]
*  projects in the Gulf which with international partners so there is definitely the control [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2493.8199999999997s)]
*  but I do think that they're probably my last point on that question is the Gulf states are competing [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2498.86s)]
*  against one another as well in this market so I think at some point if there is even a regional [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2507.1s)]
*  contribution within them to work together to then that this idea of maybe exporting green transition [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2513.02s)]
*  would then be be stronger because they can collaborate at the financial side but also at the [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2518.7799999999997s)]
*  technology side and potentially not really compete against one another as to whether Israel [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2524.94s)]
*  is helping with the energy transition I mean this is obviously we know that there is on the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2529.58s)]
*  political side there's a big bonding so to speak between Israel and the Gulf states but really [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2537.18s)]
*  Israel has its own issues as well I mean Israel also I didn't mention that I don't think in the [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2546.46s)]
*  my previous question comment Israel also has a net zero target as well and within Israel there [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2551.3399999999997s)]
*  is particular issues when it comes to the occupation that also the effects of that on [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2561.18s)]
*  the Palestinian people so there's also it has its own set of issues but in terms of whether Israel [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2564.94s)]
*  will help potentially perhaps in the technology front there could be potentially an area of [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2570.06s)]
*  collaboration but also the the Gulf region has larger space for the renewable [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2574.7s)]
*  really for renewable energy and also hydrocarbon resources that could be used in the energy [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2581.4199999999996s)]
*  transition that Israel doesn't have as much but that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2588.54s)]
*  necessarily a role particularly on the technology front and potential trade relations between them [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2592.22s)]
*  as well. Great. Maisha a question for you and I'm going to reconfigure it and expand it a bit. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2598.06s)]
*  The question is could you tell us about the link with democratization in the Maghreb there are [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2606.38s)]
*  social movements for access to water or against fracking for example and this is likely to increase [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2612.54s)]
*  with climate change and I want to circle back to what you said about these afflicted vulnerable [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2619.58s)]
*  populations rural populations migrants women and this notion that they're not simply victims they [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2624.46s)]
*  have agency they need to be brought into the climate action conversation you know so my question I [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2630.86s)]
*  guess picking up on this question is these movements you know social movements we we already see them [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2636.54s)]
*  in in the region you know civic activism on climate change where are they what you know what's [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2643.42s)]
*  happening with them and how can governments harness them. Thanks Fred that's a few different [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2648.3s)]
*  threads and I'll try to tie them together maybe to take the first piece and this goes to the earlier [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2655.82s)]
*  conversation on authoritarian regimes and versus democratic states and and the and climate change [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2661.1000000000004s)]
*  adaptation and mitigation. I think one of the things that's really important to state is whether [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2667.82s)]
*  you're talking about the Middle East region or beyond you know the difference between optics and [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2672.86s)]
*  reality right so you see a lot of lip service being paid to climate change adaptation and [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2677.74s)]
*  mitigation and pledges being made of all kinds whether that's at COP or at the national level [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2683.74s)]
*  or otherwise and I think follow through is really ultimately where we can get a better sense of to [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2690.8599999999997s)]
*  what extent is any of this going to be happening and happening at a pace that is necessary in order [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2695.74s)]
*  to avoid the worst effects that we can see coming and I will say that you know authoritarian regimes [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2702.7s)]
*  tend to be exclusionary by their very character right and tend to not emphasize protection of [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2709.2599999999998s)]
*  populations marginalized or otherwise and so you know call me a skeptic when it comes to this [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2715.98s)]
*  question of who's it going to serve and how well is it going to go when it comes to this democratic [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2721.58s)]
*  versus authoritarianism. You know even to take the example of China which was referenced earlier [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2726.86s)]
*  and again I know this is this is outside the Middle East but there's a quite a chasm between [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2732.6200000000003s)]
*  what China has been doing within China in terms of the reforms that it's that it's making for [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2737.6600000000003s)]
*  climate related purposes versus the investment in its role in regions beyond China's borders [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2744.1400000000003s)]
*  including in Africa and Southeast Asia right so that discrepancy I think is very telling in terms [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2749.42s)]
*  of this question of which types of regimes are better equipped. I think you know it would it [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2755.02s)]
*  would be a disservice to all of us to act as those states are unitary actors that only this issue [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2760.38s)]
*  only affects what happens within their borders when we know that if there perhaps there's no [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2767.5s)]
*  issue that is more borderless than climate change so so I wanted to make sure I made I made that [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2771.74s)]
*  point. I think in terms of and I noticed in the in the comments there was questions about [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2776.94s)]
*  democratization and also about peace a few things are important to note including in the Maghreb [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2782.54s)]
*  and the Sahel and in the Middle East which is yes we have to pay attention to the role of [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2789.02s)]
*  governments and the role of states but it's equally if not as equally important to pay attention to [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2793.7400000000002s)]
*  the role of non-state armed groups as well as non-state unarmed groups so so somebody alluded [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2799.58s)]
*  to the importance of engaging with the private sector and and developing public private [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2806.3s)]
*  partnerships so that's incredibly important the other side of that equation is the role of non-state [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2811.82s)]
*  armed groups especially as there are as there is political upheaval and there are territories [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2819.34s)]
*  often rich in natural resources that are ungoverned by states and that are either governed or [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2826.0600000000004s)]
*  controlled in some way shape or form by non-state armed groups when we think about climate change [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2831.74s)]
*  adaptation and mitigation policies it's not enough to just look at the role of states because [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2836.7s)]
*  there are going to be regions that are going to be changing in certain ways and others that are not [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2841.4199999999996s)]
*  just by virtue of who controls that territory and controls the population therein. Now with respect [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2845.8199999999997s)]
*  to you know social movements and and and mobilization for water I mean I think this is [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2851.8199999999997s)]
*  an incredibly important question you know even under repressive conditions across the Middle East [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2857.1s)]
*  we have seen enormous and North Africa we've seen enormous you know social mobilization for a whole [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2862.94s)]
*  host of issues among them access to clean water safe housing and coping with you know whether [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2871.02s)]
*  it's desertification, soil erosion or so on and so forth it may not these movements may not always [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2880.46s)]
*  use the language of climate change adaptation and mitigation that we are so often prone to do in the [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2887.66s)]
*  West but just because the vocabulary may not be the same doesn't mean that the core issues that [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2893.66s)]
*  are being challenged demanded discussed aren't there is an overlap and I think that's that's [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2898.62s)]
*  really important to to be paying attention to as well. I think the last thing I'll say just to come [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2905.1s)]
*  back to migration for a second is we are seeing cross-border migration which is important to be [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2912.14s)]
*  paying attention to as I mentioned earlier in my earlier comments when it comes to international [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2919.18s)]
*  policy frameworks but and you know the World Bank has done extensive work on this what is also a [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2923.3399999999997s)]
*  real factor is internal migration within countries not just from rural to urban areas but also [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2929.1s)]
*  within those and you know there we we face a real challenge where when it comes to internal [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2937.9s)]
*  displacement and protection of internally displaced populations that really falls on the states [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2944.54s)]
*  individual states right and and and so how do we integrate an understanding of climate sensitivity [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2951.34s)]
*  into that the lens through which we see those issues I think is a real challenge and an [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2958.46s)]
*  opportunity before us and then Fred you had also asked about kind of examples of policies or tools [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2964.06s)]
*  that have been developed particularly when it comes to the inclusion of women and the integration [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2971.42s)]
*  of gender sensitivity and so maybe just to highlight the example of climate change gender [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2978.7799999999997s)]
*  action plans which are which are a policy tool that have been developed over the course of the [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2983.1s)]
*  last at least decade I think in some some cases more than a decade these are policy frameworks [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2987.58s)]
*  that are developed at the national level often in partnership with both international NGOs as well [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=2993.58s)]
*  as IGO so IUCN UNEP UNDP so on and so forth to help at the national level governments understand [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3000.22s)]
*  the intersection and take an intersectional approach when it comes comes to climate change [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3009.74s)]
*  and when it comes to gender equality now I think the most important thing to say on that front [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3014.62s)]
*  is just as with international commitments what ultimately you know I think is a measure of [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3020.62s)]
*  progress is to what extent is their implementation and in order for implementation to be feasible [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3026.46s)]
*  to what extent is their budgeting and resource allocation behind those frameworks you know one [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3031.42s)]
*  of the things that I think again is important for us as scholars as practitioners to be paying [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3037.42s)]
*  attention to is how much of it is a tick box exercise in developing a policy framework [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3042.8599999999997s)]
*  or a plan or whatever it is and follow the money is there resourcing attached to it because if it's [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3048.38s)]
*  not then it's really not much more than lip service or much more than signaling so healthy [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3055.5s)]
*  skepticism I guess is the undercurrent of my comments for this for this portion back to you [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3062.3s)]
*  yeah it's a theme running throughout the panel I think so I've got a very short question that [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3069.6600000000003s)]
*  can hopefully be answered briefly because there's there's a couple questions I want to say for the [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3076.3s)]
*  end this is regarding these upcoming summits so anyone can take this how can countries namely [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3080.54s)]
*  Egypt utilize the next seven months to prepare for COP 27 and what regional priorities should [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3090.2200000000003s)]
*  be in advance of the November conference [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3097.66s)]
*  Olivia yeah um I'm tempted to focus on two big things the first is trying to make sure that [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3104.22s)]
*  food systems is brought back into the conversation at COP 27 because it was not there at COP 26 [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3114.14s)]
*  and it was a big um a mission particularly when it came to method pledges and um and how to [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3121.18s)]
*  cooperate on that um it's important for a number of reasons as Mayesh I was mentioning because it [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3129.2599999999998s)]
*  essentially links a global challenge to uh sort of micro processes uh socioeconomic empowerment [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3135.5s)]
*  and as I was also mentioning sort of a new type of territorial administration and questions [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3144.94s)]
*  fundamentally about what development looks like and what economic development pathways look like [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3151.82s)]
*  in a climate disrupted world and food systems are a huge part of the answer we need to start looking [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3157.42s)]
*  into how we re-complexify food systems how we shift away from monocultures how we ensure food [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3164.46s)]
*  resilience and security and how we do so whilst as I was mentioning sort of rebuilding ecological [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3173.34s)]
*  integrity and what we call water retention landscapes so it's about making sure that [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3179.82s)]
*  agriculture once again uh participates or is part of the solution and Egypt has a very strong uh [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3185.26s)]
*  sort of historical uh role to play from a symbolic perspective but also you know has a very strong [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3192.86s)]
*  voice due also pertinent to recent history regarding the Arab Spring [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3200.22s)]
*  and an interesting fact that you know not so many uh people know um is that Egypt is one of the [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3206.9399999999996s)]
*  countries that is considering at scale regeneration projects in the Sinai Peninsula um and this is [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3214.06s)]
*  actually quite rare and at scale ecosystem regeneration also needs to be part of the [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3221.8999999999996s)]
*  conversation and is connected to food system rethinking or redesigning the second part is [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3226.78s)]
*  around climate finance obviously at COP26 there was a huge element and it was a turning point [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3232.94s)]
*  during the two weeks of negotiations it's not uncommon but COP26 marked a new era of conversations [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3239.5800000000004s)]
*  and negotiations regarding how negotiations between the so-called global north and global south [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3248.1400000000003s)]
*  will take place and climate finance is not just a matter of financial volume it is also a matter [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3254.2200000000003s)]
*  of determining exactly how you invest it for good mitigation and technological innovations as Manal [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3262.38s)]
*  was mentioning and for really good adaptation programming and budgeting and there is a huge [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3268.6200000000003s)]
*  number of question marks here because I was talking to a number of countries at COP26 asking them a [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3275.26s)]
*  very simple question do you know what adaptation looks like in your context a lot of countries [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3281.74s)]
*  don't know so there is a need for more research into what adaptation looks like effective and [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3288.4599999999996s)]
*  granular budgeting and investments that also include in this this relates to my issues point [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3295.3399999999997s)]
*  that is very much related to how do we empower communities and how do we build essentially [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3301.8199999999997s)]
*  social resilience as well as active agency of people in redesigning their relationship [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3307.18s)]
*  to their landscape to their state to each other etc etc so it's about using essentially the whole [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3315.1s)]
*  conversation about climate finance in a way that collects you know information about what [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3320.8599999999997s)]
*  good adaptation looks like around the world what thresholds you know we are looking at because [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3325.1s)]
*  adaptation at 1.5 degree is not going to be the same if it's you know at two degrees and how we [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3329.8199999999997s)]
*  essentially sort of you know build a global platform almost a collective intelligence [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3335.9s)]
*  for how to do good adaptation in the future in a way that is profoundly connected to mitigation so [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3341.7400000000002s)]
*  Egypt has a lot of work to do in the last in the next seven minutes right could I could add to that [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3346.78s)]
*  really quickly um just on the climate finance issue because also climate finance as a as a topic [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3351.82s)]
*  hasn't really been well defined so there's a lot of work really even on that front so I think for [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3357.82s)]
*  the release it's also very important to have that finance helping them because if we remember and [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3362.54s)]
*  I don't think this was mentioned not really some of the largest contributors to climate change [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3369.5s)]
*  globally even though they're one of the most affected as a region so there's also this [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3373.58s)]
*  the fact that they they're the exposure that climate change has on their economies largely [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3378.54s)]
*  by long back magnitudes exceeds their own direct effect on climate change so finance is going to [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3384.62s)]
*  be very very important I think for Egypt as well as the subsequent one in the UAE. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3392.7799999999997s)]
*  And if I could just jump in two quick points um the first relates to Olivia was and thank you so [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3397.98s)]
*  much Olivia for emphasizing food security which I had meant to do and I noticed in the questions [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3405.1s)]
*  from the audience there was a comment or a question specifically on Yemen and I think Yemen [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3410.54s)]
*  is the perfect example where you can see I mean acute food insecurity has been accelerating for [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3415.42s)]
*  a few years it's been sharply or dramatically worsened by the pandemic and we also know that [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3423.1s)]
*  it's very closely linked with armed conflict and an environmental degradation and Yemen is in many [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3428.7s)]
*  ways the perfect example of that now the comment in the in the or the questions in the comment [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3433.82s)]
*  was about water supply and water running out and I think water is one of those issues where it's [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3438.7s)]
*  hard sometimes to grasp what that looks like and what it means and one of the things I always like [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3444.62s)]
*  to say is pay attention to food insecurity because yes the the the conditions of famine are of course [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3449.3399999999997s)]
*  impacted by armed conflict and all of that but it's also about access to water and you can tell [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3455.66s)]
*  just how bad that issue is going to be how much is going to be worsening by the way in which [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3461.98s)]
*  food insecurity changes so that was just one quick comment I wanted to make the other both Manal and [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3468.78s)]
*  Olivia touched on the importance of models of adaptation and mitigation and understanding [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3475.9s)]
*  what works and doesn't work and that's important at the national level but I would just add one [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3482.54s)]
*  other thing which is when we think about models of global governance when it comes to climate [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3486.78s)]
*  change adaptation and mitigation and environmental protection more broadly there's a real there is a [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3492.6200000000003s)]
*  real issue of fragmentation and so I think there as well there needs to be much more research [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3498.46s)]
*  understanding to figure out why is it that for certain issues like you know chloro-fluorocarbons [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3504.1400000000003s)]
*  we're seeing a certain amount of international cooperation and global effective global governance [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3511.18s)]
*  while for others whether it's greenhouse gas emissions or something else we're not and how [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5GHyZGziSM&t=3517.4199999999996s)]
