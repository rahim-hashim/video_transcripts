*  Thank you very much Kadir for the kind introduction and I'm also very grateful to you [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=142.92000000000002s)]
*  for the invitation to address this conference which is on a topic that is, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  has been of abiding interest to me for many years and I just want to kind [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=161.82000000000002s)]
*  of mention upfront how important that I think the research that you've done [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=167.52s)]
*  with this project is and the sorts of gaps that it helps to begin to fill. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  In the time that I have this afternoon, there's essentially three things that I want to do. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=176.88s)]
*  There was originally only one thing that I was going to do but the hazard of going [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=183.4s)]
*  at the end is that you've sat through all the other presentations and you get ideas [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  and there's things you want to respond to. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  So I will kind of deliver my official remarks which is going to be something [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=192.1s)]
*  of a retrospective evaluation of where and how Islam has figured [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=200.52s)]
*  in U.S. foreign policy making over the years. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=206.06s)]
*  Certainly towards the end of the remarks, getting into some of the more practical [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=209.46s)]
*  and tactical questions with respect to governmental engagement with religious authority. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=213.78s)]
*  You heard from my former colleague Sean Casey this morning about the work, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  some of the work that we did in the Office of Religion and Global Affairs [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=223.58s)]
*  at the State Department and I do want to kind of drill down in a little bit more detail [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=226.38s)]
*  on some of the points and questions that he raised in that context. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=231.74s)]
*  The two other things that I want to do briefly are because the question of Saudi Arabia [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=237.22s)]
*  and the ongoing discussion and processing of what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could possibly [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=245.0s)]
*  have meant when he said that Saudi Arabia is going to return to moderate Islam and having [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=250.92s)]
*  like Anel just returned last night from Saudi Arabia myself, I can't resist kind [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=256.2s)]
*  of saying my little piece on that whole question. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=263.04s)]
*  And then finally, in the vein of again hopefully encouraging our good friends [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=265.8s)]
*  at the Luce Foundation to continue to support this work, I wanted to talk a little bit [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=272.78s)]
*  about some opportunities and avenues for future research. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=277.05999999999995s)]
*  Things that we know that we don't know to hopefully kind of sketch out some ideas [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=281.52s)]
*  about what a future research agenda in this area looks like. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  I think it's fairly conventional to say that Islam became a subject of US foreign policy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=296.06s)]
*  in 1979 with the Islamic Revolution in Iran. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=305.12s)]
*  And by subject I mean that was the moment at which Islam appeared to be a thing [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=312.54s)]
*  that US foreign policy had to contend with in a systematic fashion. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=316.96s)]
*  It is of course not in any sense the first time that Islam and considerations [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=323.36s)]
*  of Islam have figured in US foreign policy making. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=329.12s)]
*  You know, it's possible for example to, you know, if you go back [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=333.98s)]
*  through declassified State Department cable traffic dating back to the 1930s and 40s, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=337.28s)]
*  you can see the US Embassy in Egypt trying to kind of figure out what this thing, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=343.14s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood that Tariq Massoud talked about, what is it, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  how should the United States think about it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=352.91999999999996s)]
*  Certainly, and this is I think the untold story, at least untold in a systematic fashion, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  where Islam fit into US Cold War geopolitics. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=364.08s)]
*  Because it is certainly the case that the United States during much [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=368.14s)]
*  of the Cold War actually viewed Islam as a usable and useful thing, as a counterbalance, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=371.58s)]
*  a countervailing force to the spread of global communism. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=378.64s)]
*  In that sense, you know, we talk a lot about Saudi Arabia's support for the export [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=382.36s)]
*  of Wahhabism around the world from the 1960s onwards. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=389.97999999999996s)]
*  Much of that activity was undertaken with the firm support, encouragement, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=393.96s)]
*  and in some cases direct collaboration with the US government, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  including some of its kind of covert arms. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=405.28s)]
*  So for example, the Muslim World League, one of the kind [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=408.46s)]
*  of leading peristatal organizations responsible for Saudi-funded dawah [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=412.36s)]
*  over the last half century, this is an organization [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=417.7s)]
*  that amongst its many activities supported the publications of Islamic magazines [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=421.5s)]
*  around the world, including in countries where socialist and communist parties [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=426.74s)]
*  and groups were trying to make headway. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=431.12s)]
*  And the US government, I think, viewed those publications as a sort of very useful accessory [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=434.04s)]
*  in its own broader Cold War policies. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=442.12s)]
*  And so I think that's absolutely kind of something that we need [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=444.72s)]
*  to study and understand more about. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=447.92s)]
*  1979 as a year is going to kind of figure quite prominently in my remarks. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=451.34000000000003s)]
*  For those of us who study the intersection of Islam and politics, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=458.04s)]
*  1979 is of course one of the kind of watershed years, right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=461.42s)]
*  It's the year of Iran's Islamic Revolution, of course. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=464.36s)]
*  It's the year of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=467.24s)]
*  And just kind of telegraphing ahead somewhere that I'm going to go in a moment [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=471.0s)]
*  when we circle back to Saudi Arabia is, of course, the year of the Grand Mosque seizure. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=475.68s)]
*  And I think 1979 is useful because it precisely allows us to get a sense [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  of this rather ambivalent Janus-faced approach that the United States took [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=486.85999999999996s)]
*  to Islam in its foreign policy. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=492.21999999999997s)]
*  Because more or less simultaneously in the early 1980s, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=493.94s)]
*  we have the United States viewing Brandeis Tala Khomeini and the political Islam [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=498.58s)]
*  that he represents as this enormous threat to US interests [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=506.58s)]
*  and national security equities. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=513.68s)]
*  At the same time as the United States is beginning to fully [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=517.26s)]
*  and enthusiastically support a wide range of Islamic forces and causes that are converging [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=520.92s)]
*  on Afghanistan in order to push the Soviets out of that country. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=528.16s)]
*  So we have this sort of simultaneous, almost schizophrenic political Islam is something bad [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=533.5s)]
*  and dangerous and political Islam is something useful and usable. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=538.1999999999999s)]
*  And I would contend that in various ways that that tension has continued to be present [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=543.06s)]
*  and to persist in US foreign policy even if the specific forms of it have changed. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  Really, you know, it's the post 9-11 period that I want to kind of leap to now. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=556.0s)]
*  There's interesting detours that we can take and I'm happy to kind of talk about it [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=563.26s)]
*  if you want later in the period that we have for open discussion of the evolution [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=567.7800000000001s)]
*  of US policy towards Islamist movements, kind of more mainstream Islamist groups [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  like the Muslim Brotherhood because policy thinking [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=579.74s)]
*  that regard has evolved enormously over the years. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=582.9000000000001s)]
*  But, you know, that's a whole session or several unto itself. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=587.0s)]
*  But because so many of our presentations this morning, I think, did, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=593.8199999999999s)]
*  and Sean Casey's remarks did kind of engage with the specific problematiques posed [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=598.14s)]
*  to US foreign policy by the aftermath of 9-11, that's where I want to kind [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=605.02s)]
*  of concentrate the next section of my remarks. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=609.64s)]
*  And, you know, it's very clear that the aftermath [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=613.66s)]
*  of 9-11 initiated this kind of new phase of sort of politics of good Islam [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=617.28s)]
*  and bad Islam to use the framing of Mahmoud Mamdani's book. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=622.86s)]
*  The idea and a sort of bifurcation in US geopolitical thinking of the idea that there are [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=627.5s)]
*  out there somewhere in the world bad Muslims, you know, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=633.6800000000001s)]
*  broadly understood amongst those who kind of, you know, those with more detailed [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=636.94s)]
*  and accurate information as a very specific limited range [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=643.88s)]
*  of Salafi Jihadi movements, although in US foreign policy discourse at the time, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=651.24s)]
*  this is the sort of GW Bush administration, there were any number of groups [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=656.46s)]
*  that were working very hard exerting enormous influence on US foreign policy thinking [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=659.94s)]
*  to kind of convince American policymakers that Al-Qaeda [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=664.58s)]
*  and the Muslim Brotherhood are essentially the same thing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=667.8s)]
*  That any form of politicized Islam is something that inexorably leads to a world view [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=671.5s)]
*  and behaviors that we had come to identify with Al-Qaeda and later ISIS [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=679.1s)]
*  because we've seen a return to that dynamic around the rise of the Daesh. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=684.72s)]
*  And, of course, the flip side of that was the idea that well, maybe, and this is where we do start [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  to get to questions of religious authority. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=695.6800000000001s)]
*  It's the idea that there's these bad Muslims out there pumping, you know, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=697.36s)]
*  bad Islamic messages around the world through tendrils and networks and narratives. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=701.4000000000001s)]
*  And so, you know, we need to identify the good Muslims that can sort of, you know, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=706.1s)]
*  provide a counterbalance to that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=710.24s)]
*  And that, you know, that work was well underway, I think, most clearly embodied [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=712.08s)]
*  by the now rather infamous 2005 RAND Corporation report, building moderate Muslim networks, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=716.72s)]
*  you know, which was essentially a sort of full-throated endorsement of the idea [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=723.5600000000001s)]
*  that Sufis are cuddly and kind and peaceful. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=726.46s)]
*  And if we were to undertake a robust effort to fund them and amplify their voices, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=731.66s)]
*  these Sufis are the ones that would be able to defeat the Salafi jihadis. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=739.0600000000001s)]
*  Again, you know, for those of you who are versed in religion and Islam and these issues, you know, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=743.2s)]
*  you realize immediately how ridiculous of a proposition that is. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=751.28s)]
*  But, you know, these are the kinds of ideas that were actually getting some level of traction [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=755.58s)]
*  in policymaking circles at the time. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  This is also mid-2000s when we had the beginning of what I now like to refer [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=767.24s)]
*  to as declaration culture, right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=772.6600000000001s)]
*  This is a series of efforts sometimes with, often with strong governmental support behind them [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=774.94s)]
*  to convene religious scholars to issue grand statements that affirm the moderate nature [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=782.3199999999999s)]
*  of Islam and reject the views and the motivations and agendas of the radical groups. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=788.8399999999999s)]
*  You know, so we have the Amman message. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=797.7199999999999s)]
*  We have the, you know, a common word, you know, and we've had a whole series of these kinds [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=800.4s)]
*  of statements since that continue up to this present day. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=806.18s)]
*  And I mention them because this sort of, the persistence of this declaration culture [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=809.28s)]
*  and this sort of tolerance symmetry phenomenon, you know, where we see every few months somewhere [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=814.36s)]
*  in the Gulf religious leaders convene to kind of issue some statement [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=820.26s)]
*  about how there should be peace in the world. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=824.58s)]
*  And the governments have then sponsored that, use that to kind of show off their credentials as, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=826.62s)]
*  you know, supporters of pluralistic, moderate progressive approaches to religion, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=831.54s)]
*  even as they continue to bomb hospitals in Yemen. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=838.28s)]
*  So we have this sort of idea that there is hearts and minds in a war of ideas going on, you know, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=841.56s)]
*  at the time of the Georgia W. Bush administration, the sort of search [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=848.56s)]
*  for these moderate Muslims, and then comes the Obama administration, the one that I served in. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=852.02s)]
*  And, you know, you'll remember the sort of signature hallmark moment here being Obama's much [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=858.66s)]
*  vaunted speech in Cairo in the summer of 2009, subtitled A New Beginning [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=863.76s)]
*  with Global Muslim Communities, right? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=869.46s)]
*  This was the sort of Muslim world version of the reset button, where the United States was going [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  to declare a new way of engaging with Islam in its conduct around the world, you know, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=876.74s)]
*  very deliberately and distinctly understood by those who were the makers of this approach [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=887.5799999999999s)]
*  to be a direct kind of polar opposite to the previous George W. Bush administration's approach. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=894.88s)]
*  I think the sort of chief direction, orientation of this new, of this pivot, if you will, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=901.9s)]
*  is not found primarily in the Cairo speech itself. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=911.68s)]
*  The Cairo speech is its most sort of detailed statement, but the kind of best [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=914.0799999999999s)]
*  and encapsulation of it comes in a speech that Obama gives in Ankara, actually, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=917.4s)]
*  to the Turkish National Assembly in the spring of 2009, you know, which is mainly a speech [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=921.8s)]
*  about the importance of the U.S.-Turkish bilateral relationship. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=927.54s)]
*  Towards the end of the speech, Obama, you know, decides if he's going to say something broader [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=930.52s)]
*  about Islam and the Muslim world, and he essentially says that from this moment forward, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=935.16s)]
*  U.S. engagement with Islam and Muslims will cease to be about primarily terrorism and security, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=939.9599999999999s)]
*  and will instead be about partnership. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=945.9399999999999s)]
*  The idea that Muslims and Americans should be working together to achieve great things [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=949.04s)]
*  in the realm of human development. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=953.56s)]
*  So a lot of focus on the empowerment of women and education and research and entrepreneurship. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=954.8199999999999s)]
*  All wonderful good things shall flow from this. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=960.5799999999999s)]
*  And so then Obama gives the Cairo speech later in which he says in the first half [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=963.3s)]
*  of the speech some really ambitious and quite revolutionary things with respect [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=967.66s)]
*  to U.S. foreign policy around the question of Iran, support for democracy in the Middle East, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=972.46s)]
*  peace between Palestine and Israel that really got a lot of people excited. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=978.12s)]
*  Recall he was, you know, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, arguably essentially for that speech. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=984.76s)]
*  And I began to worry shortly after this speech was given about something [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=990.26s)]
*  that gave me a little bit of disquiet in the whole way [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1001.3s)]
*  that something called global Muslim communities were being framed and talked about as something [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1005.4599999999999s)]
*  that U.S. foreign policy was suddenly becoming very interested in. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1011.68s)]
*  Even if the sort of intentionality behind it, even if the kind of normative valence [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1015.18s)]
*  of this new American approach was positive, was about reaching out and embracing [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1023.0799999999999s)]
*  and hugging this global Muslim for collaboration and partnership. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1026.92s)]
*  What gave me disquiet was the fact that for the first time the United States was essentially [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1031.74s)]
*  constituting an entire world religion as a subject or an object of its foreign policy making. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1039.18s)]
*  So one of the things that the U.S. government did later that same year in 2009 is [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1045.6s)]
*  to create at the State Department a new position called the Special Representative [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1049.7s)]
*  to Muslim Communities. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1053.44s)]
*  This is weird. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1054.52s)]
*  This is bizarre. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1056.94s)]
*  This is the first time in the history of U.S. foreign policy that the U.S. has appeared [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1058.52s)]
*  to appoint something like an ambassador to an entire world religion, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1063.96s)]
*  And consider for a moment what message is being sent by that gesture. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1068.64s)]
*  The United States government is saying that at some level there's a sense [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1073.52s)]
*  in which 1.7 billion people in the world are to be viewed, are to be engaged [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1077.5s)]
*  or to be thought of primarily in relation to their religious identity, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1087.82s)]
*  that it is somehow their religion that defines them. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1092.22s)]
*  Very worrying, right? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1096.26s)]
*  This is essentially the U.S. government projecting Muslimness of some sort [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1097.96s)]
*  onto a billion plus people who, yes, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1102.88s)]
*  if asked about their religious affiliation might identify as Muslim, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1107.28s)]
*  but where the U.S. government is telling them for all intents and purposes [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1112.32s)]
*  in our policymaking and programmatic initiatives, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1115.88s)]
*  you are a Muslim first and foremost. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1119.96s)]
*  I think what worried me about this is that the internal policy discussion of it was very much [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1124.2800000000002s)]
*  about trying to repair the damage of the Bush administration. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1129.38s)]
*  And I sort of talked about as we need to normalize U.S. relations with Muslims. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1133.3600000000001s)]
*  To my mind, if you want to normalize relations with a particular community or group of people [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1138.5400000000002s)]
*  that feel that they've been stigmatized or singled out for a period of time, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1143.98s)]
*  you normalize relations by treating them the way you treat everyone else. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1147.36s)]
*  And the way the U.S. usually treats non-U.S. persons around the world is to regard them first [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1151.9s)]
*  and foremost through their citizenship of a particular nation state. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1160.1200000000001s)]
*  But no, in this sort of new approach, Senegalese, Indonesians, Turkish people, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1165.96s)]
*  Jordanians have all become Muslim. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1173.96s)]
*  They've been turned into Muslims in the U.S. foreign policy gaze. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1178.6799999999998s)]
*  And so what worried me about this is that even though, again, even though the intention behind it was [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1182.96s)]
*  to reach out, befriend, enable partnership and collaboration, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1188.52s)]
*  there was a weird sense in which the Obama administration's Muslim engagement efforts served [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1193.92s)]
*  to, I think, reproduce a version of the same exceptionalism [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1201.66s)]
*  that had characterized the Bush administration's approach to Islam. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1209.74s)]
*  I.E., the idea that there's something about Muslims as distinct from other religious groups [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1213.4s)]
*  around the world that mean that they need their own special representative. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1218.8400000000001s)]
*  They need their own Muslim specific programming lines, right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1223.64s)]
*  And so this sort of persistence to continually exceptionalize Islam and Muslims, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1228.1200000000001s)]
*  which I think continues in various forms to this day, is very worrying to me. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1236.4s)]
*  A lot of these programs funded by the Obama administration's global Muslim engagement efforts, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1243.0s)]
*  as I mentioned, focused on things like entrepreneurship, educational development, in a sense. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1248.56s)]
*  And, you know, my concerns that I had with it, and I should add in full disclosure that my concerns [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1255.24s)]
*  by this point were rather practical and operational in that one of the tasks I was handed upon entering [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1263.32s)]
*  onto duty at the State Department in January 2011 was to kind of oversee that whole basket [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1269.44s)]
*  of global Muslim engagement programs, which I looked at with utter horror [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1276.22s)]
*  and did everything I could to shut down, writing what I thought were incredibly erudite policy memos [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1280.1599999999999s)]
*  about what was wrong with this and the sort of, you know, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1286.8799999999999s)]
*  problems with projecting essentialized identities onto people. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1290.04s)]
*  And that's, you know, this is the steep learning curve in academic entering government that, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1293.46s)]
*  you know, the reductionism, essentialism, and the projecting of identities onto people isn't terminology [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1298.08s)]
*  that works well in governmental circles. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1304.0s)]
*  So I needed to kind of find other ways of trying to kind of explain what was wrong with this. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1305.58s)]
*  And I think there were other ways that you could talk about what was wrong with it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1308.9399999999998s)]
*  One thing that was wrong with it, I thought, actually, was that there is a sense [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1313.5s)]
*  in which the U.S. government's embrace of a global Muslim engagement worldview actually [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1317.22s)]
*  at some level validated the narrative and worldview of Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, right? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1324.26s)]
*  Because it would be very much the Al-Qaeda line and later the ISIS line that, yes, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1330.94s)]
*  these people are not primarily Senegalese or Jordanian or Indonesian. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1338.0s)]
*  They are first and foremost Muslim. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1343.5s)]
*  They need to regard themselves as part of an ummah and they need to be engaged with [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1346.94s)]
*  and connected with the global struggles of their co-religionists. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1350.2s)]
*  And at some level, the United States in this approach was helping to enable [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1354.06s)]
*  that ummah identity, if you will, by kind of engaging in a new sort of global Muslim outreach effort. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1358.4199999999998s)]
*  But I think from policy point of view, what was wrong with it, you know, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1366.4399999999998s)]
*  can be best encapsulated by the conversation I had with a former colleague [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1370.76s)]
*  at the United States Agency for International Development, you know. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1375.4199999999998s)]
*  And, you know, and he was going on and on about how, you know, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1380.6s)]
*  we have these great Muslim engagement programs that are focused [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1384.48s)]
*  on fostering entrepreneurship in Turkey and Indonesia and Jordan. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1387.94s)]
*  It's amazing work. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1393.06s)]
*  And I said, you know, let me ask you something. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1394.52s)]
*  We, the U.S. government, we fund and run small business development programs in Ecuador, right? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1397.44s)]
*  He said, yeah, yeah, we absolutely do that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1403.6200000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1405.8600000000001s)]
*  I said to him, wouldn't it be weird if we called that work Christian engagement? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1406.22s)]
*  After all, the population of Ecuador is 98% Christian. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1411.76s)]
*  And he said, of course that would be weird. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1414.8600000000001s)]
*  Christianity has nothing to do with religion. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1417.9s)]
*  I said, well, why is it any less weird when we call those same programs Muslim engagement [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1420.4s)]
*  when we happen to run them in Muslim engagement, Muslim majority countries, right? [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1425.7s)]
*  What's the unspoken assumption that's being made in that entire leap? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1431.26s)]
*  So having told you what's wrong with the Bush administration's approach and told you what's wrong [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1437.48s)]
*  with the approach that the government I served in, the administration I served in, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1443.5800000000002s)]
*  let me begin to kind of wind things down by talking a little bit about my own experience [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1448.2s)]
*  of how U.S. foreign policymaking thought about figures of religious authority [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1455.38s)]
*  in the Muslim world in more recent years. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1458.8s)]
*  Because my second stint at the State Department coincided directly with, and indeed, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1460.4s)]
*  I was brought to work in government precisely on the religious dimensions [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1463.98s)]
*  of the U.S. approach to the rise of ISIS. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1469.14s)]
*  And I think it's fair to say, and I also think I should say for the benefit [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1473.7s)]
*  of my governmental colleagues, it was fully understandable that in their mind, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1477.66s)]
*  the idea is that we need to figure out, you know, how these religious leaders can be partnered [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1481.9s)]
*  with in order to discredit the religious messages [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1487.4399999999998s)]
*  and the religious interpretations being promoted by ISIS. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1495.28s)]
*  And it was very clear that, you know, in the minds of most of my colleagues in government, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1500.6999999999998s)]
*  religious authority figures were relevant in so far as they might be able [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1505.4599999999998s)]
*  to provide something akin to theological antidotes to Salafi jihadism. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1509.6s)]
*  Again, we're kind of back to a version of the Bush administration's good Islam, bad Islam. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1515.3s)]
*  That there is these bad ISIS messages being put out there about things that are supposedly [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1522.16s)]
*  in the Quran and hadith that justify the extreme acts of violence and gratuitous murder [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1527.36s)]
*  and genocide, frankly, in northern Iraq that ISIS engages in. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1533.96s)]
*  And so we need religious leaders who can clarify that those understandings [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1539.2s)]
*  of Islam are wrong. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1543.02s)]
*  And so one of the things, the first things our office was asked to do, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1545.3799999999999s)]
*  and I think Sean was a little bit more obliquely alluding to this, was to say, all right, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1548.2s)]
*  we need a list from you, this new religion office. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1552.76s)]
*  You guys are the religion experts that tell us the religious leaders that we should engage [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1555.3s)]
*  and partner with who will be able to explain why ISIS is bad and incorrect and wrong [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1559.98s)]
*  in its understanding of Islam. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1566.4s)]
*  And we were very wary of doing so for many reasons. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1568.92s)]
*  There were, in short, very good substantive political and legal reasons why the US government needed [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1579.96s)]
*  to keep some distance from appearing to support [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1588.84s)]
*  or endorse particular interpretations of Islam. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1594.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, not least of all this thing called the US Constitution where the First Amendment, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1599.04s)]
*  the establishment clause of the First Amendment, you know, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1604.6599999999999s)]
*  specifically forbids the US government from taking positions on matters of religion. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1606.8s)]
*  We can't endorse any particular interpretation of religion. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1611.22s)]
*  And there were odd ways, I think, that we got close to doing so unwittingly at points. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1614.9399999999998s)]
*  And this is where our office did on a couple of occasions kind of operate in high gear. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1620.78s)]
*  You may recall that there were a couple of occasions at the sort of height [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1624.9399999999998s)]
*  of the US counter-ISIL strategy where former Secretary of State Kerry referred [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1627.3999999999999s)]
*  to ISIS as apostates. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1632.28s)]
*  And we, you know, had to pull him aside a couple of times and say, Mr. Secretary, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1636.62s)]
*  you can't use that kind of language. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1639.08s)]
*  Why not? Well, because for the US government to label someone as an apostate suggests [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1641.56s)]
*  that the US government has a position on what constitutes the boundaries of Islam, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1646.6799999999998s)]
*  that we know who's in and who's out, right? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1650.54s)]
*  That is effectively taking a position on a matter of religion. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1653.52s)]
*  So we can't do that. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1658.64s)]
*  And I think there was some frustration because our office was very worried that, you know, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1660.32s)]
*  we were being looked at, we were being looked toward to give names, and then these people [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1667.0s)]
*  on the list that we gave them would be funded, would be, you know, flown around, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1672.46s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1677.18s)]
*  And there was already a lot of this going on. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1678.8s)]
*  There were certain figures that had stepped up in a big way to appear [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1680.44s)]
*  at US-sponsored countering violent extremism summits, you know, religious scholars [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1683.7s)]
*  of some considerable standing in kind of contemporary Islamic jurisprudence who had seemed [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1689.56s)]
*  to sign on big time to the emerging counterterrorism [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1695.68s)]
*  and countering violent extremism bandwagon that was gathering ahead of steam [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1699.96s)]
*  in Washington, DC in 2015 and 2016. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1705.04s)]
*  And I think that our offices, I think, well considered in the eyes of some failure to deliver [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1708.66s)]
*  on handing over the list of the right scholars to engage, you know, had some impact [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1718.76s)]
*  on how we were perceived because this was seen to be the foreign policy challenge of the day. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1725.3600000000001s)]
*  And damn it, why aren't you religion experts telling us the Islamic leaders [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1730.44s)]
*  who will provide the antidote? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1735.66s)]
*  Which is why, and here I think I'll echo something that Sean alluded to this morning, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1738.06s)]
*  this idea that, you know, I'm actually very glad that this research was not published while I was [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1742.78s)]
*  in government because I would have then had to engage in sort of, you know, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1748.02s)]
*  the inside the State Department policy equivalent of street fighting with my colleagues [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1752.1s)]
*  in the counterterrorism and the countermessaging and the kind of public diplomacy [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1756.76s)]
*  and communications bureaus about no, no, no, no, no, no, this does not mean that we should, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1762.0s)]
*  you know, form a firm partnership with the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar even though his numbers seem [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1769.3s)]
*  to be pretty good in order to defeat ISIS. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1775.3s)]
*  Oh, but this is research that shows that and here are these lists and, you know, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1778.46s)]
*  our line of view, it doesn't work that way. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1783.34s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1784.98s)]
*  And in that sense, I'm glad that this research didn't come [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1787.04s)]
*  out during the time that I was in government. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1791.22s)]
*  That said, I think this is incredibly important work for helping us to understand [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1794.48s)]
*  with greater specificity, you know, some of the more precise dimensions [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1805.1s)]
*  of what personalized religious authority looks like. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1813.28s)]
*  In the Muslim world, because the conversation certainly in the policy space that tends [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1816.78s)]
*  to take place in very, very abstract fashion. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1820.68s)]
*  And this idea of sort of counter narrative and countermessaging and the idea [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1828.72s)]
*  that if we have these messaging centers and there's religious scholars whose views are being [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1834.1200000000001s)]
*  amplified by these messaging centers that you kind of create a communication [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1838.82s)]
*  and discursive environment in the Muslim world that will dilute the appeal [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1842.5s)]
*  and render more inert the effectiveness of ISIS type stories and messages. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1850.98s)]
*  And I have to say that I am very skeptical that religious authority operates in that way. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1860.66s)]
*  And so this is where I'm going to put aside the kind of the Mohammed bin Salman return [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1866.56s)]
*  to moderate Islam stuff and, you know, happy to get into it [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1872.72s)]
*  if you want to do so during Q&A. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1875.34s)]
*  Instead, I want to turn to, by way of conclusion now, to talk a little bit [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1879.18s)]
*  about where our scholarship and research around these issues might want to go in the future. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1887.06s)]
*  You know, when one kind of gets at religious authority through a list of names, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1896.48s)]
*  what it doesn't tell us a lot about is the uses of religious authority. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1906.8s)]
*  And I think we need to rather than to assume that because someone carries the title of alim [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1919.5s)]
*  or sheikh or mufti that they are in an authority position to determine how a particular individual [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1926.3000000000002s)]
*  understands and makes sense of his or her religious beliefs. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1938.02s)]
*  I think asking who questions about religious authority is an important step forward [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1944.1000000000001s)]
*  and that's why I think this project has broken some important new ground. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1950.4s)]
*  Going forward, I'd love to better understand, for example, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1955.0s)]
*  questions around when is religious authority relevant? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1958.5s)]
*  What are the circumstances under which the utterance of someone carrying one [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1963.26s)]
*  of these august eminent titles actually has an impact in the world? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1966.84s)]
*  I had this phenomenal opportunity in 2006 when the good folks at the Pew Research Center [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1972.9599999999998s)]
*  that were doing a lot of polling in the Muslim world at that point called me up and said, hey, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1980.0s)]
*  a question has just dropped out of our poll and at the last minute for our next wave [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1984.34s)]
*  of global attitudes survey in 44 countries including 20 some Muslim majority countries, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1988.26s)]
*  we have the opportunity to insert a new question that will be asked and we'd like you [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1993.3999999999999s)]
*  to tell us what question you think should be asked, right? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1997.4599999999998s)]
*  This is like a social scientist fantasy, right? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=1999.4799999999998s)]
*  The juggernaut of the Pew Research Center global polling machinery being kind of offered [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2001.8999999999999s)]
*  to you to insert a question in. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2005.9399999999998s)]
*  And I said, you know what, I would love to know something about these Muslims that you're polling, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2007.1999999999998s)]
*  you know, when they want guidance in matters of religion, where do they turn? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2012.0400000000002s)]
*  We don't know anything about that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2016.96s)]
*  So we inserted in the 2006 Pew global attitudes survey, you can find it, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2018.5200000000002s)]
*  the reports are available online, we inserted a question that asked people [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2022.5200000000002s)]
*  in Muslim majority questions and it just so happened in that year, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2025.88s)]
*  Pew is doing an oversample of Muslims in Europe. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2029.0800000000002s)]
*  So we asked the question in some Muslim minority context as well [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2031.9s)]
*  which produces interesting comparison. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2035.0s)]
*  We asked people, when you are seeking guidance in matters of religion, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2037.0800000000002s)]
*  where do you turn? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2041.5s)]
*  And we didn't name names, we gave people, we referenced certain kinds of spaces, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2042.8000000000002s)]
*  certain types of sources, so the options I think we gave people were your friends and family, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2049.42s)]
*  religious leaders in your local mosque or religious institution, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2055.12s)]
*  national religious leaders affiliated with the state, so that's the official ulama [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2061.06s)]
*  that we've talked so much about today, or finally international figures that you access [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2067.32s)]
*  through satellite television or the internet. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2073.1200000000003s)]
*  So I like waited, you know, hit on Christmas for the results of this to come back [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2077.88s)]
*  and there's one very clear pattern that occurred globally, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2082.98s)]
*  because these are questions being asked in South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2088.1200000000003s)]
*  Muslim majority sub-Saharan Africa, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2092.2200000000003s)]
*  what was very clear is that the vast majority of people when seeking guidance in matters [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2094.8s)]
*  of religion in 2006 turned to friends and family or religious leaders [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2101.16s)]
*  in their local institutions, national and official level religious leaders scored very poorly. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2105.16s)]
*  And that's why some of the findings that came out of this study surprised me to some extent. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2112.2s)]
*  And I have to say, and I think this is a very relevant finding [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2120.2s)]
*  that the study offers that does directly contravene some of the policy guidance [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2123.48s)]
*  that the religion office was offering our colleagues in government at that time, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2128.64s)]
*  which was this idea that, oh, we need to steer clear of these figures of official Islam [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2132.3199999999997s)]
*  who are simply viewed as mouthpieces of the government. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2139.0s)]
*  They would never be credible voices, you know, for delivering the kinds of messages [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2141.9s)]
*  that the U.S. government would want. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2147.92s)]
*  Although the findings of this research would suggest that maybe we need to revisit that. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2150.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2155.6s)]
*  I'm still haunted at some level though by this idea that, I don't know, I just, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2156.6s)]
*  I don't think that, I don't think that most Egyptians when wanting [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2162.08s)]
*  to understand their religion turned first and foremost to the likes of Sha'uq Al-Alam [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2168.76s)]
*  or Ahmed Al-Tayyab as the person who sort of helps to steer them through their religious life. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2174.0s)]
*  So not to say that those figures aren't relevant and the fact [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2181.2s)]
*  that people endorse them does tell us something important and how they were endorsed [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2184.92s)]
*  and where those endorsements feature in relation to other sorts of figures. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2190.0s)]
*  That is relevant information to have. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2193.62s)]
*  And I guess what I'm saying is that as we go forward, I think we want to know more [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2196.14s)]
*  about what the sort of, the uses of religious authority in the realm of everyday life looks like. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2199.78s)]
*  Are people shaped by religious authority or are religious authority figures shaped by people? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2207.6000000000004s)]
*  Right? To what extent do the figures we call religious authority figures in the Muslim world [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2213.96s)]
*  and frankly in the Christian world, to what extent are they responding to market forces? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2217.3s)]
*  Knowing that there are trends at work and if they want to remain relevant, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2225.76s)]
*  and want to maintain some sense of legitimacy or popularity, they need to, to some extent, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2230.1600000000003s)]
*  reflect where the market's at in the way that they talk and do religion. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2235.92s)]
*  And finally, as a sort of trend that I noticed and I, there was at least one [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2242.2200000000003s)]
*  of those speakers this morning that alluded to it. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2246.44s)]
*  I think it was, I'm actually talking about Iran. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2248.1600000000003s)]
*  That I've noticed this trend as I kind of done comparative research around the Muslim world, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2252.32s)]
*  particularly among young people, and this is connected to the kind of proliferation [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2257.94s)]
*  of social media and the wide range of sources that one has access to has meant that, you know, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2262.28s)]
*  there's been this, I think, fragmentation, frankly, if such a thing ever even did exist, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2271.1000000000004s)]
*  of a sort of single pathway approach to religious authority where one, you know, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2278.6400000000003s)]
*  takes a single religious scholar or a single trend or madhab if you want to get [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2284.6400000000003s)]
*  into questions of jurisprudence and follows it. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2290.0400000000004s)]
*  But rather a trend towards religious eclecticism. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2293.0s)]
*  I want a little bit of this and a little bit of that. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2296.7000000000003s)]
*  I like this scholar for this. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2298.78s)]
*  I like, I think that person's Quranic recitation is fantastic. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2300.0600000000004s)]
*  And I like this person on questions of social justice. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2304.38s)]
*  And I like what he has to say about that. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2307.2200000000003s)]
*  And it's this sort of curation of a personalized religious experience that draws on a wide range [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2309.6000000000004s)]
*  of sources and a wide range of disparate sources. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2315.34s)]
*  Some of them perhaps traditionally and classically trained Islamic scholars, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2317.6800000000003s)]
*  but some of them figures like the sort of, the kind of Muslim Joel Austin, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2321.38s)]
*  Amr Khalid that Tariq referred to. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2325.26s)]
*  And, you know, you can talk about A'a Agim in Indonesia as the sort of, you know, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2329.42s)]
*  I'm not sure if Amr Khalid is the A'a Agim of Egypt or if A'a Agim is the Amr Khalid of Indonesia, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2334.32s)]
*  but their mode of operation is essentially the same. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2341.26s)]
*  A combination of self-help, 12-step programs, and pop psychology, so popular around the world [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2343.78s)]
*  with Islamic flavors and popular culture mixed into it, right? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2350.36s)]
*  And so you get people combining in their religious experience, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2356.2200000000003s)]
*  their day-to-day religious experience, a wide range of, quote, unquote, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2358.98s)]
*  religious authority sources, some of whom in theory are not supposed to work together very well. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2362.34s)]
*  Right? So I like this Sufi figure for that thing. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2370.2000000000003s)]
*  I like this Salafi figure for this other thing. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2372.6600000000003s)]
*  I like this Muslim Brotherhood person about foreign policy. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2374.26s)]
*  And it's all kind of mixed and matched and kind of this composite mosaic. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2376.88s)]
*  And it's engaged within a sort of pragmatic fashion. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2381.58s)]
*  And I think that's sort of the trend. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2385.34s)]
*  And if that's where we're going in religious life, and again, this is not limited to the Muslim world. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2387.7s)]
*  I think you could make a similar kind of comparative analysis with Christianity today. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2394.54s)]
*  I think that has profound implications for how we think about and engage with questions [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2398.4199999999996s)]
*  of religious authority and how we understand it. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2404.62s)]
*  I've already spoken longer than I intended to, so I will wrap up now and very much look forward [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2408.9199999999996s)]
*  to your thoughts and reactions and questions. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2414.04s)]
*  But thank you very much. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2416.4199999999996s)]
*  I'm Peter Humphrey, Intel analyst and a former diplomat. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2417.7s)]
*  I honestly think you're a little bit out to launch on this. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2428.7799999999997s)]
*  By your logic, we should close down the embassy to the Vatican tomorrow morning, for example. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2432.5s)]
*  I imagine that the Mithrites have a huge resurgence in the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2438.48s)]
*  And the Mithrites, they don't believe in collecting interest on loans. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2447.52s)]
*  And they're really pretty hard on women. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2452.3799999999997s)]
*  And if you ask a Mithrite what he is, the first thing he'll say is, I'm a Mithrite. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2455.2799999999997s)]
*  He won't say I'm a Roman Mithrite or a Turkish Mithrite or a Scythian Mithrite. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2461.58s)]
*  He'll say I'm a Mithrite. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2466.3399999999997s)]
*  So if you want to establish policy that makes sense toward the Mithrite community, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2468.9s)]
*  it would be nice to have somebody who's the Mithrite ambassador [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2474.7400000000002s)]
*  who knows these issues inside out and backwards so he doesn't try to do something stupid [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2479.54s)]
*  like establishing a micro lending institution in Mithrite communities. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2484.96s)]
*  Or to send women preferentially to represent US issues with the Mithrite community. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2491.4s)]
*  Unless you have those sensitivities in one individual [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2498.5s)]
*  who can counsel the rest of the State Department, I think you're really out to lunch. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2502.66s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2507.96s)]
*  No, I actually think you're in a roundabout way completely endorsing the position [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2509.4399999999996s)]
*  that I offered for the following reason. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2515.5s)]
*  And I would be the last person to suggest that we should shut [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2521.14s)]
*  down our diplomatic mission to the Holy See. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2524.94s)]
*  Not least of all because it's very conventional diplomacy. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2528.44s)]
*  The Vatican is a sovereign state and it's consistent with the US, you know, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2530.76s)]
*  tradition of having diplomatic representation of all sovereign entities. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2534.98s)]
*  And obviously as someone who enthusiastically leapt at the opportunity to join an office focused [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2540.28s)]
*  on trying to help American diplomats better understand the role of religion in world affairs. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2547.78s)]
*  I'm absolutely someone who believes that religion does matter. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2555.1s)]
*  What worried me is when I began to see particular religions and followers [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2558.1600000000003s)]
*  of particular religions reduced to a little more than their religious identity [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2564.26s)]
*  and how US foreign policy thinks about and engages with them. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2569.26s)]
*  So for example, when we were running the Muslim engagement programs, one of the first set [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2574.84s)]
*  of confirmations of the uneasiness that I began to feel is [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2579.88s)]
*  when those entrepreneurship programs that we were running in places like Indonesia [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2583.6800000000003s)]
*  and Turkey, the participants in those programs began to come up to the State Department people [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2587.54s)]
*  on the sidelines of the events and said, look, we really like the substance of this program [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2591.38s)]
*  because, you know, we are business people here in central Anatolia and we're trying to, like, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2595.56s)]
*  you know, connect to small and medium enterprises elsewhere in the region in the world [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2601.26s)]
*  and these are useful skills, but, you know, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2605.84s)]
*  do we have to be labeled Muslims before we can come into this space? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2608.5s)]
*  Why can't we just, you know, do this as entrepreneurship? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2612.3s)]
*  And people were absolutely pushing back against this tendency on the part of the US government [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2616.6200000000003s)]
*  to approach them through, label them by, and seemingly define them [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2623.88s)]
*  in relation to their religious identity. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2628.0s)]
*  They didn't. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2630.14s)]
*  I mean, if you ask them, you know, hey, you know, what's your religion, they would say, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2635.72s)]
*  I'm Muslim, but my point is that their religion was irrelevant to that particular activity. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2639.46s)]
*  They would identify themselves as a Turkish businessman, I would guess, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2646.66s)]
*  would be their first label. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2651.66s)]
*  But I'm not saying that there aren't particular groups whose religious identity has been politicized [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2655.88s)]
*  in a way that would lead them first and foremost [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2662.2400000000002s)]
*  to identify themselves primarily in relation to that. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2665.6800000000003s)]
*  And we saw that certainly around ISIS and Northern Iraq, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2668.88s)]
*  and it is absolutely vitally important for us and we did think about [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2675.1600000000003s)]
*  and engage the circumstances around that in that. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2680.5s)]
*  I'm just saying that I'm pushing back against the idea that it's helpful [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2682.96s)]
*  to approach 1.7 billion people around the world as if their Muslimness is the most relevant way [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2687.22s)]
*  to understand who they are and the things that motivate and drive their behavior. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2694.42s)]
*  I agree with a lot of what you said. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2699.82s)]
*  You know, so I am, given though that you did say all that, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2712.88s)]
*  I am kind of surprised you did write that survey question, you know. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2716.42s)]
*  So in other words, what answer were you thinking you were going to get [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2719.92s)]
*  and what kind of policy would you wanted to, let's say, for example, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2725.1600000000003s)]
*  the answer you got was that, you know, I turn to my official state, you know, person. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2729.14s)]
*  Or I, you know, what kind of policy did you want to build on that question? [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2735.54s)]
*  Because then it does seem that you're endorsing the basic enterprise of this project. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2739.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, I have a very ambivalent orientation towards this project. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2744.44s)]
*  Because on the one hand, I'm like, I love it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2749.54s)]
*  This is awesome. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2751.44s)]
*  This is my stuff. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2752.16s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh, but, you know, I'm not sure that a list [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2752.8599999999997s)]
*  of particular individuals is the best way to understand. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2755.96s)]
*  Are you really going to put Erdogan and Sheikha Mosel on that list? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2758.48s)]
*  Are they really religious authority figures? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2761.08s)]
*  You know, aren't you just creating a popularity contest if you do it that way? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2763.2s)]
*  You know, I talk, I didn't have in mind a particular policy outcome from that. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2766.8s)]
*  I wasn't engaged as a policymaker at that point. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2773.92s)]
*  I wasn't putting the question, I wasn't leaping at that opportunity with a policy use in mind. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2776.82s)]
*  I was leaping at it as a social scientist who, you know, as you, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2782.58s)]
*  I don't remember how you put it. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2787.2s)]
*  You know, these models are great to use, just don't believe in them. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2789.1s)]
*  You know, so when we got the data back, I knew there were enormous limitations, right? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2792.5s)]
*  If you have to create, you have to reduce the possible sources of, you know, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2796.66s)]
*  religious guidance to a, you know, four choices on a multiple choice question, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2801.18s)]
*  you're going to be losing a lot of context and nuance. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2807.0s)]
*  But, you know, that's part of the game that we play as social scientists. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2812.3199999999997s)]
*  This was before the rise of social media. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2816.26s)]
*  And so, because one finding from that that I didn't relate for purposes of brevity was [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2819.1200000000003s)]
*  that the one setting, global setting where there was clear, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2823.96s)]
*  where there was clear variation related to Muslim minorities in Europe, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2829.5200000000004s)]
*  where accessing figures internationally through social, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2835.94s)]
*  through internet and television was huge, particularly compared to local religious institutions [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2841.04s)]
*  and local religious leaders, quite simply, understandably, because there weren't as many. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2847.88s)]
*  In a setting where Islam is not the ambient religion, there isn't as ready access to mosques [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2851.6s)]
*  and local imams as there is in a Muslim majority country. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2857.5s)]
*  So I would love to be able to do that again now and see. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2860.9s)]
*  And I would probably, I mean, on the second, on one hand, I'd be tempted [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2863.96s)]
*  to ask the question exactly the same way to have that longitudinal piece, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2867.4s)]
*  but I think there are more nuanced ways that the choices could even be offered at present. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2871.38s)]
*  Hi. Bill Premosh, Montgomery College. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2881.58s)]
*  I'm also, excuse me, a former Foreign Service officer. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2884.32s)]
*  But you, I think this whole conference underscored the importance [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2888.1600000000003s)]
*  of understanding the impact of religious leaders and the need to understand the dynamics [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2893.4s)]
*  of religion in society and in politics. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2900.6000000000004s)]
*  I came away from your presentation with kind of the feeling that, well, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2904.1400000000003s)]
*  there's really nothing we can do as a government or as a foreign policy [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2909.3s)]
*  to influence these leaders. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2913.92s)]
*  It becomes counterproductive. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2916.94s)]
*  I mean, based on your experience, what would you recommend in terms of engagement [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2919.1s)]
*  that would have some kind of influence but not in a counterproductive way? [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2923.8199999999997s)]
*  So there are two or three elements in my mind to what a better approach [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2928.66s)]
*  in policy to these questions would be. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2933.66s)]
*  One is to focus, some of it is, one of them is a data-driven finding based on that moment I had [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2935.74s)]
*  with Pew back in 2006, which would, which still, and I persist in still believing that, you know, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2942.72s)]
*  officially sanctioned, state-sanctioned religious institutions and leaders are not the best place [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2950.12s)]
*  to start when you're trying to understand how something like the quote-unquote average Muslim [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2956.4399999999996s)]
*  understands her or his religion and the implications of religion for conduct in everyday life. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2960.7599999999998s)]
*  And that getting a better understanding of what religious authority [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2967.36s)]
*  at the local district provincial level looks like is important. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2972.28s)]
*  And at that family level, and this is where the question of women comes in very, very importantly. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2977.02s)]
*  Yes, just as in most major world religions, in Islam, it's generally not women [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2981.3s)]
*  who hold formal religious titles or hold positions in something like clerical hierarchies. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2986.8s)]
*  But women in many Muslim majority societies around the world are very influential shapers [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=2993.3s)]
*  of how people engage with and understand religion, even though they're not officially, you know, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3000.2000000000003s)]
*  generally counted as religious leaders. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3006.54s)]
*  And I think there's a whole world to that that we're only beginning to explore. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3011.84s)]
*  But even if we are staying within the realm of people that hold something akin [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3016.1800000000003s)]
*  to formal religious titles in Islam, it's different in Islam, right? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3019.32s)]
*  Because there isn't sort of a central, at least in Sunni Islam, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3022.42s)]
*  there is no centralized religious hierarchy. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3025.82s)]
*  But to get a better sense of what kind of local, provincial, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3028.5s)]
*  and frankly dissident national level religious leadership looks like, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3035.36s)]
*  not because the U.S. government should then throw money at those people or amplify their voices. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3040.4s)]
*  I can't, you know, what better way to spoil whatever legitimacy they might have [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3048.52s)]
*  than for the U.S. government to hold them up and say, wow, this is great Islam. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3053.1200000000003s)]
*  We need more of this than of Islam. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3057.6600000000003s)]
*  Obviously, that's not the way to do it. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3059.5800000000004s)]
*  That doesn't mean non-engagement. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3062.82s)]
*  That doesn't mean U.S. abandonment of this space or these questions. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3064.5600000000004s)]
*  It means that we use the leverage we have, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3067.86s)]
*  use the diplomatic leverage we have in different ways. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3071.26s)]
*  And so to my mind, that would mean, for example, in a bilateral military intelligence [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3074.02s)]
*  to military intelligence channel with the Egyptians, say to them, you know, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3080.46s)]
*  you might want to lay off this person that you have a tendency to crack down on and oppress. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3086.12s)]
*  Because even though you perceive that person as a threat to you, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3092.14s)]
*  that person is actually playing, having a useful effect in terms of holding off groups [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3096.96s)]
*  that would be even more destabilizing, right? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3102.44s)]
*  So it's a diplomatic overture that is about trying to make space for certain voices and groups [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3105.1600000000003s)]
*  to be more influential without having to fund them and hold them up [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3113.04s)]
*  and give speeches about how amazing they are. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3117.7000000000003s)]
*  It's, you know, it's a very subtle form of operation that U.S. foreign policy, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3120.1600000000003s)]
*  which tends to either want to throw money or bombs at things that it finds in the world [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3124.9s)]
*  that we're not always very good at. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3128.98s)]
*  But it's also something that our seasoned diplomats do know how to do very well. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3131.1s)]
*  And it's not easy, and it means sometimes having very difficult conversations, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3138.08s)]
*  but I think it would be a more effective way than just trying to come up with a who's who list [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3143.56s)]
*  and funding or endorsing particularly religious leaders officially. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3147.72s)]
*  Thank you very much, Benjamin Tu, another diplomat. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3158.5s)]
*  As opposed to the policy that the Obama administration, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3165.42s)]
*  the Bush administration before did of picking and choosing, our policy, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3174.22s)]
*  I think you're suggesting, and I would agree with, is talking to everyone. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3182.9s)]
*  And trying to understand and getting information [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3188.56s)]
*  and not picking winners and losers. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3192.48s)]
*  Yes. Convertly, we might do a little bit more to advance our interests, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3195.16s)]
*  but for the most part, we would be noncommittal simply talking to everybody, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3202.4s)]
*  including everybody. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3211.22s)]
*  And one aspect of our policy that hasn't been touched on our diplomatic practice is the explaining [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3212.66s)]
*  our society and our values and how we respect everybody's values, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3225.2999999999997s)]
*  irrespective of whether they are believers or not believers, Muslims, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3231.94s)]
*  Christians, and so on and so forth. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3236.18s)]
*  And the second aspect would be exchanges, personnel exchanges, which we do a lot of, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3238.5s)]
*  inviting people here to understand our society, meet with people [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3245.9199999999996s)]
*  of different communities, and so on and so forth. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3249.7s)]
*  Plus, the Fulbright Program, sending people overseas to better understand these societies. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3252.8199999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3259.7s)]
*  I mean, I am a huge fan of our public diplomacy programs [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3260.24s)]
*  and our international exchange programs. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3268.54s)]
*  I think they continue to be just thinking purely as an economist, which I'm not, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3269.9799999999996s)]
*  with respect to return on investment. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3277.66s)]
*  I think what we get from those programs is of enormous value over time. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3279.6s)]
*  And so I think they're very valuable. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3285.7999999999997s)]
*  I think the idea of engaging with everyone is much to learn and at times to express points [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3288.7200000000003s)]
*  of disagreement rather than saying, I'm not going to talk to this group, is the way forward. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3296.9s)]
*  And, you know, in that sort of engaging with everyone kind of approach, I, you know, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3302.38s)]
*  Sean referenced, you know, Bill Burns, already the keeper of this institution. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3309.02s)]
*  And one of my most valuable lessons as an amateur new diplomat, I learned from him. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3316.12s)]
*  You know, he was undersecretary for political affairs the time that I started. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3323.14s)]
*  And one of the things, my main work when I worked on, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3327.4s)]
*  for Secretary Clinton's policy planning staff was to kind of come up with a new post 2011, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3332.16s)]
*  post revolution approach to US policy towards the Muslim Brotherhood, basically. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3337.94s)]
*  That was the bread and butter of my work. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3342.62s)]
*  And an opportunity appeared for the US government to become part of a dialogue stream [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3344.8199999999997s)]
*  that had been going on for some years whereby representatives [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3351.7599999999998s)]
*  of various European foreign ministries in a sort of academic, low profile environment had been meeting [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3355.2599999999998s)]
*  with representatives of Islamist movements. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3361.3199999999997s)]
*  And so a particular government that was involved in that came to us and said, you know, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3364.06s)]
*  in light of what's going on in the region, would the US now like to join this dialogue? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3368.12s)]
*  And I, you know, sort of thought this would be a great idea. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3373.1s)]
*  Yes, of course, you know, it's clear in this new political landscape that's emerging [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3376.2599999999998s)]
*  in the Arab world that the Muslim Brotherhood, you know, is going to be a major player. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3380.06s)]
*  We have had very little opportunity to meet with people like that, you know, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3384.32s)]
*  despite the best efforts of people like Nathan who, you know, even when that was impossible, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3389.96s)]
*  found ways of creating environments where some engagement with Islamists could take place. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3395.38s)]
*  I was all for it. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3400.1800000000003s)]
*  And Bill Burns, you know, when I recommended this said, no, we're not going to do it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3401.6200000000003s)]
*  And my default gut reaction to that was, oh, this guy, he doesn't understand. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3405.3s)]
*  He thinks, you know, he thinks we couldn't be meeting with people like that. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3408.86s)]
*  And when he explained it to me, I, you know, this is where it's like, oh, God, you know, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3412.0200000000004s)]
*  who am I to think that I understand what's going on? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3415.6800000000003s)]
*  He said, no, look, we have to assume that any meeting like that will appear [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3417.4s)]
*  on the front page of the New York Times. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3420.5400000000004s)]
*  And anything in this sensitive environment in the Middle East right now, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3422.7200000000003s)]
*  where the main thing we want to emphasize in US foreign policy is that it is the people [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3426.28s)]
*  of the region who will decide their political futures. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3430.36s)]
*  Any meeting where it looks like the US government has already decided that it needs [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3433.78s)]
*  to have a summit with the Islamists will look like the US has decided that this is the group [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3437.34s)]
*  that is going to win and we want to work with them, you know. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3442.2s)]
*  And so his point was what we need is an approach to that kind of dialogue [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3446.66s)]
*  and a policy informing it that basically says the US will meet with any group, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3450.7999999999997s)]
*  regardless of its political scribe, regardless of what label is attached to it. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3457.1s)]
*  You know, we did put some, there were certain parameters that we put on it, you know, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3460.8599999999997s)]
*  that groups, you know, the group in question need to reject violence as a tool [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3466.12s)]
*  of achieving social change, they need to respect the, you know, the full rights [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3470.2999999999997s)]
*  of all citizens including women and religious minorities. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3474.98s)]
*  But other than that, we'll meet with anyone and with good reason because in terms [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3478.04s)]
*  of US engagement with the Middle East, with the Arab world, we had up to that point, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3483.7999999999997s)]
*  those of you who have worked in Middle East diplomacy will know that most of our engagement [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3488.62s)]
*  with the region tended to occur almost exclusively [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3492.94s)]
*  with political, business, and military elites. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3496.3799999999997s)]
*  We had very little contact with broader society and in this new environment that appeared [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3500.62s)]
*  to be emerging, so hopefully in 2011, it suddenly looked as if a whole range of new groups [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3507.4s)]
*  and ideological orientations were going to be relevant. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3513.1800000000003s)]
*  So yes, the US needed to meet with the Ikhwan, with the Muslim Brotherhood, and with Salafis, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3519.58s)]
*  but we also needed to meet with leftists and social democrats and workers movements [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3523.9s)]
*  that we also had neglected in our previous diplomacy. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3528.08s)]
*  Yes, to learn from them how they see the country's future and in some cases, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3531.86s)]
*  including with some of the Islamists as an opportunity to explain to them what concerns, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3535.78s)]
*  what frank concerns we have about them. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3539.9s)]
*  And so I just, I absolutely, you know, agree with that kind of broad framing [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3542.3s)]
*  of the challenge that we were faced with. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3548.2000000000003s)]
*  Great. Thank you. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3562.5s)]
*  Sure. John Anderson, independent analyst, okay, full disclosure, ex-FSO also. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3563.36s)]
*  At any rate, sort of in the aftermath of what became known in Egypt and the US about our contacts, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3574.6600000000003s)]
*  diplomatic, et cetera, with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, both prior to election [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3583.82s)]
*  of Mohammed Morsi and in that period when he sat on the throne for that period of time, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3588.8s)]
*  elaborate theories, conspiracy theories, hey, sprung up and they're still out there. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3595.84s)]
*  I mean, you know, that US, in fact, engineered the Muslim Brotherhood's takeover in Egypt. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3602.6400000000003s)]
*  Some of us think that that's quite often regime sponsored in the current context. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3609.2000000000003s)]
*  We could talk about that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3615.1400000000003s)]
*  But any case, what then is our role in terms of engagement? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3617.3s)]
*  How do we engage with our own intelligence, for example, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3623.6000000000004s)]
*  in terms of knowing who's saying what and countering that? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3627.32s)]
*  What are the possible avenues of approach? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3630.94s)]
*  Can we get on talk shows where crazy stuff is going on and, in fact, through not ourselves [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3633.88s)]
*  and our own spokesperson's, State Department and others, but locals [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3639.44s)]
*  that actually are quite interested in countering those kinds of statements, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3644.1s)]
*  conspiracy theories and others. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3648.46s)]
*  I mean, what would be our level of engagement and type after that? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3651.32s)]
*  And just one last thought. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3658.2200000000003s)]
*  Thanks very much for your whole speech and characterization of what a lot of us have felt [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3659.6s)]
*  that is that profound discomfort in terms of some of the things we've said [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3665.98s)]
*  and places we've tried to go. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3670.18s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3671.82s)]
*  I mean, with respect to a country like Egypt and, frankly, U.S. policy [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3674.12s)]
*  in the Middle East more broadly, I think the United States just has to have a really [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3677.44s)]
*  and a frank conversation with itself about what the North Star's [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3681.94s)]
*  of its longer term engagement with the region should be. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3689.06s)]
*  Obviously guided by some assessment of U.S. national interest. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3693.04s)]
*  And what I would contend is that the previous North Stars [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3698.48s)]
*  that have been the guiding principles of U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3701.06s)]
*  over the last 50 years have largely fallen away. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3706.24s)]
*  And part of the turbulence that we're going through right now is [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3709.98s)]
*  that we're not entirely sure what our interests are. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3713.24s)]
*  And I think one of the products of this is a knee-jerk reaction [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3718.34s)]
*  to scramble our way back to comfortable ways of doing business. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3724.68s)]
*  And so, and there's a number of other countries in the region [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3729.0800000000004s)]
*  that are feeling the exact same thing. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3732.7000000000003s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and Israel, perhaps chief among them. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3735.0400000000004s)]
*  And this is why there's been this odd, you know, some people have kind of remarked, wow, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3738.6000000000004s)]
*  why, it suddenly seems like Riyadh and Tel Aviv, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3742.44s)]
*  Riyadh and Jerusalem are such close buddy buddies these days. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3746.0200000000004s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3749.0200000000004s)]
*  It's because they are experiencing a version of the same form of post-2011 shock. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3749.88s)]
*  Both of those countries had become very comfortable with the state fashion [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3754.36s)]
*  of U.S. engagement in business, the region. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3759.06s)]
*  But the correlates of U.S. geopolitical conduct [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3761.84s)]
*  in the Middle East have fallen away as the realities of the region have evolved. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3766.6400000000003s)]
*  And to me, what this means going forward is that, you know, before we think about, you know, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3774.6000000000004s)]
*  engaging in popular culture and ways to try and have certain kinds of influences, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3782.2599999999998s)]
*  we need to have a clearer sense of, you know, what we're trying to achieve. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3786.66s)]
*  And, you know, I do agree as a someone who occasionally wears the hat [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3791.8999999999996s)]
*  of a conventional policymaker that security and stability is absolutely essential. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3799.2799999999997s)]
*  But I believe that the way you achieve that, the way you get that is [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3806.0s)]
*  to engage seriously in the long, difficult, one step forward, seven step back process [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3811.38s)]
*  of starting to take something like genuine political reform [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3821.52s)]
*  and participatory politics seriously. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3827.2200000000003s)]
*  And you can give a democracy and human rights justification for doing that. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3830.32s)]
*  That's fine. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3834.1200000000003s)]
*  It's a good reason. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3834.76s)]
*  But you can also give a damn good security and stability argument for doing so with the idea [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3835.38s)]
*  that these societies will only be secure and stable over the long term if you make progress [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3840.08s)]
*  in franchising their populations and citizens, right? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3846.7999999999997s)]
*  What we're seeing in Algeria literally as we speak, you know, is I think confirmation of something [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3850.96s)]
*  that many of us who monitor the region have been saying for years when things started [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3858.7599999999998s)]
*  to go bad after 2011, you know, and as some of our closest allies in the region, you know, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3862.86s)]
*  countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Emirates doubled down on certain kinds [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3869.44s)]
*  of policy, you know, positions, ones that this administration has been only too happy [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3874.04s)]
*  to enable and I think thinks itself to be in control of things that it's not in control of. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3880.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, the Trump administration. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3886.3999999999996s)]
*  I think the Trump administration is being played by the Emiratis and the Saudis just, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3888.7799999999997s)]
*  you know, to no end. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3895.66s)]
*  And so, you know, what's happening in Algeria is a confirmation of this idea that look, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3898.7799999999997s)]
*  given where we've ended up, it's only a finite amount of time before the forces [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3903.34s)]
*  that produced 2011 come back again because the same basic social contradictions [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3909.2599999999998s)]
*  that produced those events are still present, you know? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3913.98s)]
*  And if so, if we're going to go through this again ever so often [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3917.02s)]
*  and if there's diminishing returns on it, meaning that the state has to use ever greater amounts [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3920.9s)]
*  of regulation, enforcement and violence, we're just going to create a cycle [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3926.36s)]
*  of instability and insecurity. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3932.34s)]
*  And so, you know, this is why I think it's time for a broader strategic reevaluation. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3935.52s)]
*  So, you know, I'd say in a sense, this is a cop out because I don't have good answers for the, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3942.76s)]
*  you know, what should we be doing now in terms of the day-to-day influencing of popular opinion, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3949.0800000000004s)]
*  but I think we shouldn't be doing that until we get a better sense of where we think things need [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3953.5s)]
*  to be going in a more strategic fashion. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3958.9399999999996s)]
*  Thank you everyone. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3961.1s)]
*  Thanks for being here all day. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3988.7s)]
*  I want to thank Carnegie Endowment, Nathan, Sarah and other staff for hosting us here. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3991.64s)]
*  And have a good day. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=3997.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=4000.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5tyus6pE4g&t=4000.9s)]
