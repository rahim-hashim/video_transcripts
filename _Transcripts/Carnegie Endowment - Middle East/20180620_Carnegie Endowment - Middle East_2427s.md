# The Fight for Freedom in Modern Iran 1
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [June 20, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw)
*  We'll get started in just a minute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you all so much for coming this evening to the Carnegie Endowment. I'm Kareem Sajidpur. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=29.92s)]
*  And I have with my friends who are in this world of writing and advocacy, a deal in which if they write a book, they have an open invite to speak at Carnegie. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=34.92s)]
*  And Massey and her husband, Kambis, told me that they were going to be writing a book last year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=48.92s)]
*  I never imagined that the book would be done within a year and we will be hosting them tonight. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=56.92s)]
*  So we're very, very honored to host Massey. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=62.92s)]
*  I am reminded of a quote from Eleanor Roosevelt whenever I think about Massey, the former First Lady. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=67.92s)]
*  She said, a woman is like a teabag. You can't tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=73.92s)]
*  And Massey has both been in hot water quite often and she's very strong to show for it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=78.92s)]
*  The name of her book is The Wind in My Hair. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=86.92s)]
*  And I really do think it is one of the most important, unique, captivating books which have been has been written about post-revolutionary Iran in the last four decades. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=90.92s)]
*  It's for sale in the back and we're selling it lower than Amazon and Massey will sign it here afterwards. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=101.92s)]
*  So you should definitely buy it here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=106.92s)]
*  Massey, as some of you know, is from a village of 650 people in northern Iran called Qomikola. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=109.92s)]
*  If you actually Google Qomikola, the only thing that comes up is Massey. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=116.92s)]
*  I love that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=122.92s)]
*  I Googled it today and only photos of Massey showed up. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=123.92s)]
*  Qomikola is more popular than clerics in Iran right now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=126.92s)]
*  I Googled it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=129.92s)]
*  And she writes in the book that in her village growing up, things like ceiling fans and bananas were luxuries. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=130.92s)]
*  And so she's gone from Qomikola to Brooklyn to, in my mind, being really one of the most important and dynamic women's rights activists in Iran. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=139.92s)]
*  What's remarkable in the Internet age is that the diaspora communities can really become integral parts of the homelands of their mother countries. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=150.92s)]
*  And that's certainly the case with Massey. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=159.92s)]
*  Between her Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and Telegram, she has several million followers. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=161.92s)]
*  And when I check the numbers she gets, she actually gets more views than entire networks, whether that's BBC version or Manito. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=168.92s)]
*  So she really is a force of nature. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=176.92s)]
*  From an early age, Massey didn't like the hijab, even though she came from a quite traditional family. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=179.92s)]
*  And there's a wonderful quote in the book in which she says, if it's so great, why don't men wear it too? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=186.92s)]
*  And she writes that she's the first woman in her family to have been arrested, jailed, pregnant before marriage and divorced. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=192.92s)]
*  So she's had a lot of firsts, both in the context of her own family, but in the context of Iranian women. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=200.92s)]
*  And several years ago, I invited Massey to speak at a conference in London, which I helped to organize on behalf of the Aspen Institute for members of Congress, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=207.92s)]
*  about 20, 25 members of Congress, senators, House members. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=218.92s)]
*  And traditionally, the conversation about Iran in those contexts is about enriched uranium and Hezbollah and Bashar Assad. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=224.92s)]
*  And Massey came and gave an incredible 25 minute presentation about her story and hijab. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=234.92s)]
*  And we had a fascinating discussion afterwards. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=241.92s)]
*  And there was a very prominent member of Congress who asked Massey a question. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=244.92s)]
*  She was totally captivated by Massey's presentation. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=249.92s)]
*  And she inadvertently conflated the word jihad and hijab. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=252.92s)]
*  So she was asking Massey about the jihab. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  Mixed. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=261.91999999999996s)]
*  Why are women forced to wear the jihab? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=263.91999999999996s)]
*  And that evening, we had one of the speakers joining us a little bit late. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=267.91999999999996s)]
*  And so he was getting caught up by another member of Congress. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=275.92s)]
*  And that other member of Congress said, well, today we had a fascinating debate which centered around one question. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=278.92s)]
*  And that question was the debate in Iran, haji or no haji. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=285.92s)]
*  So he had said it makes up the word hijab and haji as well. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=290.92s)]
*  And so I think by now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=294.92s)]
*  And I said one pronunciation, the pronunciation of hijab is that difficult? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=298.92s)]
*  Imagine wearing that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=302.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=303.92s)]
*  But I think she single handedly educated much of the country, certainly members of Congress, about the issue of hijab. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=304.92s)]
*  Our lovely moderator tonight is Nina Ansari, who's written a wonderful book herself called Jewels of Allah. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=313.92s)]
*  And though Massey and Nina come from very different backgrounds, as I said, Massey comes from a village of 650 people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=319.92s)]
*  Nina comes from one of Iran's most prominent families. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=328.92s)]
*  Her father is really one of those most dynamic and accomplished Iranians I know. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=331.92s)]
*  He was Minister of Finance, ambassador to the United States before the revolution. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=339.92s)]
*  So though they come from these very different backgrounds, they in some ways kind of arrived at the same destination. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=343.92s)]
*  So you guys are going to be talking a little bit about that today. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=350.92s)]
*  So Nina and Massey will have as much time as you like for your own conversation. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=353.92s)]
*  And then we'll open it up to all of you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=357.92s)]
*  And as I said, we have books in the back cheaper than Amazon, which Massey will gladly sign for you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=360.92s)]
*  So thank you again for coming and look forward to the discussion. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=365.92s)]
*  So don't run away after that. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=367.92s)]
*  Buy the book. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=369.92s)]
*  Thank you, Karim, John, for the lovely introduction. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=373.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=376.92s)]
*  I'm thrilled to be here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=377.92s)]
*  I'm honored to be here to moderate this discussion. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=379.92s)]
*  I loved reading your book. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=382.92s)]
*  It's just such a fascinating story of politics, culture, gender roles, the complexities of Iranian society. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=384.92s)]
*  But most importantly, a very emotional story about the Iranian woman, her resilience, her hope, her strength, her courage. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=394.92s)]
*  So congratulations. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=405.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=406.92s)]
*  And congratulations. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=407.92s)]
*  BBC Radio just named Massey's book as its book of the week this week. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=408.92s)]
*  So the accolades, the accolades keep coming. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=413.92s)]
*  Coming. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=417.92s)]
*  She's a testament to the work that you do. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=418.92s)]
*  Massey, I wanted to open with some powerful words in your book from your mother, if that's OK. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=421.92s)]
*  So I'm going to quote Massey's lovely mom. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=429.92s)]
*  You write, My mother used to say that the darkness is a monster, a shapeless black demon that feeds on your fear. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=432.92s)]
*  If you are scared of it, then the shadow grows bigger and it will envelope you and swallow you whole. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=441.92s)]
*  Open your eyes wide, as wide as possible. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=447.92s)]
*  She'd urge me when I was a young girl. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=450.92s)]
*  Stare in the darkness and the shadow will disappear. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=452.92s)]
*  Never be afraid of the darkness, but stare it down. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=455.92s)]
*  Massey, you refer to your mother as a true feminist and that she was unique because she earned her own money and didn't rely on your father. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=459.92s)]
*  And then you speak about your father, who was very traditional and really believed, right, you know, really was beholden to antiquated notions of womanhood. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=468.92s)]
*  And that you mentioned how he expected girls to stay indoors and out of sight. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=477.92s)]
*  So not what you are, obviously. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=483.92s)]
*  And that every time you wanted to do something like go out and play with the boys, you heard it's not allowed. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=485.92s)]
*  Now, as a young girl, it was very obvious you had a mind of your own. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=491.92s)]
*  And not only that, you were determined to forge your own journey, your own path, which is on the one hand, very inspirational. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=495.92s)]
*  On the other hand, you showed that being born and raised in that environment, you were not you were determined not to be beholden to the life that was prescribed to you for you as a woman in the Islamic Republic. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=503.92s)]
*  Can you talk a little bit about the challenges of growing up in a household with such opposing viewpoints, meaning you had a mother who was an obvious feminist and unique, as you mentioned, and a very traditional father? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=516.92s)]
*  What were some of the challenges you faced growing up in a household with opposing views like that? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=526.92s)]
*  First of all, I said I trust you, but I changed my mind. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=532.92s)]
*  I don't trust you anymore because I told you don't ask the first question about my mother. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=535.92s)]
*  It's going to make me really emotional. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=540.92s)]
*  But I'm going to tell you when I came here, I saw two amazing women and I hugged them. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=542.92s)]
*  I haven't hugged my mom for nine years. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=550.92s)]
*  I'm really pleased that meeting so wonderful people here, including these two amazing women. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=553.92s)]
*  When I was a kid, I never thought that I'm going to write about my mother because my hero was people like Azhar Nafisi. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=561.92s)]
*  My dream was like, can I write one day like Azhar Nafisi wrote it to the rest of the world? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=569.92s)]
*  Can I do the same? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=577.92s)]
*  So here my dreams come true. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=579.92s)]
*  My mom became an author. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=583.92s)]
*  So here my dreams come true and my mom became a hero in my book. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=586.92s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you how. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=592.92s)]
*  My mom was not able to read and write. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=594.92s)]
*  We didn't have inside bathroom. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=598.92s)]
*  We were really poor. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=602.92s)]
*  So we had outhouse and it was in the backyard garden, which was really dark. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=603.92s)]
*  As I wrote in my book, it was pitch black, even blacker than black. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=609.92s)]
*  And my mom used to say that I'm not going to take you to the outhouse every night. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=614.92s)]
*  So just, you know, staring into the darkness. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=619.92s)]
*  When you stare into the darkness, then the darkness will disappear. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=623.92s)]
*  But if you let your fear win, then the darkness can devour you. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=627.92s)]
*  So I had so many darkness in my life. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=632.92s)]
*  You know, being expelled from high school, going into prison at the age of 19, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=635.92s)]
*  being expelled from Iranian parliament, growing up in a poor society. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=642.92s)]
*  And two of my brothers were involved in the war between Iran and Iraq. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=646.92s)]
*  Both of them got injured. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=650.92s)]
*  Being a woman means that you experience discrimination every day. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=653.92s)]
*  And if you are poor, that means everyone discriminates against you. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=657.92s)]
*  So I had to make a decision. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=662.92s)]
*  My mom said that just open your eyes as wide as you can. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=665.92s)]
*  And I did. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=669.92s)]
*  That is the way that I made a decision that to be a victim or to be a victorious. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=670.92s)]
*  So I became, you know, the hero of my own life rather than be a person who, you know, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=677.92s)]
*  timid, scared of everything. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=683.92s)]
*  And I remember that my little brother was an example of all the freedom that I wanted to have. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=685.92s)]
*  Because, you know, in the early age, as Carrie mentioned, that I didn't like hijab, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=690.92s)]
*  that doesn't mean I was an open-minded girl and I was aware of feminist movement. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=695.92s)]
*  I was fighting for equality. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=701.92s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=703.92s)]
*  All came in an innocent way from jealousy. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=705.92s)]
*  I didn't want my brother to enjoy everything that I was banned. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=709.92s)]
*  You know, I had to be a good girl in my own dialect, Khariki. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=713.92s)]
*  So I had to be someone who, you know, carry all the most visible symbol of Islamic Republic on my body as a kid from the age of seven, the hijab. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=719.92s)]
*  And my brother was the one just jumping in the river, enjoying, you know, the beautiful river in Qomikola, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=731.92s)]
*  riding a bicycle, you know, singing, playing with boys around anytime he wanted. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=738.92s)]
*  And I had to stay behind the curtain. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=745.92s)]
*  So and I was like, anytime I did something which I was banned and forbidden, I get like, you know, locked out. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=747.92s)]
*  My father put me in a room and then locked the door. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=754.92s)]
*  And my mom said that anytime when you get, you know, locked out, is that correct? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=757.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=763.92s)]
*  Anytime when you get locked out, just, you know, look around. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=764.92s)]
*  You will find a window. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=768.92s)]
*  Sneak into the same room through that window. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=770.92s)]
*  So I got expelled from high school. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=773.92s)]
*  I got expelled from Iranian parliament. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=775.92s)]
*  I got expelled from my newspaper. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=777.92s)]
*  I got expelled from my own country and I found my window, which is social media. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=778.92s)]
*  I am there every day and I learned it all from my mother. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=783.92s)]
*  I was the one we had a black and white TV in my house watching all the clerics, all the mullahs, each channel, new mullah, all of them talking about me, my body, all of them. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=788.92s)]
*  So all the troublemakers in Iran is just women. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=801.92s)]
*  My hair was so important and everything. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=804.92s)]
*  So now I am not the one listening to the clerics. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=807.92s)]
*  They are listening to me. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=812.92s)]
*  And when I when I'm saying they're listening to me, it means they know me by my name and they have different names for me. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=819.92s)]
*  They call me a whore. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=827.92s)]
*  They call me a prostitute. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=829.92s)]
*  They call me Emma is the agent of CIA. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=830.92s)]
*  The agent of MI6 Zionist agent of Donald Trump. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=834.92s)]
*  So I don't care as far as they are listening to me and millions of Iranian women. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=840.92s)]
*  I'm happy. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=847.92s)]
*  I am not the listener. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=848.92s)]
*  And that is all I learned from my mother. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=850.92s)]
*  So that is why I strongly believe that if you want to bring change within the society, first of all, you have to start your own revolution, which I started my own revolution from my kitchen. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=853.92s)]
*  Beautiful. Thank you. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=866.92s)]
*  Masi, you talk about in May 2006 when you visited cottage. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=869.92s)]
*  How do you translate cottage in like outside of Iran? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=874.92s)]
*  The first time you went as an Aitemad, a columnist to Beirut and you saw women in the street wearing no head scarves and not being harassed, beaten or anything like that. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=879.92s)]
*  And how the shock, the initial shock of that has stayed with you. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=890.92s)]
*  Can you please give us insight for those of us who, you know, were not privy to that mindset of what what when you went to cottage, the image that you saw, was it very different from what you held or was it different from what you had imagined or what you had been told? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=894.92s)]
*  No, it was totally different when you feel the wind in your head. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=914.92s)]
*  The experience, you know, and I remember, you know, from the end of the day, you know, I remember. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=919.92s)]
*  You know, from the age I wanted to be to be as free as Ali, my brother. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=923.92s)]
*  But it's not easy. It's not going to happen overnight for somebody who is forced to wear it from the age of seven. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=928.92s)]
*  I always say that when you wear it from early childhood, then it's going to be part of your body. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=935.92s)]
*  You know, it's not easy to take it off. And when you go to cottage, just, you know, take it off and enjoy it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=942.92s)]
*  No, there are so many barriers, not only the government, not only the law, it's emotional pressure that you don't want to lose your, you know, your community. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=946.92s)]
*  You don't want to lose your emotional bandwidth, your family. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=957.92s)]
*  And I want to say sorry about how it was difficult for me even courage to take off my headscarf and publish a picture of myself like everywhere when I was going. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=960.92s)]
*  I was on bed except on TV. So it's just I know it's hypocrisy, but I needed my parents. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=970.92s)]
*  And I remember I gave a talk in San Francisco and I was wearing my famous black hat, which my so-called hijab. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=976.92s)]
*  And I was taught that my speech was against the whole system because it was during the demonstration. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=986.92s)]
*  All people were really angry. They were really sad. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=994.92s)]
*  And they I said that for more than 30 years, we, the people of Iran, had the fear inside us. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=997.92s)]
*  And now this is the government of Iran. They fear their own people. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1004.92s)]
*  So now this is the time that the whole government should be gone. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1009.92s)]
*  And my speech went viral and it went to my village. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1014.92s)]
*  So my mom was just watching my talk on a mobile phone and shouting my father's name. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1017.92s)]
*  My father's name is Ali as well. He was going, Ali, my daughter, my darling sister, she my darling daughter, she still wears hijab. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1025.92s)]
*  And my father just came and listened to what I said. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1038.92s)]
*  And so he got angry, which I cannot say what he said. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1041.92s)]
*  So he said that to collage baby in Chimichurri, Tony, who did he go shopping in a job that I bought at the point system or something. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1045.92s)]
*  So my father got really angry that you're really happy that she keeps her hat. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1054.92s)]
*  She's just, you know, saying the whole system must be gone. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1061.92s)]
*  So for my mom, it was not important that what I'm saying. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1064.92s)]
*  So that shows that this small piece of cloth became the honor of the family and everything in such society. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1069.92s)]
*  And that is why it took me two years even outside Iran, which, you know, I could take off my headscarf, my black hat on my media appearance. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1078.92s)]
*  That is why I always say that. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1087.92s)]
*  You can translate it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1089.92s)]
*  Oh, my God. The hat which you put, say that slowly, the hat which you put on your own head. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1097.92s)]
*  Yes. It means that when you lie to yourself, it's more painful than when the government lied to you. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1103.92s)]
*  When you don't live your own truth. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1112.92s)]
*  Yes, be your true self. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1113.92s)]
*  You know, sometimes this is the government, the law. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1115.92s)]
*  Sometimes it's just you. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1118.92s)]
*  It's liberating to be yourself in many ways, which brings me the piece of cloth that you mentioned, which brings me to the next question. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1119.92s)]
*  First of all, you're quite possibly the Islamic Republic's worst nightmare. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1126.92s)]
*  And I mean this. I mean this in the best, most complimentary way. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1130.92s)]
*  And I correct you. It's all women in Iran. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1135.92s)]
*  They scared of me just because I gave the platform to them. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1138.92s)]
*  Right. But you know, that's what I was going to get to, that you're giving a voice to millions of women, millions of the hardest to reach women. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1141.92s)]
*  You know, the regime tries to silence all these women and you're on the outside giving them a voice, millions, and bringing all their trials and tribulations to the attention of the global community at large. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1150.92s)]
*  Massey, my question is out of all the gender discriminatory laws in Iran and the list of which we know is endless. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1161.92s)]
*  Why did you choose the compulsory hijab as your focal point of contention? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1169.92s)]
*  Good question. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1174.92s)]
*  First of all, I don't want to show off and saying that I had a plan. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1175.92s)]
*  No, it was just an accident. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1179.92s)]
*  You know, I was the one telling myself that compulsory hijab is not that important. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1181.92s)]
*  I can even wear a chador and go to Iranian parliament and expose the corruption. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1187.92s)]
*  I was the one always saying that Iran, especially the Middle East, has so many bigger problems. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1192.92s)]
*  So let's solve bigger problems. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1199.92s)]
*  You know, freedom of choice, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, political freedom. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1201.92s)]
*  When I left Iran, first, my main focus was about human rights and exposing the corruption in politics. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1208.92s)]
*  And I was the one actually exposing the story of 57 people who got killed during 2009 demonstration. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1216.92s)]
*  My main focus was that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1224.92s)]
*  So I had a personal story which always... [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1226.92s)]
*  Suppressed. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1231.92s)]
*  Yeah, suppressed and doing self-censorship that, you know, hijab is not that important. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1233.92s)]
*  Just leave it behind. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1237.92s)]
*  And then my Facebook page became cheerless, like full of sorrow, sad news. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1239.92s)]
*  Because I was covering the story of those people who were getting killed, tortured to death, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1245.92s)]
*  who got bitten up to death after the demonstration. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1250.92s)]
*  So I got depressed. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1254.92s)]
*  I went out. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1256.92s)]
*  I was running in a beautiful street in London, full of blossoms. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1258.92s)]
*  To me, when I see blossoms and trees, it's like, call me Cola. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1262.92s)]
*  So I was enjoying myself. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1265.92s)]
*  I published a photo and I... [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1267.92s)]
*  To just, you know, tell my story to other people who are like sad like me. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1269.92s)]
*  That, you know, we have to see the other side of life. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1274.92s)]
*  So I said that this is spring here. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1278.92s)]
*  And every time when I run in a free country and I feel the wind in my hair, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1280.92s)]
*  it just reminds me of the time when my hair was like a hostage in the hands of Iranian government. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1285.92s)]
*  That was the caption. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1291.92s)]
*  And I didn't have any plan to launch a campaign. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1292.92s)]
*  I got so many comments from Iranian women, envying my freedom from compulsory job. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1296.92s)]
*  When? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1302.92s)]
*  At the same time when there was a demonstration in Iran, when there were so many bigger problems in Iran. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1303.92s)]
*  So I learned from women that they want to talk about their personal freedom and it's important for them. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1308.92s)]
*  So actually, this is important for us. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1315.92s)]
*  So soon after, I found another picture of myself, which was taken inside Iran. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1320.92s)]
*  Me driving down toward my hometown, Jadah Haraz, without hijab. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1326.92s)]
*  And I published that with another caption. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1331.92s)]
*  I am a woman. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1334.92s)]
*  I didn't have freedom of choice in Iran, but I knew how to bypass the authority and create selfie freedom. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1335.92s)]
*  And I know if you are a woman and you don't believe in hijab, you have so many yabash. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1343.92s)]
*  It means stealthy, guilty pleasure. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1349.92s)]
*  So I asked whether you want to share your stealthy freedom with me, because freedom is freedom. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1352.92s)]
*  Freedom cannot come with any adjective. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1359.92s)]
*  And stealthy freedom, which Iranian government made us to do everything in itself, is not going to scare the government. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1362.92s)]
*  But when you talk about it, then it scares the government. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1370.92s)]
*  So I was bombarded by photos from Iranian women sending so many beautiful photos. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1374.92s)]
*  That time, I just learned that these women need their own platform. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1380.92s)]
*  They want to be their true selves. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1384.92s)]
*  They want to express themselves. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1387.92s)]
*  That is how my stealthy freedom was born. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1389.92s)]
*  And after three years, I found that all the media around the world, without any exaggeration, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1392.92s)]
*  all the media in the world, name it, even Kayhan and Saddam Hussein, they wrote about us. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1401.92s)]
*  For more than four decades, we have been censored. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1408.92s)]
*  But now around the world, all the media, they're talking about our true selves and Iranian women showing their resistance. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1413.92s)]
*  So after three years, I decided to do something like shift the online movement to something offline. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1421.92s)]
*  And I created White Wednesday's campaign because this is the way that these people now can meet each other in public and identify each other in public. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1428.92s)]
*  And why I picked hijab for my campaign, the reason was women inside Iran. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1437.92s)]
*  But for White Wednesday, I decided because I found that through this small piece of cloth, you can gather more people. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1445.92s)]
*  How? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1453.92s)]
*  How? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1454.92s)]
*  If you talk about custody of getting the right to, you know, the custody of child, it affects some of the women. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1455.92s)]
*  When you talk about, you know, the right to travel, to get a passport, some of the women can join you. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1460.92s)]
*  When you talk about entering the stadium, some of the women, you know, they're interested in this topic. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1465.92s)]
*  But when you talk about hijab, you're not talking about those who don't want to wear hijab. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1470.92s)]
*  You're talking about the whole society. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1476.92s)]
*  How? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1478.92s)]
*  It's an insult to my mother who wears hijab, but she doesn't want to force you to wear hijab. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1479.92s)]
*  It's an insult to men that you cannot control yourself and you get excited if you see my hair. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1485.92s)]
*  So it's an insult to whole society. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1492.92s)]
*  And when we talk about hijab, we're talking about our dignity, our identity. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1495.92s)]
*  And we talk about the whole society. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1500.92s)]
*  We talk about our bodies, which has been taken like a hostage for four decades. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1502.92s)]
*  That is why now, you know, when the girls of Revolution Street or women of White Wednesday, putting a head scarf and a stick, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1507.92s)]
*  they really don't want just, you know, a fight against a small piece of cloth. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1514.92s)]
*  This is just the beginning. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1519.92s)]
*  More symbolic. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1521.92s)]
*  Yes. And when we bring this wall down, then the rest will get easier. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1522.92s)]
*  Beautiful. Thank you. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1526.92s)]
*  You talk about a lot of obstacles that you overcame. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1527.92s)]
*  And I love how you say when one door we know would close, you would find another way to open the door. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1531.92s)]
*  I particularly love the comical instances that you talk about in your book that you take a very serious situation and you inject humor into it. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1537.92s)]
*  One of my absolute favorites and I want to ask you is when you went up to then President Khatami and you started singing a pop song to his face because women in Iran are not allowed to sing solo in public. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1549.92s)]
*  Can I ask what the pop song was? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1562.92s)]
*  You know, what his reaction was? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1567.92s)]
*  Sometimes you might think that, you know, it's a brave thing to do, but that's a problem. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1570.92s)]
*  It was not easy because you're sitting, you know, in front of a cleric who says that, you know, Ayatollah Khomeini said this and that using a lot of fast-forward. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1577.92s)]
*  And I didn't know what to do. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1587.92s)]
*  So things, you know, I mean, it was just simple. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1589.92s)]
*  You want to know whether you ever heard of a female singing. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1593.92s)]
*  I just, you know, asked, have you ever heard a woman singing? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1597.92s)]
*  And he said, yes, I heard a woman reading Koran. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1601.92s)]
*  I said, no, that is totally different. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1607.92s)]
*  Now, I'm actually asking whether you heard, you know, female singer. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1611.92s)]
*  And he said, no. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1615.92s)]
*  And I said, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1616.92s)]
*  If God, God, take me, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1618.92s)]
*  I will take your heaven with me. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1625.92s)]
*  Listen to me. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1633.92s)]
*  You know, something. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1637.92s)]
*  What was his reaction? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1638.92s)]
*  Was he stunned? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1639.92s)]
*  No, he wanted to. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1640.92s)]
*  He wanted to keep me silent. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1642.92s)]
*  And he did this. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1644.92s)]
*  Nervously. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1646.92s)]
*  And the other one I love is when you took photoshopped, you took a picture, photograph of a grumpy looking foreign minister. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1650.92s)]
*  That was not a joke. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1658.92s)]
*  I was really serious. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1659.92s)]
*  I was really mad. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1660.92s)]
*  I know. But I know you were mad. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1661.92s)]
*  But it was comical the way you, you know, the message, overall message, which is, you know, so you took a grumpy picture of Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and you photoshopped a blue woman. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1662.92s)]
*  You photoshopped a blue hijab on him and you put up them disseminating the message that men should join this movement. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1671.92s)]
*  Did he ever as far as you know, react to that or yes. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1678.92s)]
*  But I'm going to I'm going to tell you, I'm not doing that only to Javad Zarif. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1683.92s)]
*  If any man, any of you men here says that this is not important, I really make you to wear a job and sit for half an hour here. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1687.92s)]
*  And I think this is the only way you can make those men who say that this is not important to understand how it means to be humiliated, how it means to be forced to wear hijab. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1696.92s)]
*  I remember when I was sending letters to female politicians around the world that when we are fighting against a discriminatory law, you have to understand that legitimizing this law, giving power to the government of Iran to put more pressure on us. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1708.92s)]
*  So one of the female politicians challenged Javad Zarif in France and saying that why are you forcing us to wear hijab? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1725.92s)]
*  And he said that, you know, this is part of our culture. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1732.92s)]
*  So you have to respect our culture. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1735.92s)]
*  I was really mad. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1737.92s)]
*  I didn't know what to do. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1739.92s)]
*  Speechless. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1740.92s)]
*  So instead of writing an article, I photoshopped him and I said, if this is a culture, so respect the culture. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1741.92s)]
*  And then I didn't expect that men are going to do that because I wrote a caption that respect the culture. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1748.92s)]
*  And I asked him, you really want to understand how it means to be humiliated and forced to wear hijab? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1756.92s)]
*  Just wear it for one hour. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1762.92s)]
*  And I was bombarded by photos from men. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1764.92s)]
*  Beautiful movement. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1769.92s)]
*  Wearing hijab. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1771.92s)]
*  Sitting next to their wives, sisters, daughters, mothers being unveiled. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1772.92s)]
*  And saying that we don't own our women. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1777.92s)]
*  We don't want to force them. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1780.92s)]
*  And I actually received a comment from a woman saying that my father said that bring that headscarf. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1782.92s)]
*  She's just making a big, you know, call a spectacle. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1787.92s)]
*  Making a big spectacle. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1792.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1793.92s)]
*  And then bring that headscarf. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1794.92s)]
*  I'm going to wear it. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1795.92s)]
*  So the guy wrote to me that I gave my headscarf to my father and he just wore it. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1797.92s)]
*  And then he said that it's not that difficult. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1801.92s)]
*  I said, okay, so the whole day you're going to wear that and go and do the shopping. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1805.92s)]
*  And then after like 15 minutes, my father came to me and said, this is disaster. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1808.92s)]
*  So and he said, bring the camera and take the picture and send it to Masty. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1815.92s)]
*  She made my day by that comment. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1820.92s)]
*  And I published that. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1822.92s)]
*  And I asked them to send a video to me. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1824.92s)]
*  Just when you talk about this yourself, people can understand it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1826.92s)]
*  I received a video from a woman and standing next to her husband and the husband said that I never understood. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1830.92s)]
*  I never had this feeling. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1838.92s)]
*  But when I wore a hijab, I found out that how humiliating. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1839.92s)]
*  You forced my mother, my sister to wear hijab. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1843.92s)]
*  That video got 12 million views. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1846.92s)]
*  Just Google men in hijab. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1850.92s)]
*  Iran, now this. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1852.92s)]
*  12 million views. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1854.92s)]
*  Supreme Leader of Iran. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1856.92s)]
*  President of Iran. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1858.92s)]
*  The smiley foreign minister of Iran. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1859.92s)]
*  All together, they cannot get that much views. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1861.92s)]
*  That shows the power of Iranian people, men and women, when they get together. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1864.92s)]
*  I want to make sure we have time because we want to give the audience a chance to ask Masty questions. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1873.92s)]
*  So how much? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1878.92s)]
*  You stop me. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1879.92s)]
*  I talk a lot. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1880.92s)]
*  No, we can't get enough of you. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1881.92s)]
*  I just want to. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1883.92s)]
*  I can keep going. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1884.92s)]
*  OK, Masty, realistically speaking, this is going a little bit outside of the box. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1886.92s)]
*  So realistically speaking, do you think it's possible for women in Iran to gain freedom, to gain rights, even partial rights? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1892.92s)]
*  I'm being very realistic within the framework of Islam. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1901.92s)]
*  Look, this is the main pillar of Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1906.92s)]
*  Actually, there are three pillars. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1911.92s)]
*  Death to America, death to Israel, and hijab. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1913.92s)]
*  I strongly believe that each of us has our own responsibility. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1916.92s)]
*  I cannot overthrow the regime by myself. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1922.92s)]
*  But I can gather all these women together to ask for their own rights. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1926.92s)]
*  Because I strongly believe if a woman do not let anyone to force her about her own body, then that society never going to let the government to oppress her. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1934.92s)]
*  So this is really important for me. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1947.92s)]
*  And some people might say that, not some people. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1949.92s)]
*  The reformists always want to keep me silent and saying that the same argument. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1953.92s)]
*  So this is a red line for Islamic Republic. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1959.92s)]
*  Let's do the reform and then the right to choose. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1962.92s)]
*  It's going to come itself step by step. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1966.92s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1969.92s)]
*  Forty years, step by step never happened. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1970.92s)]
*  And those people who want to overthrow the regime for 40 years, they have been saying that when we overthrow the regime, then of course women are going to be free. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1973.92s)]
*  So for 40 years, we have to carry the most visible symbol of oppression on our body and then waiting for a regime to be gone. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1982.92s)]
*  We can help ourselves to be powerful. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1990.92s)]
*  And this is my job. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1994.92s)]
*  And now I get a lot of criticism that why you say that, you know, you say that within the Islamic Republic, his job is not going to be it's not going to be a hobby. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=1996.92s)]
*  It's going to be a choice. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2011.92s)]
*  A choice. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2012.92s)]
*  So you make this issue political, then you put women in danger and you make the government of Iran more restrict. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2013.92s)]
*  This is a big lie as well, because I strongly believe when those women inside Iran going in a platform, putting their head scarf on a stick, it's not just the headscarf. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2021.92s)]
*  It's the most visible symbol of oppression for 40 years. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2032.92s)]
*  And when the woman has the power to protest publicly, then if some if one day these men and women want to get together, it's easier because they already get united. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2038.92s)]
*  Well, you know, a testament to your work is the recent Iran protests, which which which women took, you know, the reins from that. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2050.92s)]
*  And the Dama Wahid became the dissimilar. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2058.92s)]
*  Well, she did what you know, your movement, which is White Wednesday, she went on top of a utility box with the white scarf. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2060.92s)]
*  She went there on Wednesday and she she went there from the beginning when I published her photo. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2067.92s)]
*  I got goosebumps because to me she was the Rosa Parks of Iran. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2072.92s)]
*  She came with her own idea of putting the headscarf on a stick, which was amazing. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2076.92s)]
*  And she encouraged many other women to do exactly the same. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2080.92s)]
*  And then some men were doing it as well. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2084.92s)]
*  And the government of Iran arrested 29 women of White Wednesdays who protested in public. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2086.92s)]
*  And I'm going to give you an example of Shema Babayi. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2092.92s)]
*  So Shema Babayi got arrested and she was interrogated for hours and hours. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2095.92s)]
*  She wrote on her Instagram page when she got released that I was interrogated for hours to to admit to confess that I'm working for Masih al-Inushe. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2099.92s)]
*  My interrogated said that your crime is that you're working for Masih. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2110.92s)]
*  And I said, no, this is Masih is working for me. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2114.92s)]
*  And I was like, you know, this is the generation. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2117.92s)]
*  This is the new generation to your to answer your question. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2120.92s)]
*  This generation is not going to ask for Islamic Republic, you know, to give their rights. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2124.92s)]
*  They are not waiting for compulsory hijab to be removed. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2131.92s)]
*  They remove it themselves. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2134.92s)]
*  This generation is not begging. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2136.92s)]
*  They're right. They're not waiting for the moderate president, for the conservative president, for the, you know, open minded one for nobody. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2138.92s)]
*  For me, the most amazing thing is through their civil disobedience, they do everything. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2145.92s)]
*  You know, women are in Iran. They are told you're not allowed to sing. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2151.92s)]
*  But we sing anyway. We have so many singers in Iran. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2155.92s)]
*  We told we are told that you cannot dance. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2158.92s)]
*  We dance anyway. We are told that you cannot show your hair. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2160.92s)]
*  We do it anyway. Anything that we are told not to do. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2163.92s)]
*  We are doing it. And this is the way that we we find we find our own agency. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2167.92s)]
*  And I strongly believe that if every individual person find that they are powerful and they are their own leader, then we can easily get rid of this, you know, oppressor. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2172.92s)]
*  Well, on this very positive note, can we open up the room to question and answer? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2185.92s)]
*  Hanum Afghami. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2192.92s)]
*  Actually, this is the first time I've met Masih and I worked for the women's movement in Iran for some 30 years. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2201.92s)]
*  And I have to say Masih, I don't know if I can say it without actually having tears, that it is so heartening to hear you. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2210.92s)]
*  And to see that what we dreamed of is there. It's alive. It's feisty. It's full of energy. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2220.92s)]
*  And also, I totally believe in what you're saying. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2228.92s)]
*  I think one of the major causes of the Iranian Revolution was what we had achieved for women prior to the revolution. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2232.92s)]
*  I think it hasn't been paid enough attention to because women cannot be the cause of anything major. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2240.92s)]
*  It has to be some other thing. But it's obvious if the Islamic Republic of Iran has spent all this money, all this trouble, all this time to just simply keep a scarf on women's heads. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2247.92s)]
*  It's a symbol of all that you were saying. Sorry that I'm taking the young lady's time, but we are of the same passion. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2262.92s)]
*  And for me, she is a realization of that passion. It shows that we're going to do it. I salute you. I love you. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2270.92s)]
*  And I wish you all the best. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2280.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2285.92s)]
*  Thank you so much. My father was against you. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2293.92s)]
*  I needed that hug. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2299.92s)]
*  We never had the chance to learn about you. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2304.92s)]
*  When I left Iran, I had the revolution against myself as well. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2309.92s)]
*  I had to do self-education to understand about what we had before the revolution. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2315.92s)]
*  And we were fighting for something that we already had. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2320.92s)]
*  And I don't understand when some people say that this is not important. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2325.92s)]
*  I don't know how can I convince the whole world that change only comes through women, believe in women, trust women? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2328.92s)]
*  Because after the revolution, only two years after the revolution, the Islamic Republic of Iran actually started to, you know, to oppress women because they know that this is a tool to control the whole society. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2339.92s)]
*  So that is why for me, when I pick up a hijab, I always say that because I strongly believe change comes. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2354.92s)]
*  The next revolution is going to be a revolution in Iran. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2362.92s)]
*  Just wait for the mic, please. Thank you. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2375.92s)]
*  I just want to know if Jewish or Baha'i or Zawasrin women are required to wear hijabs in Iran too. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2378.92s)]
*  You see, we're so powerful. Yes. We force everyone. And we claim that this is not important. We have so many bigger problems. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2386.92s)]
*  You know, actually, I went to European Parliament and then there were... this is really important story. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2393.92s)]
*  They invited me to talk about Burkini ban in France. So you see, it's not an internal matter and it's not a small issue. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2400.92s)]
*  It's really important the whole world should get together and condemn Burkini ban and travel ban. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2408.92s)]
*  But when it comes to compulsory hijab, it's a cultural issue. It's, you know, it's an internal matter. It's required by law. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2414.92s)]
*  I went to European Parliament. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkD8prSbClw&t=2424.92s)]
