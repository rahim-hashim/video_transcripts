Video Description: Popular explanations for the roots of the Middle East's conflicts often cite Western-imposed national boundaries during and after the First World War. Proponents of these explanations point to the famed Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916 and other deals that reflected imperial interests and seemingly sidelined Middle Eastern actors. A new book tackles this misguided narrative head-on, arguing that Middle Easterners actually had greater agency in their own state formation, especially during a decade of anti-colonial insurgencies and rebellions after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1922.

Join Frederic Wehrey as he moderates a discussion between Jonathan Wyrtzen, the author of Worldmaking in the Long Great War: How Local and Colonial Struggles Shaped the Modern Middle East, and panelists Asli Bali and Lisa Anderson.

# Re-Examining the Origin Myths of the Modern Middle East
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [November 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI)
*  Good morning. I'm Fred Wary, a senior fellow in the Middle East program at the Carnegie [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=30.0s)]
*  Endowment for International Peace. It's my pleasure to welcome you to this panel discussion [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=37.44s)]
*  on re-examining the origin myths of the modern Middle East. The turbulent era of civil wars [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=42.04s)]
*  and proxy interventions that rocked the Middle East after the era of uprisings of 2011, including [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=48.44s)]
*  the war against the self-proclaimed Islamic State, has subsided and longtime geopolitical [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=54.42s)]
*  rivals have shifted to diplomacy for now, though tensions still persist. In tandem, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=59.72s)]
*  the region's major outside hegemon, the United States, has scaled down its ambitions and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=65.56s)]
*  ended its so-called forever wars. And as a result, the region is marked by greater multipolarity [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=71.26s)]
*  among contending great powers. The US is still involved, of course, but so too are Russia, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=78.38s)]
*  and yet local Middle Eastern states are acting with increasing assertiveness and sovereignty [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=84.72s)]
*  in their foreign policies, forting the best laid plans of these great powers to impose [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=92.12s)]
*  their will over this region. Exhibit A, of course, is Saudi Arabia's recent snub to the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=97.3s)]
*  United States in the form of an OPEC production cut in conjunction with Russia. And this observation [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=102.86s)]
*  really lies at the heart of today's panel, which takes a look back into a seminal period [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  of the region's modern history to interrogate a persistent and popular explanation for the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  Middle East's current afflictions. The argument goes something like this. The boundaries of [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  the current state system in this region were unilaterally imposed by European colonial [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=128.82s)]
*  powers through a series of deals and agreements during and after the First World War to divide [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  up the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. And these boundaries were, quote, artificial, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=140.38s)]
*  meaning they did not correspond to demographic and ethnic realities on the ground and therefore [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=145.88s)]
*  laid the seeds for conflicts that persist to this day. Now, this, quote, artificial [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=151.02s)]
*  state thesis, epitomized by repeated references to the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, has [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=156.78s)]
*  been taken up by a range of voices, including Western journalists and U.S. policymakers in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=163.7s)]
*  Washington, D.C., where the idea of redrawing the region's boundaries to solve conflicts [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=168.54s)]
*  has become something of a parlor game. The narrative was even adopted by the Islamic [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=175.18s)]
*  state when it ceremoniously bulldozed the border between Iraq and Syria in 2016, proclaiming [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=180.62s)]
*  the end of the Sykes-Picot era on its 100-year anniversary. And yet, this explanation is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=188.62s)]
*  problematic for a number of reasons, most crucially because it leaves out an important [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=195.62s)]
*  player in the process of post-Ottoman state formation, namely Middle Easterners themselves. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=200.62s)]
*  And here, I'm very pleased to welcome the author of a fantastic new book of revisionist [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=207.62s)]
*  history that really brings local agency back into the story by arguing that the political [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  orders in this region were not just created through the stroke of a pen in European capitals, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  but rather through a long process of conflict and negotiation with and among Middle Eastern [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  actors that stretched from the end of the First World War into the 1930s. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=234.01999999999998s)]
*  Jonathan Wurtson is a professor of sociology and history at Yale University, and his new [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=239.22s)]
*  book, published this summer by Columbia University Press, is called World Making and the Long [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=246.22s)]
*  Great War, How Local and Colonial Struggles Have Shaped the Modern Middle East. It's a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=251.02s)]
*  compact book, but it covers a vast geographic scope, stretching from Morocco through North [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=257.02s)]
*  Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Levant, Turkey, and Iran. And while it certainly tackles this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=262.22s)]
*  period of history on its own terms, it does have echoes in the Middle East of today. And [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=268.34s)]
*  to discuss this resonance in the present, as well as the book's arguments, I'm pleased [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=274.84s)]
*  to also welcome two distinguished scholars who need no introduction. Asli Bali is a professor [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=279.34s)]
*  of law at Yale Law School, and Lisa Anderson is dean emerita at the School of International [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=284.9s)]
*  and Public Affairs at Columbia University. Jonathan, welcome. Starting out with you, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=290.9s)]
*  again, if you could expand from my rather crude summary on the book's arguments and [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=297.9s)]
*  really answer a question I think that every author gets asked, you know, why did you write [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=303.29999999999995s)]
*  this book? Why now? And why should we read it? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=308.0s)]
*  Thanks so much, Fred. Thanks. This is such a great forum to talk about these questions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=312.29999999999995s)]
*  And I'm going to try to be short because the respondents, I'm just thrilled to have Asli [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  and Lisa be able to interact about these questions in addition to you. Why write this book? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=324.9s)]
*  I started studying the Middle East about 30 years ago as an undergrad. I spent time in [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=330.9s)]
*  Israel-Palestine on a study abroad. I started to take classes about the region. And so this [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=337.06s)]
*  origin myth story, the Genesis narrative, this periodization marker in World War I and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=342.9s)]
*  the story of the making in the modern Middle East was something that I was trained in and I repeatedly [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=352.06s)]
*  read both in textbooks and either explicitly documented or even in just in the ways that [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=357.06s)]
*  studies of the mandate period that succeeds the Ottoman period were written, you know, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=363.86s)]
*  was inculcated in this dominant narrative that you just described about the war taking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=370.66s)]
*  the political order of the region apart because of the destruction of the Ottoman Empire. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=376.66s)]
*  And again, it's focused on the Ottoman Empire, most of the story. And then the explanation for [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=381.5s)]
*  where we get the present day nation state interstate system was in this imposition from [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=387.41999999999996s)]
*  the British and the French secondarily redrawing the map. Why write it? So that's a story that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=394.14s)]
*  I've dealt with and taught for over several decades now. And I moved, that's not what I was [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=400.97999999999996s)]
*  working on initially in my career. I initially started looking at French intervention in North [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=408.1s)]
*  Africa and specifically in Morocco. And a part of my first project got me into thinking about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  the Reef Republic, which is a, you know, was a functionally an autonomous polity through much [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=417.94s)]
*  of the early 1920s that is formed in the, from between 1919 and it gets crushed in 1925 to 27 [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=423.58000000000004s)]
*  by the Spanish and the French. But the puzzle of that kind of anomaly of this very successful [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=432.94s)]
*  militarily, it's phenomenally successful against the Spanish for a long time. And then it [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=439.74s)]
*  develops an administration, has a flag, has a constitution, has an anthem, tries to get it [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=443.82s)]
*  acknowledged by the League of Nations, but fails. I realized that the reef is one among many cases [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  that stretched across the region. And from that, and this is processing this in the 2010s, I am [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=456.5s)]
*  also in a, you know, hearing about the, with the centennial of World War I. So a lot of attention, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=464.65999999999997s)]
*  again, on that period in Europe, for sure. But also there's a surge of scholarship about World [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=472.46s)]
*  War I in the Middle East. And fantastic, both monographs that are delving into social history, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=480.66s)]
*  into environmental history, into both also into kind of synthetic treatments of the fate of the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=486.94s)]
*  Ottoman Empire and the Middle Eastern theater and the various fronts that are in play there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=494.34s)]
*  Thinking about that scholarship, and then at some point, these two, I started to put together the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=501.14s)]
*  two points that what's happening in the 1920s is not, there's not a massive break. And then that [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=507.34000000000003s)]
*  started, but this was a part of a longer period that opens up in World War I. And that drew me [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=511.98s)]
*  back into thinking about that origin narrative. And this, what I in the book, sort of just bring [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=518.82s)]
*  under the banner of a shorthand of the Sykes-Picot standard narrative. And in doing that, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=527.14s)]
*  again, having worked on North Africa for a good amount of time, I became very dissatisfied and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=532.86s)]
*  gradually just, the myth fell apart because of the realities. If you look at the empirics, the [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=538.38s)]
*  actual history that happens there doesn't fit the narrative. So that led me into rethinking. And [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=544.6999999999999s)]
*  again, as you mentioned, trying to think about what would be a synthetic story that does [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=551.78s)]
*  encompass Morocco to Iran that isn't just focused on this Lawrence of Arabia story or some piece of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=557.1s)]
*  a narrative in the Middle East, but actually kind of thoroughly and systematically thinks about what [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=565.14s)]
*  happens with the war across the region. And in doing that, we can talk about this more in the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=570.62s)]
*  interactions. But effectively, what the book does is say what we need to change are two dimensions. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=578.94s)]
*  Expand the breadth of our scope geographically, which I've been talking about, but in doing that, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=584.54s)]
*  and these kinds of things are interrelated, it demands, if you think about the region at that [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=590.06s)]
*  broader scale, then it demands also stretching out the time period that's important here. So on the [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=594.54s)]
*  front end, if you're thinking about North Africa, the Middle Eastern, greater Middle Eastern area is [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=599.0999999999999s)]
*  in a wartime period from 1911 at least, which is when Italy invades Ottoman North Africa, Tripoli [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=605.42s)]
*  and Benghazi. And from that period forward, there's different phases of this, but there's wartime that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=614.0600000000001s)]
*  extends for two decades. And this is shifting, again, just the balance of how we think about [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=619.66s)]
*  political order in the region away from loading up the Paris Peace Conference or these secret agreements [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=625.4200000000001s)]
*  between colonial powers, and then that creating reality in the region to centering war, which if [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=631.26s)]
*  you look at the rest of the political science literature or historical sociological literature, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=639.18s)]
*  war and state formation, territorialization, et cetera, that's the norm, is to put those things [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=644.14s)]
*  together. And there's been a weird exception that's applied to the Middle East and some other parts of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=649.1s)]
*  the global South that were colonized, including the kind of narrative, we can talk about this maybe, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=653.26s)]
*  but the narratives about the scramble for Africa that neglects the violence that's an integral part [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=657.34s)]
*  of those processes. Why read this book now? I think one of the things, as you mentioned, is [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=662.7s)]
*  that we're now in the early 21st century in a world historical period that is not dissimilar from [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=669.1800000000001s)]
*  the fluidity and the dynamism that's expressed in the early 20th century, globally, but specifically [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=678.22s)]
*  if we're talking about the Middle East. And in that, beyond the kind of bipolar international [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=683.82s)]
*  relations context that dominated much of the second half of the 20th century, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=690.7s)]
*  in this multipolar and very complex world, I think this argument that's really challenging are, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=696.0600000000001s)]
*  they might be implicit and they might be very explicit presuppositions about how great power [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=703.58s)]
*  intervention works in the world, which the strong version is that narrative I talked about with [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=709.42s)]
*  respect to the artificiality and unilateral imposition by the British and the French of [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=714.3s)]
*  these boundaries in the region. But to really look at that period critically and I think just [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=722.8599999999999s)]
*  with a more open and clear eye allows us to think about the present and think in much clearer and [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=732.54s)]
*  much better ways. And the lessons of that are that great powers do not work in the world [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=738.7s)]
*  unilaterally. It's a very interactive process when that happens. And in that, we have to take into [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=745.6600000000001s)]
*  account the integral role of local actors, local players, local movements, local power centers [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=752.5400000000001s)]
*  that are present. And that's not, I think one of the things that the book is trying to do is, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=759.6600000000001s)]
*  for World War I, and I think this would be something we need to take into account today, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=765.1s)]
*  is that those stories of the local actors, the stories of the Reef Republic, the stories of the [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=769.26s)]
*  Senussis in Libya, the stories of different Kurdish polities that are mobilized and perhaps [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=773.26s)]
*  at that moment get interrupted or they get crushed. Those are not footnotes because they're [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=781.5s)]
*  still part of these longer processes and longer topography of the region, even if [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=788.94s)]
*  for different moments those get suppressed and marginalized, sometimes attempted to be erased, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=795.1s)]
*  those are still present. And this is something we've seen in the past decade is from the Reef [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=800.7800000000001s)]
*  with 2017 protests emerging out of Al-Husayma, from eastern Libya, from ongoing conflict in [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=805.0200000000001s)]
*  Kurdistan as that's framed by those actors, and including the conflict in southern Arabia, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=814.3000000000001s)]
*  that those historical, there's both a memory there, there's also just a kind of sociological [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=822.94s)]
*  continuity that those fracture points remain active in the present, that were the fracture [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=830.38s)]
*  points in this earlier period. And the second thing is that the actual outcomes of the region are [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=835.26s)]
*  the major players of the region today are outside of this narrative, outside of a [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=840.9399999999999s)]
*  European imposed reality. So those, I'm just going to list them, the Republic of Turkey, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=846.6999999999999s)]
*  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, but that moment, the Pahlavi Iran, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=851.5799999999999s)]
*  are the regional hegemons among them, and those do not fit into that Sykes-Picot narrative. They're [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=857.9s)]
*  all local projects that imposed to some degree their own reality on this. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=864.62s)]
*  And so I think that kind of gives you some ideas about the reasons why to read this now, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=869.42s)]
*  and the reasons for thinking about a more complex system that's in place in the Middle East, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=874.38s)]
*  that is interactive internally, but also interfaces through the Mediterranean, to the Black Sea, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=881.18s)]
*  through the Indian Ocean, and to other regions, and that that world that I'm trying to recreate [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=886.62s)]
*  or reassess at that moment, I think is the rubric that we could use in the present. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=891.5799999999999s)]
*  That's terrific, Jonathan. A lot of food for thought there, and definitely appreciate you [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=896.54s)]
*  bringing in the war-making aspect of this. And I will say, reading your book, the individual case [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=900.2199999999999s)]
*  studies could be read as sort of examples of counterinsurgency and insurgency on their own [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=906.6999999999999s)]
*  merit. So a lot of fascinating material there that we'll circle back to. Asli, I'll turn to you. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=913.02s)]
*  You published an article in a law journal in 2016, which was kind of the height of the Sykes-Picot [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=919.58s)]
*  mania, if you will, and you echoed a lot of Jonathan's points, and I was particularly struck [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=925.4200000000001s)]
*  by your argument that this whole artificial state thesis was actually used at the time by [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=930.3000000000001s)]
*  the powers to justify the rule, and that the law was actually used to justify the rule. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=938.14s)]
*  Your second point was the idea that cosmopolitanism within political boundaries [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=944.14s)]
*  was not necessarily a foreign import, but it had a long history. It was organic. So I wondered if you [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=949.58s)]
*  could expand on those points and also react to some of Jonathan's arguments in his book. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=956.3s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much, Fred. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point, too. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=965.18s)]
*  Thanks so much, Fred, and thank you so much for inviting me to join this conversation. It's a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=972.94s)]
*  real pleasure to have this opportunity to engage with Jonathan's really great book. On your question, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=977.0200000000001s)]
*  I would actually pick up on a theme that runs through Jonathan's book, which is that history [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=984.0600000000001s)]
*  doesn't repeat, but it rhymes and echoes, which is a beautiful point that he makes in the book. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=988.62s)]
*  I think that's right. The motivation I had for writing the article that you just referenced [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=994.7s)]
*  was the echoes of the so-called artificial state thesis and the arguments from a century earlier [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=999.74s)]
*  on the centenary of the First World War, which produced a new set of conversations, and as you [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1005.82s)]
*  said, parlor games, you mentioned in your own introduction, around reimagining the map of the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1010.78s)]
*  Middle East. But the argument was, and again, this is the point you're making on artificial states and [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1015.66s)]
*  supposed challenges of cosmopolitanism in the Middle East, the new set of conversations in 2016 [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1021.98s)]
*  or so had to do with whether the internal diversity of the region was the source of its [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1029.18s)]
*  governance crises. And the argument was part of a recurring debate that redrawing the borders of the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1033.42s)]
*  region would serve as a good conflict resolution strategy on the basis that the original maps were [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1039.5800000000002s)]
*  somehow configured by imperial powers, exactly along the lines that Jonathan described just now [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1046.38s)]
*  and also in his book, and that they did a terrible job. And so the new map makers a century later in [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1052.0600000000002s)]
*  2016 would be in a better position to come up with maps that enable demography to correspond [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1058.14s)]
*  to cartography. And so, and imagine tripartite division of Iraq following the Iraq war, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1065.18s)]
*  U.S. intervention, but also divisions of a variety of kinds in Syria, Yemen, Libya, and other countries, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1071.3400000000001s)]
*  which would supposedly then create these demographically homogenous units. And [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1077.8200000000002s)]
*  so I wrote this article to reject these ideas, both to comment on the so-called [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1082.6200000000001s)]
*  conflict resolution strategy of ethnic cleansing, which is really what underlies the idea that [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1087.1s)]
*  you need to create homogenous demographic units, but also to offer a rebuttal to the claim that [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1091.98s)]
*  either one, the borders of the region are artificial, or two, that it's impossible for [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1097.26s)]
*  the region to imagine territorial arrangements that foster and support pluralism, that there is a kind [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1103.8999999999999s)]
*  of anti-cosmopolitanism necessary to the politics of the Middle East. And so I tried to provide [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1111.82s)]
*  something of a synopsis of a broader history that rejects the kind of static view of the region [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1118.9399999999998s)]
*  or the imagined trans-historical importance of religious divisions on the basis of which those [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1124.78s)]
*  arguments proceeded, rejecting an idea that the region is sort of trapped in ethno-sectarian [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1129.58s)]
*  divisions that can only be resolved through new borders, and really returning to Indigenous [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1136.06s)]
*  political configurations of the earlier centuries, which obviously were entirely about multi-sectarian, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1141.82s)]
*  multi-ethnic, multi-linguistic political organization of the region, and then asking what it is about [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1149.34s)]
*  that history that came to be lost in the ways in which, as Jonathan puts it, the new political [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1156.06s)]
*  imaginaries that emerged in the long Great War produced particular kinds of borders. Now, having [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1161.1s)]
*  said that about my own earlier work, so that tries to suggest that there are ways of thinking about [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1167.1s)]
*  the territorial configuration of the Middle East that embrace rather than reject cosmopolitanism, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1172.54s)]
*  and myself, in my argument, rejecting partition as a conflict resolution strategy and tying it [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1177.34s)]
*  rather to ethnic cleansing and genocide, the very problems that we're trying to avoid in the region, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1184.94s)]
*  I do want to turn to how Jonathan's book really informs this argument. To begin with, he really [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1190.7s)]
*  situates, as his own comments made clear, his history as neither top-down nor bottom-up, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1196.94s)]
*  but looking at the intersection of international and local struggles in the production of [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1202.3s)]
*  the territorial configurations that did emerge in the region and the kinds of political identities [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1207.5800000000002s)]
*  and new polities that were formed in a moment of transformation in the sort of long durée of the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1212.7s)]
*  First World War. He offers a repuridization, a geographic expansion of our understanding of [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1219.82s)]
*  the region and a new explanation through this for how and why new polities emerged, new boundaries [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1225.1799999999998s)]
*  were drawn. What that history enables by Ottomanizing the Great War and de-Europeanizing, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1229.82s)]
*  and again, I'm barring his language here, provincializing the European encounter, is [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1236.22s)]
*  really demonstrating that it is the case that the boundaries, the current boundaries, certainly [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1240.54s)]
*  they're no more artificial than boundaries anywhere else in the world, nor is there such [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1246.06s)]
*  a thing as natural boundaries. Boundaries are necessarily politically produced, but they were [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1250.06s)]
*  the product of violent conflict and conflict that involved both international and local actors [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1254.06s)]
*  negotiating around a set of identities that at that moment emerged as salient around new [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1259.5s)]
*  territorial configurations. What's critical here is, apart from rejecting the imperial account [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1266.7s)]
*  that says these borders are simply the product of an external imposition, the bottom-up account [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1273.4199999999998s)]
*  is also not necessarily celebratory. In other words, telling a story about local self-determination [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1280.3799999999999s)]
*  isn't necessarily telling a story that's any less violent or less bloody. The point that Jonathan [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1285.5s)]
*  makes very well is that local self-determination, as with, for example, the struggle for independence [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1290.9399999999998s)]
*  in the Turkish context, was a bloody and violent process that involved ethnic cleansing, genocide, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1296.4599999999998s)]
*  resettlement, assimilation. These were the forces that produced modern Turkey, and that the moments [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1301.74s)]
*  of reconfiguration are ones that can both be fluid and also introduce new forms of rigidity [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1307.26s)]
*  that take periods of mobility and then fix particular kinds of boundaries. All of these [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1314.38s)]
*  are in fact violent processes. And so returning to your question, Fred, there is an intrinsic underlying [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1319.74s)]
*  sort of heterogeneity to the region that we're operating in. And the idea that changing borders [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1326.46s)]
*  would be a strategy for conflict resolution, I think, can easily be rebutted by looking at the [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1333.02s)]
*  very history that Jonathan tells, a history that shows us that generating these borders is an [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1337.8200000000002s)]
*  extraordinarily violent conflictual process, and that if what we're trying to do is imagine ways to [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1343.18s)]
*  end the kind of instability and conflict that we see in the region today, a far better focus of [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1349.5s)]
*  our attention would be to look at patterns of governance that are generating instability, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1354.6999999999998s)]
*  rather than imagining new maps as resolving old conflicts. So let me stop there with my comments, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1359.34s)]
*  staying within time, and I know that, okay, great, we'll be turning next to Lisa, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1368.62s)]
*  and I look forward to her comments as well. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1374.06s)]
*  Great, that was terrific. I'm unfortunately going to turn off the camera because I have some [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1375.5s)]
*  connection problems, but I'm not disappearing at all from the conversation. So Lisa, again, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1385.02s)]
*  turning to you to wrap us up. You've certainly written a number of influential works on the [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1391.74s)]
*  colonial period, and then post-colonial state formation, obviously a book on Tunisia, and [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1397.34s)]
*  most of the thinking of your foreign affairs piece in 2011, where you drew parallels to [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1403.98s)]
*  post-war protests and rebellions in Egypt and Egypt, maybe in their parallels to the [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1409.5s)]
*  to the Arab Spring. Obviously, more than a decade later, we're in a very different place. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1416.78s)]
*  You've talked about sort of political order that has emerged, very democratic and liberal, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1421.9s)]
*  or I'm wondering if you could extract lessons from Jonathan's book, from what we've heard, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1428.5400000000002s)]
*  that you would give to policy-seekers, what would they be? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1436.94s)]
*  Well, once again, thank you, Fred, for inviting me and Jonathan for provoking a really interesting [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1446.7s)]
*  conversation here. I think it's an excellent book, and I commend it to everyone. I want to start, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1453.66s)]
*  actually, Fred, with the first paragraph of that foreign affairs article, if I might, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1459.74s)]
*  just to remind people of how things rhyme, if you will, as Jonathan puts it. And this is what I [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1466.46s)]
*  wrote, in Tunisia protesters escalate, by the way, this article was published in 2011, in Tunisia, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1474.22s)]
*  protesters escalated calls for the restoration of the country's suspended constitution. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1480.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, Egyptians rose in revolt as strikes across the country brought daily life to a halt [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1485.66s)]
*  and toppled the government. In Libya, provincial leaders worked feverishly to strengthen their [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1490.94s)]
*  newly independent republic. It was 1919. So the point I was making then was, yes, things were [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1495.5s)]
*  rhyming. Things were upheaval at the time in Egypt and in Tunisia and in Libya, and [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1503.1s)]
*  this wasn't the first time we had seen that. And I think it is important simply to [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1511.1799999999998s)]
*  mark that and to remind everyone who's thinking about the Middle East and North Africa at any [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1517.4199999999998s)]
*  given moment that there is a history to this. And this is a history that is, whether it's literally [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1525.74s)]
*  remembered by people, this is now 100 years later, probably, it is certainly built into the [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1532.54s)]
*  collective memories that people have. And on that score, I want, I think, probably to [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1540.62s)]
*  suggest that there's another piece of the story that Jonathan tells that I think might be [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1546.94s)]
*  worthwhile thinking about today. He does an extraordinary job at showing the complexity [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1554.22s)]
*  of politics at the local level as movements and leaders and so forth, again, from the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1563.98s)]
*  Reef Rebellion in Morocco to both the Tripoli Republic and the San Jose movement in Libya and [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1571.26s)]
*  the battles in the Arabian Peninsula and so forth all the way up to Turkey. He takes these and shows [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1580.3799999999999s)]
*  us that clearly the drivers there were not Europeans sitting in London and Paris and trying to draw [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1587.26s)]
*  borders, but it was a much more complex story virtually across the region. And you don't see [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1595.26s)]
*  that complexity unless you start before the formal beginning of the First World War and [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1603.02s)]
*  and well into the 1930s. But he also, in doing that, I think, invites us to think a little bit more [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1607.9s)]
*  about the region as a region as it was understood then, because he refers several times to Jaffar [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1618.14s)]
*  Al-Oscari, who was ultimately an important Iraqi figure in the interwar period, but of course, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1626.7s)]
*  started his life as an Ottoman military leader. And there were quite a lot of people like that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1632.94s)]
*  at that time. So I, because of what was happening in 2011, noted that there were, you know, upheavals [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1640.14s)]
*  in Egypt and Tunisia. The Tunisian Death Star Party was established in 1920. All of this was efforts to [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1650.14s)]
*  not change borders. The, you know, Tunisians by then were not disputing the fact that the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1658.54s)]
*  French had designed those borders and the Egyptians were not disputing the borders that the [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1666.46s)]
*  British had established between Libya and Egypt. But they were disputing questions of independence [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1672.1399999999999s)]
*  and constitutionalism. It was a very sophisticated cosmopolitan, if you will, conversation. And I [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1680.3s)]
*  think that's part of also the story that there was a region-wide questioning of political [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1687.18s)]
*  organization, of political sovereignty, of autonomy, of identity, that is not simply the [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1695.5s)]
*  violence part of the story, which I think is very important. And I don't dispute that. But I think [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1704.46s)]
*  if we were to look at places where there were relatively peaceful demands being made, and of [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1709.9s)]
*  course rejected at peace conferences and so forth, we would see something that's even more [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1716.86s)]
*  lively in the efforts at the local level to sort of seize control of the [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1723.82s)]
*  political narrative and seize the agency, as we say. And in that sense, I think there's a [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1735.58s)]
*  a layer here that I'd like us to highlight a little bit more than we do, both in this [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1744.6200000000001s)]
*  historical period and today, which is what I guess I am, you know, left to call regional. But one of [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1749.3400000000001s)]
*  the things that if you look across the uprisings and conflicts that the book describes so well, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1759.42s)]
*  so many of the figures in those conflicts end up somewhere else in the region. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1768.3s)]
*  They come from somewhere else. They are Ottoman officers that fight in Libya, then go off to be [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1775.1799999999998s)]
*  Arab nationalists in Egypt or, you know, high-ranking political figures in Iraq and so forth. There's a [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1780.4599999999998s)]
*  regional context in which much of this is happening. So, you know, the Moroccans, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1788.62s)]
*  the leaders of the Moroccan rebellions, you know, end up in Damascus. And I mean, it's quite [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1796.62s)]
*  remarkable how this is a story that is understood across these are, you know, they're borrowing [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1801.58s)]
*  ideas from each other. They're borrowing, you know, they're rooting for each other. They know [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1810.2199999999998s)]
*  what's going on in other parts of the region. These are not isolated upheavals. And I think [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1816.7s)]
*  that's another thing that we tend in focusing so much on borders in the region to forget the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1824.7s)]
*  extent to which this remains a region that has a kind of intellectual and political porousness [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1831.18s)]
*  where people are, if you will, looking over their shoulders and thinking to themselves what's going [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1839.26s)]
*  on in other parts of the region. So even if we are wherever we are at any given moment, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1843.98s)]
*  not in the midst of an uprising, we know what's going on somewhere else. So, you know, the Moroccans [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1850.22s)]
*  didn't have the same kind of upheaval as the Egyptians or the Tunisians had, but they watched [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1856.6200000000001s)]
*  it and they attended to it. And then several years later, you see the movement and the reef again [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1863.66s)]
*  reappear. There's a kind of collective activity, animation that I think was characteristic [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1871.02s)]
*  in the earlier period that Jonathan describes. And I think we neglect that in understanding what [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1883.98s)]
*  was happening then to our peril. And all the more we neglect the extent to which this continues to [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1891.1s)]
*  be important now. So I would simply say that I think there was an international level, there was [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1897.82s)]
*  a local level, and there was a regional level that was profoundly important as people tried to [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1906.22s)]
*  figure out how they wanted to organize the polity in which they lived. And partly as a result of the [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1912.78s)]
*  Ottoman legacy, but also partly because as the Arab nationalists tried to argue in the 1940s and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1921.74s)]
*  50s, there was a sense of regional community. I think that survives as well. So as we think about [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1931.02s)]
*  how particular conflicts are working themselves out today, keep in mind that they're not isolated. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1940.7s)]
*  They are part of a regional conversation about how best to organize the region as a whole. So I think [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1948.94s)]
*  the wonderful thing about this book is that it prompts us to think in those terms. And I think if [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1957.9s)]
*  we continue to think in those terms, we will be far more sophisticated in understanding the nature [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1963.9s)]
*  of politics. Thank you. Great points, Lisa, and especially pertinent regarding this sort of [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1970.3s)]
*  exchange of ideas and the cross-fertilization and the sort of fraternity among veterans, people [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1978.7s)]
*  moving across borders. And obviously something to think about today as we look at the protests in [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1985.82s)]
*  Iran and their reverberations across the region. Jonathan, I want to turn back to you to sort of [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1991.5800000000002s)]
*  unpack and provide some further details on something you mentioned. And this speaks to the idea of an [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=1999.02s)]
*  interactive process between local actors and sort of outside powers. And I think this is so important [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2005.82s)]
*  today when we confront this narrative of proxy wars in the region. I'm always fighting this in [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2013.9s)]
*  policy circles. What is a proxy? A proxy is not a passive receptacle for great power influence. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2020.38s)]
*  It's two-way. And I think that's even more important now as we're settling into this sort of [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2028.6200000000001s)]
*  frame of great power competition in the region. So I'm wondering if could you provide some examples [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2034.14s)]
*  from your book of how local actors sort of turn the tables on outside powers, whether it's Morocco, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2040.7s)]
*  the Arabian Peninsula, Kurdistan? Just take us into some details on that dynamic. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2049.02s)]
*  Yeah, sure. I think a good place to start would be the Arabian Peninsula, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2054.7000000000003s)]
*  which isn't exactly in the framework of what you're talking about, but is super [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2058.94s)]
*  important and it doesn't really follow the logics of our expectations. This is a distinct region [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2063.7400000000002s)]
*  in reference to the rest of the Mount because they effectively make one qualification. But [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2071.34s)]
*  there's one imperial or colonial power that has interests. It's the British. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2076.78s)]
*  The Italians are also making a play in the South. So I want to include that. They're anchored in [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2081.26s)]
*  Eritrea and small land and they are reaching out in Yemen to the Imam there. But outside of that, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2088.14s)]
*  it's a British space, but the British are not imposing colonial states in that area. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2097.66s)]
*  There's not a kind of sustained attempt to themselves build anything there or even [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2104.62s)]
*  there or even to provide a ton of direct support for anyone of their proxies. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2111.8999999999996s)]
*  They have a lot of proxies. Basically, they're behind everybody. They're giving money to Ibn [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2117.4199999999996s)]
*  Saud and the Naj. They're giving money to the Hashemites, Sharif Hussein and his family in the [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2122.9399999999996s)]
*  Hijaz. And they also are supporting the Idris El-Amir in Asir in the South. And there's others, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2129.9799999999996s)]
*  all of the trutial states, etc. Kuwait. So in that situation, this is what's interesting. All [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2138.86s)]
*  of those are effectively British proxies. But they don't really, well, especially the one in the Naj [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2144.06s)]
*  doesn't follow what the British want them to do and just kind of stay put and remain static. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2151.02s)]
*  Because the Saudi, this kind of core group from that central Arabian Peninsula area [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2156.38s)]
*  around Riyadh begins to expand. And through the 1920s, the British are trying over and over and [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2169.42s)]
*  over again to put a lid on it, to cap it. They threaten, they cut off their subsidies, etc. But [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2174.1400000000003s)]
*  over that period of time, the Saudi state grows and eliminates all of its rivals over time, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2179.82s)]
*  including the Kingdom of the Hijaz, which is the Faisal Hussein, the same family that the [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2187.5s)]
*  British are going to support in Transjordan by putting one of the sons, Abdullah, on the throne [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2194.3s)]
*  there. They had supported Faisal in the Arab revolt, the T.E. Lawrence story, and they ended [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2198.3s)]
*  up putting him on the throne in Iraq. And they support his father and their older brother, who [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2202.6200000000003s)]
*  succeeds his father, in Mecca and control the hijaz. And none of that, the British can't deal [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2206.7000000000003s)]
*  with the fact that they are trying to be an umpire amongst these rivals. They don't really control [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2212.78s)]
*  that. So I think that gives some sense of how dynamic and also it is very complicated. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2217.5800000000004s)]
*  The Saudis are a British client to some degree, but they have their own agenda. I don't know if [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2225.6600000000003s)]
*  this sounds familiar in the past week, how the U.S. has been trying to do anything in Saudi Arabia. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2230.78s)]
*  And that they're doing, they have their own policy, their own regional policy. And they almost [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2235.34s)]
*  provoke, the British and Italians are really worried that in the early 1930s, they're going to [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2240.1400000000003s)]
*  provoke in the conflict with Yemen, that they're actually going to, that regional local conflict is [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2244.94s)]
*  going to spiral up into something that brings those two into conflict. And they have to sit down [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2251.18s)]
*  and actually try to shut down Saudi expansion that was also going to threaten British aid at the end [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2255.3399999999997s)]
*  of the peninsula. So I think that's one complicated example. And then I think some of the other ones [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2261.18s)]
*  are that in other parts of the map, I think it's a lot of similar to some of these are just, it's [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2266.8599999999997s)]
*  just, there's a, the local polity isn't a client, it's the challenger against the colonial state. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2275.5s)]
*  So you have the local state that is merging, colonial state, and it's really that friction [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2281.02s)]
*  that's going on there. In Turkey, you have that dynamic, colonial powers trying to parcel up [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2285.18s)]
*  Anatolia. You have a local state that emerges out of the rump kind of structures of the Ottoman [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2292.06s)]
*  Empire. Mustafa Kemal is able to mobilize an administrative and military [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2296.86s)]
*  in, you know, core out of Eastern Anatolia that begins to expand and shuts, you know, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2301.34s)]
*  that anti-colonial movement kicks out the colonial aspirants there, but then that local power turns [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2307.7400000000002s)]
*  into in kind of a colonial actor in its own state building in Eastern Anatolia against the Kurdish [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2315.1000000000004s)]
*  threat there. So I think this kind of, these sort of complex relationships are the next step in [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2322.1400000000003s)]
*  the process. These sort of complex relationships are the norm, and that's the world that is in [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2329.26s)]
*  place there, and I think it's really close. I think Lisa was bringing this up, Asa was bringing [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2335.5800000000004s)]
*  this up too. That's, it is very similar to the world that we're in right now. It's a better [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2339.1800000000003s)]
*  structure in terms of the levels that it's not great power, local ground, it's multi-scalar, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2342.94s)]
*  and those scales aren't really hierarchy, as hierarchical as you would think. There's kind [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2348.94s)]
*  of a balance that we're facing together and we have to keep our eyes on that ground level. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2355.02s)]
*  Great points. Thank you very much. And so let me turn to Lisa now, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2361.2599999999998s)]
*  who's going to bring in a point from Libya. Yeah, I was just thinking about this, Jonathan, as [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2366.06s)]
*  we think about the proxies and, you know, the battles in Libya today and, you know, who's [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2372.38s)]
*  supporting which groups and so forth and so on. Well, you know, the reason why the Turks have, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2378.22s)]
*  or one important reason why the Turks have sort of privileged access to Misrata and the people who [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2385.98s)]
*  are organized in Misrata today is because they were doing that a hundred years ago. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2391.58s)]
*  They do have a hundred years of history of supporting particular groups within [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2397.1s)]
*  the western part of the country. Similarly, the Egyptians have privileged access to eastern [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2402.86s)]
*  Libya and they have had it for at least a hundred years and those kinds of relationships. So we [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2411.34s)]
*  think to ourselves, you know, here are these foreign actors interfering in Libya. And at least [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2417.82s)]
*  at the regional level, the interesting thing is that there are different, you know, sort of [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2426.46s)]
*  privileged access. So, you know, the Americans interfere in a way that is not part of that [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2432.78s)]
*  history, whereas the historical relationships between Misrata and Turkey or, you know, other [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2439.5s)]
*  kinds of, you know, Egypt and Cyrenaica and so forth, it's, they know more, they have connections, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2447.18s)]
*  there are families that are, you know, still expressing those connections and so forth today. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2455.82s)]
*  So I think what's really interesting about this is that we can, you know, it really is rhyming. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2464.1400000000003s)]
*  It really is. You can see so much of these patterns of relationships. Now, they're new entrants. The [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2470.6200000000003s)]
*  United States is, in a sense, a new entrant, not involved in the same way. And the Gulf countries [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2476.46s)]
*  are new entrants. They were not involved in the way they are now. But at the same time, they're [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2483.9s)]
*  operating in territory where there are very old established relationships between local actors and, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2490.14s)]
*  in this instance, regional actors that I think you bring out in a way that, you know, anybody who's [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2497.26s)]
*  trying to figure out what's going on now really needs to understand. So, you know, that's another [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2503.34s)]
*  example of that kind of relationship. Great points, Lisa. And on Libya, I'll just add to that. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2509.42s)]
*  When General Khalifa Haftar was in Cyrenaica, was fighting the Turks during 2019 to 2020, he was [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2516.7000000000003s)]
*  trying to claim the mantle from Omar Muqtar, and the Turks responded to him saying, no, look, we [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2523.82s)]
*  were supporting the Sunnis for quite a long time. So interesting how this narrative plays out in [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2528.86s)]
*  local conflicts today. Asli, I want to turn to you for some remarks as well. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2535.1s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted to jump in with a different dimension of the echoes or rhyming that Jonathan's [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2540.54s)]
*  book really evokes, which has to do with what happens when a new period like this one of, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2547.3399999999997s)]
*  you know, real reconfiguration and pressure on the region, the wars and destabilization of earlier [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2553.3399999999997s)]
*  agreements, opens up the space for new kinds of political imaginaries. And here, some of the actors [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2559.26s)]
*  that really emerge at the forefront of his narrative recur. These are communities that [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2565.1800000000003s)]
*  failed in their state formation projects a century ago, but now you have the kind of fluidity of [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2570.5400000000004s)]
*  borders again, or you have a rethinking of what territorial configurations might be possible. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2576.38s)]
*  And so this has really opened up, for example, Rojava. So when we look at, as he points out, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2581.9s)]
*  the Mosul question that recurs and recurs and is still present at the moment, you have the U.S. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2587.02s)]
*  partnering with one set of Kurdish actors in Iraq, but then there's another set of Kurdish actors in [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2593.9s)]
*  the same war against the Islamic State that the United States also partners with, and they're [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2597.82s)]
*  engaged in a very, very different kind of political imagination. So you have on the Kurdish side, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2601.9s)]
*  a kind of, you know, federalism that emerges in Iraq that makes possible, it's like a light [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2608.46s)]
*  version of the tripartite division that the United States imagined, asymmetric federalism makes [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2613.5s)]
*  possible some kind of a proto-state autonomous region for the Iraqi Kurds. But on the Syrian side, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2617.82s)]
*  you have a totally different sort of transnationally imagined political project that emerges on [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2624.86s)]
*  in the Syrian Kurdish territory that returns to open questions from a century earlier and basically [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2631.02s)]
*  revisits whether or not the sort of conjoining of nation and state is the appropriate way to [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2637.42s)]
*  organize political authority in the region. And this also returns to your question at the beginning, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2645.26s)]
*  Fred, about cosmopolitanism and imagine some other ways of thinking, for example, regionally or [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2650.62s)]
*  transnationally that doesn't necessarily disrupt existing borders. So the Syrian Kurdish project [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2655.26s)]
*  says we don't contest Syria's borders. We're not going to engage in an independence referendum a la [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2660.3s)]
*  Iraqi Kurdistan. Instead, we're going to imagine this democratic confederal project, which if fully [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2664.78s)]
*  expressed, would enable us to have shared institutions across all of Kurdistan, Iranian, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2670.6200000000003s)]
*  Turkish, Iraqi, and Syrian, and imagine sort of nested political commitments and identities [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2675.34s)]
*  within existing borders and beyond existing borders. And again, similarly, you have something [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2681.98s)]
*  along these lines happening in Palestine, where in the midst of the kind of complete dead end of the [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2686.3s)]
*  two-state solution and the failure of the so-called peace process and the end of the [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2691.9s)]
*  partitionings that began, that started with the Palestine mandate that again Jonathan discusses [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2696.06s)]
*  so brilliantly in the book, now you have the opening up of other possibilities. And so you [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2703.42s)]
*  have all kinds of one-state, binational, again, in some instances, confederal ideas that have emerged. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2708.14s)]
*  And once more in Western Sahara, another good example of stateless community that is contesting [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2714.54s)]
*  current configurations and has sought to use the Arab uprisings moment, although as Jonathan [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2721.58s)]
*  rightly describes it at the conclusion of his book, a moment that was sort of underscored by [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2727.26s)]
*  deep counterrevolution and co-optation strategies in the Moroccan context that are very much [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2733.02s)]
*  affecting Western Sahara. But nonetheless, you have the Sahrawis also articulating alternative [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2738.54s)]
*  political visions for what their communities, political institutional arrangements might look [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2743.42s)]
*  like. So all of these border lands, if you want, of that original long, both geographically expanded [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2749.34s)]
*  and temporally broadened long great war that Jonathan narrates, are emerging again a century [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2756.94s)]
*  later in order to see if there's a way that the political configurations once imagined could now [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2763.7400000000002s)]
*  be reconfigured in some way to suit our current moment. And they themselves come with their own [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2769.82s)]
*  contestations, forms of violence, contemporary expressions of the very same kinds of dynamics [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2775.1000000000004s)]
*  that we had seen a century earlier. And I think they even map on to some of Lisa's points around [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2781.5s)]
*  regionalism by imagining themselves as embedded, not just trapped in the nation states that were [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2785.5s)]
*  eventually the product of the struggles Jonathan narrates, but also as connected regionally in ways [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2791.34s)]
*  that they might now deploy in their own defense. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2796.94s)]
*  Terrific. Thank you. Excellent points. And we could keep going forever. But I do want to open it up to our audience for [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2799.82s)]
*  questions. To ask a question, you can use the live chat feature in YouTube. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2806.94s)]
*  So we'll give a moment for questions. Okay. So here's a question, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2815.34s)]
*  starting with you, Jonathan, but we'll open it up to everybody. How do you [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2822.38s)]
*  So again, I think it's drilling down into the Kurdish issue. How do you interpret the place of the Kurds [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2826.6200000000003s)]
*  who have boundaries, have some boundaries, not as a nation state, but cover a region that includes [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2832.6200000000003s)]
*  Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, I guess. So Jonathan, walk us through the Kurdish issue and its relevance [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2838.54s)]
*  today. I'm gonna do that in like two minutes. Yeah, sure. Go quick. Yeah, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2845.7400000000002s)]
*  the Kurds, one of the things about the book is the story is oriented around different kind of anchor points than it might be, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2851.42s)]
*  or they're expanded to include other anchor points. And one of the anchor points of this book is definitely the Kurdish [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2859.26s)]
*  zone. So the Torres Mountains, this kind of inter, you know, it is, there's a geo strategic and a topographic dimension to this [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2865.1s)]
*  question in the present or in the past, that this is an area that has been between strong central states for a really long time [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2876.22s)]
*  and remains so. It's bisect, it's quadraseconded right now into different, you know, Iran, Turkey, Iraq, and Syria. And I think [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2884.22s)]
*  I'll just make two comments about that. Because again, we could spend two more hours on the seminar. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2896.8599999999997s)]
*  Talking about that. But you have, building off of Asli's points, I think the Kurds are expressing a multiplicity of political imaginaries right now, including the Kurdish regional government, which is kind of right, an ethno national, neoliberal [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2901.98s)]
*  aspiration within the rules of kind of a nation state. Rojava is expressing a very different alternative. The PKK and the [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2916.62s)]
*  in Turkey, and their claims are being made there again are a moving target. They have expressed various futures that they are shooting for, but effectively challenging [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2924.22s)]
*  right, the configuration of a Turkish national project that has more, has had some modifications, but has been in place for the past few years. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2935.74s)]
*  And I think what's, it's important to recognize that there is that diversity amongst that, but there is also kind of an overarching feeling of solidarity and simultaneous aspirations for some, there would be an aspiration for some sort of a [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2944.54s)]
*  pan Kurdish political [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2955.82s)]
*  But those things all operate at the same time, and they operate in very complex ways. And I just wanted to throw in my last comment [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2958.14s)]
*  is the ways that Iranian Kurdistan, right, Eastern Kurdistan, is also very much in the mix, and the protests in Iran right now. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2966.46s)]
*  I mean, what's going on there? I mean, there's a lot of different kinds of, there's a lot of different kinds of issues that are happening. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2975.1s)]
*  Iranian Kurdistan, right? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2982.38s)]
*  Eastern Kurdistan is also very much in the mix. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2983.78s)]
*  And the protests in Iran right now come out of the, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2986.2200000000003s)]
*  Mahsa Amini is Kurdish and she was in Tehran [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2990.7400000000002s)]
*  and the integration of Iranian Kurdistan into both, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2994.42s)]
*  it's a both-and, both integrated into the Iranian, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=2997.02s)]
*  Iranian political container and all the dynamics there, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3000.5s)]
*  but it is also cross border. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3002.86s)]
*  And so that's the difficult, but kind of fascinating thing [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3004.46s)]
*  about how the Kurdish context works. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3008.06s)]
*  Terrific, thank you. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3012.98s)]
*  Asli and Lisa, anything to add on this point? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3015.26s)]
*  Maybe I'll just add one thing, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3020.26s)]
*  which is that I think it's a fascinating fact [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3021.42s)]
*  about the current moment that some of the most exciting [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3023.9s)]
*  sort of political projects and sort of emancipatory ideas [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3027.36s)]
*  about how political authority can be reconfigured [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3031.54s)]
*  in the region are emerging from its stateless communities, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3034.1s)]
*  including the Kurdish community in Syria, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3036.42s)]
*  as we're seeing the importance [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3039.98s)]
*  of the Kurdish community in Iran in enabling [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3041.5s)]
*  or in sparking and supporting the protest movement [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3044.46s)]
*  that we're seeing there. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3048.3s)]
*  And then as I've said already, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3049.14s)]
*  the Palestinian example as well. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3050.06s)]
*  So it's just, there's a whole other story to be told [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3052.66s)]
*  about the ways in which the idea of national identity [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3056.86s)]
*  or nation state formation has done violence globally, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3060.74s)]
*  but also in this region and the ways in which [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3064.86s)]
*  those national communities without a state [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3068.18s)]
*  are able to think their way into different configurations, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3070.5s)]
*  including transnational and regional ones [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3074.38s)]
*  that may be a path forward going, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3076.18s)]
*  as we project into the next long century. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3078.9s)]
*  Great, so while we're waiting for the next question, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3084.74s)]
*  Jonathan, can I just press you a bit more [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3087.02s)]
*  on the sort of global dimension of your book? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3088.82s)]
*  And the period that you cover the 20s and the 30s [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3091.74s)]
*  were a period of tremendous ideological upheaval [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3095.02s)]
*  at the global level. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3098.9s)]
*  There's a lot of ideologies, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3100.54s)]
*  Bolshevism, anti-fascism, pan-Islamism, pan-Africanism. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3102.42s)]
*  And looking at the case of the Reef Republic, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3105.98s)]
*  Abdel-Kharim Khatabi and the article that I wrote [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3109.78s)]
*  that you helpfully reviewed, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3112.14s)]
*  you talk about it in your book. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3114.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, Khatabi had an audience in places like Brazil, Japan, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3115.46s)]
*  you had French leftists demonstrating [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3121.22s)]
*  on his behalf in Paris, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3124.2599999999998s)]
*  you had pan-Africanism resonating in Harlem. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3125.62s)]
*  Someone like Marcus Garvey was applauding him [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3130.02s)]
*  as an African liberator. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3133.74s)]
*  So I wonder if you could bring in [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3135.68s)]
*  that sort of global dimension to this [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3136.9s)]
*  and how that mapped onto these struggles. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3139.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's precisely, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3144.2599999999998s)]
*  it was fascinating to see the ways that these very, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3145.62s)]
*  very concrete, very local, very grounded movements [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3149.38s)]
*  and something that's also interesting, very rural. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3152.9s)]
*  This is not, a lot of the stories in the book [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3156.1s)]
*  are not happening in a big regional urban center, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3157.46s)]
*  but they're out of rural areas. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3160.54s)]
*  So the political agency and the political significance [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3162.7s)]
*  of those that do resonate globally [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3165.9s)]
*  and through these networks, through press, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3168.54s)]
*  through fundraising, there's also fundraising [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3170.7799999999997s)]
*  for the Reef Republic that extends across the spaces [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3173.32s)]
*  used from South America to Indonesia, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3175.62s)]
*  across the Middle East region. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3179.62s)]
*  And then the resonance as a kind of global frames [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3181.9s)]
*  of anti-imperialism, anti-Westernism in it, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3184.1s)]
*  in this Wilsonian moment that has been recognized, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3187.46s)]
*  the fact that there's all kinds of South South ideas [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3190.82s)]
*  about reshaping the post, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3196.78s)]
*  that's not gonna be a post-imperial world, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3200.86s)]
*  but a post-World War among imperial powers world [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3202.4s)]
*  that's happening there, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3206.7000000000003s)]
*  and those synergies that are not limited back to some, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3208.42s)]
*  Lisa was talking about how the region itself [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3212.18s)]
*  really works together a lot, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3213.54s)]
*  but that the region itself is nested [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3215.18s)]
*  in this larger global frame [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3217.02s)]
*  that incorporates these other parts of that. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3219.06s)]
*  And I think that is just another takeaway, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3221.46s)]
*  hopefully is that we don't have these fixed containers [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3225.14s)]
*  that are hermetically sealed, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3229.76s)]
*  like the Middle East is not an area [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3230.86s)]
*  that's hermetically sealed off [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3232.22s)]
*  from what's happening around the Black Sea. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3233.3s)]
*  I think right now we're in a moment [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3235.18s)]
*  where you can see how Russian, Eurasian, et cetera, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3236.58s)]
*  those dynamics that are very long 19th century [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3242.4s)]
*  leading up to World War I, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3246.04s)]
*  dynamics that are very much the present 21st century [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3247.88s)]
*  dynamics on both levels, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3250.8s)]
*  both from below and the imperial actors. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3252.76s)]
*  Very good, thank you. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3259.16s)]
*  Okay, so we've got another question. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3260.36s)]
*  How much does the Greater Israel Project [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3262.26s)]
*  contribute to the current crisis in Syria and Lebanon? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3265.8s)]
*  Jonathan. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3271.96s)]
*  Guys give me hard questions, okay. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3274.2s)]
*  How I'll answer that. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3282.12s)]
*  Let me start from the past. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3283.3s)]
*  I think one of the points, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3284.48s)]
*  and also is bringing this up about the present [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3285.32s)]
*  sort of recalculations of political claims and futures [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3288.08s)]
*  and just where post two state solution [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3292.96s)]
*  Palestinian mobilization is right now. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3297.6s)]
*  I think that ties into a point [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3300.3s)]
*  that's related to this question, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3301.42s)]
*  which is how much, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3303.54s)]
*  I have a strong statement, [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3307.3s)]
*  which would be that the container doesn't matter. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3310.7400000000002s)]
*  So the drawing of the borders, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3313.38s)]
*  and this is I'm gonna be a little, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3314.7400000000002s)]
*  I'll exaggerate a little bit. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3316.48s)]
*  I think it does matter a little bit, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3317.46s)]
*  but it really doesn't matter that much [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3319.1800000000003s)]
*  what the container is. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3321.5s)]
*  So whether it's Greater Israel, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3323.0600000000004s)]
*  historically, which is the aspiration [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3325.3s)]
*  for a Jewish national home [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3327.0s)]
*  that would encompass the West Bank [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3328.34s)]
*  between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3332.5s)]
*  and the East Bank, what modern day Jordan, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3334.82s)]
*  or however far that would extend into Syria. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3337.2200000000003s)]
*  That both for the Zionists, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3340.06s)]
*  and there's debate among the Zionists [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3343.02s)]
*  at that point over that, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3344.94s)]
*  and for the Palestinians [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3347.1000000000004s)]
*  and for other members of Greater Syria [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3348.54s)]
*  in the late 19 teens and 20s, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3351.04s)]
*  they have various configurations of, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3354.46s)]
*  they have maximalist configurations, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3357.62s)]
*  and then just the reality. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3359.7799999999997s)]
*  So what gets forged over time. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3361.18s)]
*  And within any of those, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3362.98s)]
*  the point there is the politics that happened in there. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3364.1s)]
*  It's the political systems, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3365.94s)]
*  it's the political structures, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3367.14s)]
*  political exclusions, et cetera, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3368.14s)]
*  or integration, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3369.74s)]
*  that that is actually the point, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3371.18s)]
*  or it's both, if you're gonna diagnose a problem, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3373.14s)]
*  it's the legacies over time [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3376.74s)]
*  and where we are in the present with regard to those. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3378.22s)]
*  And so fixing whatever's wrong [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3380.46s)]
*  has to do with changing those structures [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3382.8399999999997s)]
*  rather than changing space. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3384.2599999999998s)]
*  So I think this is something to do. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3386.18s)]
*  I'll leave it there perhaps, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3388.5s)]
*  because I won't get into, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3389.58s)]
*  I think there's a different question, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3391.1s)]
*  which is Israel interventionist policy and its neighbors [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3392.3199999999997s)]
*  and how it relates to both Lebanon and Syria [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3396.4199999999996s)]
*  and also Syria as a kind of proxy, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3401.4199999999996s)]
*  back to that idea of proxy terrain [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3404.2999999999997s)]
*  in which Israel and Iran work out their rivalry [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3406.8599999999997s)]
*  is another question. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3410.74s)]
*  I think that's really important, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3412.2999999999997s)]
*  but on the internal domestic side of this, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3414.38s)]
*  my point would be the boundaries of Palestine or Israel are, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3417.78s)]
*  we've seen Israel's both expanded and contracted [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3422.78s)]
*  for over the past 60 years, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3425.2200000000003s)]
*  and that has been a part of that history, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3426.94s)]
*  but I don't think that the container itself [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3430.7000000000003s)]
*  is less of a central question [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3432.78s)]
*  than the politics within the container. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3435.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know, Asli, if you wanted to follow up with any. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3439.3s)]
*  I'll just say one thing quickly on this, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3442.46s)]
*  which is that you, Fred and Jonathan, in your exchange, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3444.54s)]
*  you discussed the ways in which Saudi, Turkey, Iran, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3449.14s)]
*  were these great regional hegemons [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3452.32s)]
*  that formed basically in the long great war, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3454.26s)]
*  and then the missing factor there is Israel, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3457.06s)]
*  which is the other great regional hegemon [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3460.18s)]
*  formed also out of the sort of crucible [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3462.1s)]
*  that you described, Jonathan, in the book, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3463.96s)]
*  and it's really the now clash between, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3466.04s)]
*  I would say actually Iran and Saudi [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3470.04s)]
*  that are defining the sort of trajectory [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3473.2200000000003s)]
*  of Lebanon and Syria, but the truth of it is [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3475.02s)]
*  that Israel is now actually aligned [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3477.7000000000003s)]
*  in one of these two axes very clearly [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3480.1000000000004s)]
*  and is one of the important drivers, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3482.3s)]
*  and so rather than the Greater Israel Project [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3483.9s)]
*  or exactly how Israel's borders are to be configured, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3485.82s)]
*  it's really this broader set of regional dynamics [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3488.82s)]
*  in which these competitive rivalries [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3491.7000000000003s)]
*  have congealed into blocks [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3493.58s)]
*  that are competing against one another in proxies, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3496.2200000000003s)]
*  as you've said, Jonathan, particularly intensely [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3498.34s)]
*  in Syria and Lebanon, that means that, for example, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3501.04s)]
*  it's very difficult for a Lebanese government to form [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3503.88s)]
*  so long as you have both Iran and Saudi Israel [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3506.3s)]
*  or Gulf Israel axis competing in the ways [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3510.44s)]
*  that they are on that territory, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3513.4s)]
*  and similarly, you continue to have the reverberations [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3515.24s)]
*  of that competition in Syria, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3518.4s)]
*  so what's happening internally in Syria and Lebanon [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3520.06s)]
*  is difficult to explain without placing it [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3522.72s)]
*  in that broader regional context, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3524.64s)]
*  and Israel now plays a role in that regional context [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3525.92s)]
*  that I think is somewhat novel to this century [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3528.84s)]
*  as compared to the kind of role Israel played [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3532.6000000000004s)]
*  in Lebanon and Syria in the 20th century. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3534.44s)]
*  Great, thank you so much. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3539.48s)]
*  Fred, if I may, I just want to extend something [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3540.96s)]
*  that Osli said on this front. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3544.7200000000003s)]
*  One of the things that's really interesting [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3546.78s)]
*  is some of the regimes using the existence [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3549.6000000000004s)]
*  of stateless populations, formally or de facto [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3555.6s)]
*  stateless populations for the purposes of intervening [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3561.64s)]
*  or not intervening or not being able to do certain things [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3567.44s)]
*  or so forth and so on, so there's a very interesting, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3570.44s)]
*  again, echo of 100 years of sort of saying, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3574.36s)]
*  these people are gonna have rights [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3578.36s)]
*  and these people aren't gonna have rights, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3579.6s)]
*  and these people are gonna have rights here [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3581.2s)]
*  and these people aren't gonna have rights there, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3583.0s)]
*  and so forth, so I think Osli's saying [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3584.36s)]
*  that there's some kind of intellectual dynamism in there, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3587.6800000000003s)]
*  I think is particularly interesting [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3592.48s)]
*  because of course you see a sort of very [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3594.1200000000003s)]
*  transactional political arrangements among governments [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3599.46s)]
*  in the Gulf, for example, in Israel, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3605.4s)]
*  who agree on not wanting to have, you know, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3607.6400000000003s)]
*  extend citizenship to all sorts of people [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3611.6400000000003s)]
*  that they don't really wanna have to be responsible for [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3613.96s)]
*  or accountable to, and then, so, you know, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3616.52s)]
*  again, there's this sort of set of arrangements [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3620.4s)]
*  among people who, when the music stopped, had states [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3623.36s)]
*  and people who, when the music stops, didn't, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3627.52s)]
*  and I just, you know, that's part of what this story [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3631.52s)]
*  for today is of kind of who ultimately were able [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3635.26s)]
*  to capture the states that were, you know, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3641.26s)]
*  the legacy of this period and who were not, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3646.34s)]
*  and how is that dynamic playing out now, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3649.42s)]
*  so I think you can see it in, you know, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3651.5800000000004s)]
*  all across the region, but in this particular instance, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3655.3s)]
*  I think you see it right there with Israel [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3658.26s)]
*  and the countries of the Gulf. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3661.2200000000003s)]
*  That's a great point to end on, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3665.86s)]
*  and I was actually gonna ask a question [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3667.78s)]
*  on how regimes have instrumentalized this narrative, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3669.46s)]
*  but we have run out of time, unfortunately. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3672.62s)]
*  I wanna thank all three of you for a very stimulating [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3675.34s)]
*  and illuminating discussion. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3679.06s)]
*  Jonathan, congratulations on a fine book. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3681.26s)]
*  I hope it gets placed on syllabi [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3684.1s)]
*  and gets read by policymakers. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3686.34s)]
*  I'm sure this isn't the final word, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3688.54s)]
*  but it's a major contribution, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3689.94s)]
*  and you're to be commended for really telling a great story. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3692.46s)]
*  It's a great readable account as well. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3696.06s)]
*  Thanks to our audience for joining us [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3699.06s)]
*  and for your questions, and goodbye for now. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3701.2599999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much, Fred. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3704.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtW9uO7DlnI&t=3705.78s)]
