# Wehrey on U.S.-Iranian-Saudi Relations
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [May 20, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20)
*  The Iran-Saudi relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=0.0s)]
*  today. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=13.24s)]
*  This is a strategic rivalry that affects virtually every region of the Middle East, and it impacts [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=14.24s)]
*  U.S. interests in the Middle East. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=19.16s)]
*  The big question is how long will this rivalry go on? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=22.76s)]
*  Will the two states ever reach some sort of compromise or equilibrium? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=26.32s)]
*  Our findings suggest that they won't. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=31.68s)]
*  The two states are on opposite sides of virtually every issue in the region. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=33.24s)]
*  In Syria, they're supporting opposing factions. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=38.2s)]
*  In Lebanon, in Bahrain, they're vying for influence in Iraq. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=42.0s)]
*  But more importantly is the question of the U.S. presence in the region. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=46.6s)]
*  The Iranians historically have called for the removal of the U.S. from the region. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=50.6s)]
*  And the Saudis, as the weaker of the two states, has always demanded that the U.S. be present [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=55.52s)]
*  in the region to balance the Iranians. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=60.24s)]
*  So this is a fundamental asymmetry. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  Recently, in the wake of the Iran-U.S. nuclear deal, many commentators have forecasted that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=65.36s)]
*  the U.S. may actually be edging closer to Iran on a number of issues and that the U.S.-Iranian [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=71.16s)]
*  partnership may eventually supplant the U.S.-Saudi strategic relationship. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=76.88s)]
*  This is a distant dream. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=82.44s)]
*  This is really tactical cooperation between the U.S. and Iran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  And at the strategic level, there's still confrontation between the two states. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=87.2s)]
*  With the U.S.-Saudi relationship, we're undergoing a period of tactical disagreement, tactical [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=92.0s)]
*  turbulence. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=97.36s)]
*  But the fundamental pillars of the relationship, strategic cooperation, remain very, very strong. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=98.44s)]
*  Historically, there have been periods where Saudi Arabia and Iran have bridged their differences [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=104.12s)]
*  and cooperated. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=109.22s)]
*  If you look at these periods, it's when the region around them has been relatively settled. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=110.4s)]
*  And that is not the case today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=115.32s)]
*  As long as Syria is festering as a conflict, it's inviting competition and conflict between [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=117.12s)]
*  these two powers. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U21lMqTwQ20&t=122.88s)]
