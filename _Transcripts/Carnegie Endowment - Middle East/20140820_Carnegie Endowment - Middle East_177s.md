# Dunne on What Is Fueling Terrorism in Egypt
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [August 20, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc)
*  Egypt has a significant domestic terrorism problem, the most significant problem it has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=0.0s)]
*  had since at least the 1990s. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  The question though is whether the policies of the Egyptian government since the military [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=16.64s)]
*  coup are fighting terrorism or fueling it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=21.68s)]
*  Since the summer of 2013, at least 36,000 Egyptians have been put in detention primarily [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=25.54s)]
*  for political reasons, mostly for participating in demonstrations against the military coup. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=32.14s)]
*  Not all of them are still being held, but a very large number, perhaps 20,000 or so, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=39.22s)]
*  are still being held. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=44.22s)]
*  In the courtrooms, what we're seeing is mass trials as the justice system tries to process [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=45.44s)]
*  this very large number of people, 100, sometimes 500, 600 people being tried at the same time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=51.34s)]
*  There's not even really a veneer of justice in these trials. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=58.46s)]
*  There are also some other very serious problems in Egypt that are leading to perhaps increased [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=62.1s)]
*  support for extremism. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=69.34s)]
*  Islamists, whether from the Muslim Brotherhood, the movement associated with the ousted president, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=71.66s)]
*  Mohammed Morsi, or other Islamists, have been largely excluded from politics, from the writing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=77.02s)]
*  of a new constitution, from the media, from civil society, even from commerce. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=83.46s)]
*  In addition to what's going on inside of all of Egypt, there's a particularly intense situation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=88.78s)]
*  in the Sinai Peninsula. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=94.46s)]
*  This has always been a lightly governed area and one in which there's been a lot of crime, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=96.58s)]
*  a lot of smuggling, and so forth. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=101.34s)]
*  But now we're really seeing a proliferation of extremists inside the Sinai, and the Egyptian [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=103.94s)]
*  authorities are responding to this with a very heavy-handed campaign that involves collective [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=110.53999999999999s)]
*  punishment against entire communities in the Sinai. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=116.7s)]
*  We know from other experiences worldwide that in order to counter an insurgency effectively, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=120.66s)]
*  authorities need to get the cooperation of the local population against the extremists. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=127.46s)]
*  Egyptian authorities are not doing this. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=132.26s)]
*  They are not adopting the kind of political and economic strategies in the Sinai, as well [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=134.38s)]
*  as elsewhere in Egypt, that could help them get the cooperation of local people against extremists. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=140.02s)]
*  If the United States is going to help Egypt in fighting terrorism and even provide weapons [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=147.46s)]
*  and technical assistance and so forth, it should be just as serious about pressing the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=153.62s)]
*  Egyptian government to reopen political space, reopen media, civil society, and so forth, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=159.46s)]
*  so there can be peaceful expression of different political views and real political competition. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRQX43_ULYc&t=165.9s)]
