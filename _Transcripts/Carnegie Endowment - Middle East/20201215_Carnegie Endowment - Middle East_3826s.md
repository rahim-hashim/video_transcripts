# International Actors in the Emerging Middle East: Russia, China, and the EU
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [December 15, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE)
*  Good morning or good evening everyone. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=60.0s)]
*  My name is Patricia Karam. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=63.0s)]
*  I'm regional director at the International Republican Institute, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=64.44s)]
*  where I oversee a portfolio of programs that's focused on citizen responsive governance. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=69.0s)]
*  This panel today will explore the expanding influence of [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=74.8s)]
*  external actors like Russia, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=79.4s)]
*  the European Union, and China in the Middle East. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  The alliances they formed and the dynamics they've unleashed by their interventions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=83.84s)]
*  Our panelists will also look at how changes in the policies of the US may impact these dynamics. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=88.7s)]
*  For some context at IRI, we're very interested in the role and influence of external powers like China and Russia, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=94.94s)]
*  especially in undermining progress in fragile democracies. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=101.5s)]
*  We're also interested in the impact of Chinese and Russian disinformation, plus Iranian, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=105.30000000000001s)]
*  on perceptions of democracy in the US and the attractiveness of a more authoritarian model of governance, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  especially where COVID responses have been concerned. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=117.34s)]
*  So this is with great excitement that I'm turning to the panel today, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  which involves four, which has four distinguished speakers joining us. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=125.38000000000001s)]
*  And thank you to Carnegie for bringing us together. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=131.04s)]
*  Our four speakers are Evan Feigenbaum, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=134.58s)]
*  who is the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=139.04s)]
*  Florence Gau, who's the deputy director of the EU ISS, where she's in charge of research. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=143.98s)]
*  Mark Pierini, who's a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, whose research also focuses on Turkey. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=151.22s)]
*  And Dimitri Trenin, who's the director of Carnegie Moscow Center and has been at the center for a while. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=159.17999999999998s)]
*  The session will be structured as a Q&A that will integrate some of my questions [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  and some of the audience's questions, especially towards the end. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=172.42s)]
*  I've asked the panelists to limit their responses to about one to three minutes per question. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=176.01999999999998s)]
*  So without further ado, if I may turn to Dimitri and look a little bit very briefly at Russia. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=183.32s)]
*  And let me ask you, taking into account that over the last five years, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=191.82s)]
*  Russia's involvement in the Middle East has expanded. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=197.32s)]
*  How do you evaluate Russia's legacy in the region during this period? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=201.06s)]
*  Well, thank you, Patricia. Thank you also for coming to me first. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=206.86s)]
*  Well, Russia is not a new actor. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=213.66s)]
*  It was in the Middle East, was very much involved in Middle Eastern affairs as the Soviet Union. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=217.06s)]
*  Prior to that, as the Russian Empire, it was also present in parts of the Middle East. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=222.16s)]
*  Now, with regard to Russia's legacy of the last five years, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=227.46s)]
*  I would say that, A, it has been able to establish or reestablish, to be exact, its presence in the region. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  Second, it has seen its status as a major power confirmed. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=241.26000000000002s)]
*  If you can wage war in the Middle East and not lose for five years, then I think you qualify as a major power. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=247.86s)]
*  I think it has also impressed people by standing by its allies, in this case, Bashar al-Assad and Damascus. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=256.86s)]
*  It has demonstrated a capable military in conjunction with a competent diplomatic service, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=266.56s)]
*  which I think is a great combination. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=275.46s)]
*  It has been able to form temporary alignments, not alliances, of course, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=279.76000000000005s)]
*  but alignments with countries such as Turkey and Iran. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=287.46000000000004s)]
*  It has been able to stay on speaking terms with just about everyone in the region, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=292.16s)]
*  including, say, Israel and Iran at the same time. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=297.86s)]
*  And it has been able to de-conflict with the United States of America, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=301.96000000000004s)]
*  separating the same country, not exactly on the same side, in Syria, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=307.36s)]
*  and yet being able, alongside the United States, not to step on the other guy's toes. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=313.66s)]
*  I would stop here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=321.16s)]
*  If I may ask you a follow-up question, what do you feel are the implications of its ongoing involvement [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=324.86s)]
*  and what do you see as being Moscow's ambitions in the Middle East moving into 2021? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=331.06s)]
*  Well, I think in 2021, what they're doing is not just keeping their military and political presence, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=337.46000000000004s)]
*  but expanding it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=344.66s)]
*  Just a couple of days ago, Russia and Iran signed a deal about a Russian naval facility at Port Sudan, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=346.56s)]
*  which is right in the middle of the Red Sea coast, a very strategic position. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=360.06s)]
*  This is expansion of Russian presence. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=366.36s)]
*  I think Russia will be keeping what it has achieved, particularly in Syria, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  and it will work toward some kind of a political settlement in Syria, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=377.15999999999997s)]
*  but the expectations are not very high. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=383.96s)]
*  It's the Astana process that Russia is part of, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=388.96s)]
*  and they understand that there are forces that are acting against that, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=391.76000000000005s)]
*  and some of those forces may be even sitting in Damascus. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=399.36s)]
*  So it's a complicated situation, but the footprint is somewhat expanding. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  I am myself very interested in Syria, so I can't help but follow up by asking you, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=412.36s)]
*  if you can talk a little bit about Russian policy towards Syria [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=417.96000000000004s)]
*  and where Russia stands with respect in particular to the Assad regime. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=421.56s)]
*  One question that comes to mind is under which circumstances might Moscow sacrifice Assad, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=427.56s)]
*  and would it be able to do so, or is it able to do so? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=433.76s)]
*  Well, I've been hearing the question about Russia sacrificing, dropping Assad for five years now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=438.36s)]
*  I don't think this is very high on Kremlin's agenda. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=444.06s)]
*  They have no illusions about Bashar al-Assad, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=449.66s)]
*  but they would be prepared to embrace a Syria without Bashar al-Assad [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  if there is a favorable political settlement that would be based on an agreement [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=463.16s)]
*  that Russia is trying to work out through the Astana process. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=472.96000000000004s)]
*  And then any departure of Bashar al-Assad would have to be an honorable departure, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=476.56s)]
*  a departure that would not run against the will of Bashar himself, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=484.26s)]
*  and it would not exclude the forces for which Bashar is a champion from the future settlement of Syria. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=493.56s)]
*  So the issue is not Russia dropping Bashar. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=505.46s)]
*  The issue is getting Bashar to accept power sharing, and that is hard. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=509.46s)]
*  So Russia is more concerned about getting Bashar to accept a Syria [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=515.0600000000001s)]
*  in which he and his clan, his party, do not hold 100% of power, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=521.76s)]
*  that they are able and willing to collaborate with other political forces in Syria. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=528.76s)]
*  And that Syria, which would be friendly to Russia, is Russia's ideal, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=535.1600000000001s)]
*  but it's very hard to get there. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=541.36s)]
*  I think that people realize that in Moscow. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=544.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=550.86s)]
*  Thank you, Dimitri. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=551.76s)]
*  I'd like to just shift a little bit direction and ask Mark. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=552.76s)]
*  I know, Mark, you've written extensively about Turkey and its increasing adventurism [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=557.16s)]
*  and maybe even adversarial actions, its aggressive stance towards the Eastern. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=562.26s)]
*  Before we turn to Turkey completely, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=567.16s)]
*  I'd like to maybe see if you can talk about Russia's priorities [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=570.06s)]
*  and or EU perception of Moscow's priorities vis-à-vis the Mediterranean in particular, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=575.66s)]
*  in addition to sort of what is the EU perception of the Moscow Ankara duet [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=582.3599999999999s)]
*  and the problems it poses to Europe. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=588.26s)]
*  Yes, I think from Brussels' perspective, which is EU and NATO headquarters as well, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=591.56s)]
*  you have to get together this year and last year in the Mediterranean and Middle East. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=598.56s)]
*  One is Russia, the other is Turkey. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=604.8599999999999s)]
*  These are two actors who are much more present now than they were only a few years ago. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=607.4599999999999s)]
*  Russia has boots on the ground, has facilities, bases in Syria, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=617.8599999999999s)]
*  one navy, one air force, using them as stepping stone to Libya, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=626.06s)]
*  smaller presence in Libya, but still, Al Juffra and Syrians. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=631.4599999999999s)]
*  In a way, it is strange relationship that Dimitri touched upon between Turkey and Russia. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=636.66s)]
*  We have convergences in some cases or sharp differences in other cases. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=643.56s)]
*  But essentially, you can see that Russia has used Turkey to facilitate its presence in the region. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=649.06s)]
*  One example, Turkey is a NATO member, but has granted the Russian air force [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=658.56s)]
*  all flight rights to their base in near Latakia in Syria, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=663.06s)]
*  which is a stepping stone to go on forward to Libya or other places, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=668.56s)]
*  let alone, of course, what was discussed in the previous panel, the deployment of S-400 missiles. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=675.56s)]
*  So you have, from a European point of view, once again, a major stake in the region, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=681.56s)]
*  but a much bigger presence of Russia in the fields that matter most to the EU. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=689.06s)]
*  One is security. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=697.56s)]
*  Terrorism is one. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=699.56s)]
*  For example, Syrian jihadists transported by both Turkey and Russia to Libya. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=701.56s)]
*  You have oil and gas, where, of course, Russia is a major player via Turkey through TurkStream [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=707.56s)]
*  and southeastern Europe, but also offshore in Egypt, offshore in Lebanon, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=714.56s)]
*  and surely with an eye on the Libyan resources. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=722.56s)]
*  On the other field, the EU is, of course, concerned by what is happening in the Sahel, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=728.06s)]
*  and of course, there, the security and stability of Libya is very important, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=734.06s)]
*  from both a terrorism point of view, but also a migration point of view. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=740.56s)]
*  So all this tells you that this renewed, enhanced presence of Russia in the region, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=745.06s)]
*  including possibly with a permanent military base in Libya, is something very big for the EU. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=752.56s)]
*  And in confronting this so far, the EU has basically been the absent actor, if you want. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=760.56s)]
*  Very big paradox because, as I explained, terrorism, energy, refugees, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=770.56s)]
*  these are phenomena where you have direct EU interests, like in migration, refugees, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=778.06s)]
*  where the EU is the first impacted region, but the EU has not drawn the conclusion [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=786.06s)]
*  that it has a major reason to be present in that particular area. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=794.06s)]
*  This may change under the Biden administration because one of the reasons [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=801.06s)]
*  is that we will for sure break with four years of unprecedented unpredictability [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=807.56s)]
*  of the Trump presidency, so there is strong hope. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=816.56s)]
*  Four days ago, the European Council of Heads of State and Government [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=819.56s)]
*  said that they were looking forward to a renewed dialogue with the US. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=822.56s)]
*  And because the impact of Russia's presence in the Mediterranean, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=826.56s)]
*  plus of course Russia's posture vis-à-vis NATO, is so huge, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=832.06s)]
*  probably we'll see more dialogue between Washington and Brussels. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=837.06s)]
*  So if I may ask you to talk maybe a little bit about this [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=847.06s)]
*  because it ties into my next question, which had to do with, again, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=850.06s)]
*  the prospects of US-EU reconnection after January 20, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=853.06s)]
*  and whether this, and we may be getting ahead of ourselves in terms of the panel, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=858.06s)]
*  but it would be interesting to explore at this point [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=863.06s)]
*  whether this could trigger an area of more confident relations [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=865.06s)]
*  and maybe more policy coordination on both. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=868.06s)]
*  Well, yes, you will remember that the first big event [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=872.06s)]
*  between the Trump presidency and European leaders was at the NATO summit, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=878.06s)]
*  like four months after Trump came to power. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=884.56s)]
*  And basically it was so disruptive, not only in terms of you got to spend more, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=888.56s)]
*  but also in terms of not listening to the conversation at all, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=894.56s)]
*  that Chancellor Merkel came out of the meeting and said, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=899.56s)]
*  well, now for our security, we Europeans have to understand that we are on our own. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=902.56s)]
*  I mean, I'm paraphrasing, obviously. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=907.56s)]
*  But so far, as you've seen, because of a number of reasons, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=910.06s)]
*  one being that not all EU member states or all Europeans in NATO are equal, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=915.06s)]
*  some have been military, some are not. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=922.06s)]
*  In the meantime, you have Brexit happening. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=925.06s)]
*  And in Germany, you still have this post-World War II debate [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=928.06s)]
*  on the side of the military on foreign operations. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=932.06s)]
*  So this has not happened. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=935.56s)]
*  And Chancellor Merkel was right. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=938.06s)]
*  And that was four years ago. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=941.06s)]
*  So this may change now. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=944.06s)]
*  After all, Donald Trump was the first American president in the last 70 years [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=949.06s)]
*  since the creation of NATO and the launching of the first effort towards European integration [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=957.06s)]
*  to be open to Europe. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=963.06s)]
*  He said so in so many ways, be it BMW cars or whatever. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=966.56s)]
*  So he has destabilised, really, the European leaders. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=972.56s)]
*  And of course, this has had consequences in the Middle East. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=978.56s)]
*  You've seen the way in which, abruptly, against the advice of most in his administration, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=982.06s)]
*  Trump withdrew troops from North East Syria, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=989.06s)]
*  where France and the UK had troops together with US special forces. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=993.06s)]
*  This kind of thing has had a terrible impact in terms of confidence, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=998.56s)]
*  but of course, in terms of efficiency. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1003.56s)]
*  So hopefully that will come to an end now. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1006.06s)]
*  And I would suppose that starting on maybe not January 20, but 21, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1009.56s)]
*  a dialogue will reconnect. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1015.56s)]
*  Thank you, Marc. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1020.56s)]
*  I'd like to turn briefly, since we're on the subject of the EU, to Florence. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1022.06s)]
*  And just Florence, if you could maybe talk a little bit about how you think European nations [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1026.56s)]
*  focus on domestic politics, including COVID lockdowns and vaccine rollout, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1033.56s)]
*  how this might affect EU policy in May 2021. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1038.56s)]
*  Maybe we start there and then I have a series of follow-up questions. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1043.56s)]
*  So I think that you mentioned domestic politics. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1047.56s)]
*  I think that's a very good point, which is not just a result of our attention [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1052.06s)]
*  being very centered on what's happening in Europe. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1058.06s)]
*  I think it's also the result of the fact that, for instance, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1061.06s)]
*  migration numbers were affected by COVID. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1064.06s)]
*  So because of lockdowns everywhere in the world, pretty much migration numbers [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1067.06s)]
*  into the EU since the beginning of the pandemic have decreased by 85%. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1071.06s)]
*  So at the moment, it looks like the problem isn't actually there. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1076.06s)]
*  Now, before the pandemic, for a third of Europeans, apologies, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1080.56s)]
*  for a third of Europeans, this was the most important problem the EU was facing. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1085.56s)]
*  So climate change was the second one, but migration for a third was really the most important one. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1090.56s)]
*  So that at the moment means that the problem isn't there. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1096.56s)]
*  And terrorism, for instance, which is perhaps the second dimension, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1100.56s)]
*  is seen as not really an EU problem because it's something that happened in France, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1105.06s)]
*  it's something that happened perhaps in Austria, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1110.06s)]
*  but it's not directly linked to the Middle East [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1113.06s)]
*  because the terrorist attack in Austria was perpetrated by somebody [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1116.06s)]
*  who came from the Balkans originally. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1122.06s)]
*  Then, of course, we have France, which is seen as a French migration problem, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1124.06s)]
*  integration problem. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1129.06s)]
*  I think the perception that the problem isn't there is an illusion [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1131.56s)]
*  and it will probably make a comeback in the next year. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1135.56s)]
*  I want to say something, though, in addition to what Mark just said. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1139.56s)]
*  When you read the joint communication that the EU issued on transatlantic relations, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1143.56s)]
*  the Middle East is, of course, all over the place. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1148.56s)]
*  So you have Iran, you have Syria, you have Yemen, you have the Sahel, you have Libya. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1151.56s)]
*  To me, that looks like the Europeans together are looking to Washington [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1157.06s)]
*  to help them redefine their Middle East policy [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1163.06s)]
*  because, as Mark just said, the EU has been sidelined. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1167.06s)]
*  But the danger that I see is that we were never fully aligned with Washington [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1171.06s)]
*  on all the problems in the region. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1176.06s)]
*  So we as Europeans, Trump has triggered an important self-reflection process [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1178.06s)]
*  on strategic autonomy or sovereignty, no matter what you want to call it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1183.56s)]
*  This declaration reads a bit like, okay, maybe we don't have to do that reflection [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1186.56s)]
*  and instead we can just hope for Washington to solve all our issues. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1190.56s)]
*  Washington will not bail us out in Libya, Washington will not fix Syria, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1194.56s)]
*  Washington will not fix Yemen. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1198.56s)]
*  Perhaps we can hope for Washington to return to the GCPOA, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1201.56s)]
*  but I don't think that everything will be well in the Middle East and North Africa [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1206.56s)]
*  just after this communication. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1211.06s)]
*  Florence, if I may ask a follow-up question, having to do, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1215.06s)]
*  I know you're not an Iran expert, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1219.06s)]
*  I'm curious to hear your take on what will the EU's approach [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1221.06s)]
*  to the Iran dossier be under a Biden administration? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1225.06s)]
*  Apologies for the phone ringing, but it must be my father. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1229.06s)]
*  He's very persistent. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1232.06s)]
*  So I think the EU approach is really focusing on getting Washington back [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1234.06s)]
*  into the agreement as it was. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1240.56s)]
*  So from an European point of view, there is no need to redefine this, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1242.56s)]
*  to renegotiate it, but really just to get Washington back in. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1246.56s)]
*  And if that happens, that will be a win for the EU [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1250.56s)]
*  and a win for multilateralism more generally. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1253.56s)]
*  But I think it's really a going back to 2015 approach. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1255.56s)]
*  Marc, if you will, I would like to turn it back to you [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1262.56s)]
*  and talk a little bit about Turkey and the EU. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1265.56s)]
*  I wonder if you might tackle the question of [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1269.06s)]
*  how has the EU's relationship with Turkey developed over the past year [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1271.06s)]
*  and where is it heading? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1275.06s)]
*  I know you've written about the EU needing to take a harder line [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1277.06s)]
*  towards Erdogan, and you did mention the EU [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1280.06s)]
*  being an absent actor in the region. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1285.06s)]
*  What does the EU not procrastinating, so to speak, look like [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1291.06s)]
*  and what do you think are priority actions that the EU should take in this regard? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1295.06s)]
*  Well, I think from a European perspective, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1299.56s)]
*  you have two things happening in Turkey. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1302.56s)]
*  One is deliberate provocations by the president [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1304.56s)]
*  in the Eastern Med, but also elsewhere. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1308.56s)]
*  Terms like Nazis and fascists for Chancellor Merkel, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1312.56s)]
*  check your mental health for President Macron, etc. etc. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1316.56s)]
*  That is the president's, Turkish president's style, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1319.56s)]
*  but it simply reflects domestic politics. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1324.06s)]
*  The economy is going bad, the opinion polls are not very good [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1327.06s)]
*  for the governing alliance, therefore ramping up [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1332.06s)]
*  an Austrian ideology with the Europeans is always seen as profitable. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1336.06s)]
*  Well, that's a small thing. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1340.06s)]
*  The main thing is that what you have now is [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1342.06s)]
*  an affirmation of power by Turkey, at least in its region, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1346.06s)]
*  from Libya to the Caucasus, and together with a military build-up. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1351.06s)]
*  The military build-up was planned in the early years of the AKP in power, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1357.06s)]
*  that is 2003 onwards, and it's not showing. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1362.56s)]
*  It's not showing in a big way with armed drones, with new submarines, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1366.56s)]
*  with a helicopter carrier coming in service this year, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1371.56s)]
*  new small short-range missiles, etc. etc. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1377.06s)]
*  And that is in itself a technical and a political game changer. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1381.06s)]
*  Technical because as we've seen in Idlib province in Syria, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1388.06s)]
*  as we've seen around Tripoli of Libya, and as we've seen in Azerbaijan, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1392.06s)]
*  tactical drones from Turkey have made a difference, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1397.06s)]
*  but they also made a difference not just in military terms, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1401.06s)]
*  but also in political terms because they made Turkey a player [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1405.06s)]
*  in the politics of Libya, Syria and Azerbaijan, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1410.56s)]
*  or Azerbaijan versus Armenia if you prefer, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1415.56s)]
*  in a way that was not there a year ago. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1418.56s)]
*  So that is a massive achievement for the president of Turkey. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1421.56s)]
*  He says so, he said that about a week or two ago in one public speech, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1427.56s)]
*  and then you have to look at it in different ways in the European perspective. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1433.06s)]
*  One is that you have a theory about Turkey, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1439.06s)]
*  he's the power in the middle, cannot be satisfied anymore with its membership of NATO. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1442.56s)]
*  It has to have a balanced relationship with Russia, China, the Middle East and others. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1449.06s)]
*  That's a little too theorized, if I may say, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1455.06s)]
*  because there is a lot of domestic politics in it, of course. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1461.56s)]
*  But the main problem that we have, again from an EU perspective and a NATO perspective, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1465.56s)]
*  is that this sort of zigzagging policy in the region [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1471.56s)]
*  and the sort of challenges that are posed to the EU or to Greece, Cyprus and others, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1477.56s)]
*  but also to the US in a number of ways, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1485.56s)]
*  that warrants a very thorough assessment, probably jointly by the EU and the US, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1490.06s)]
*  because it is disruptive, of course, of NATO, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1497.06s)]
*  who is the deployment of S-400 missiles. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1501.06s)]
*  The missiles are there, they're not going to go away. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1504.06s)]
*  Suddenly Russia will not accept to take them back. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1507.06s)]
*  And that's a massive change in the European or NATO missile defense architecture for Europe. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1511.06s)]
*  And also the military build-up is not going to go away. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1518.56s)]
*  It may even be reinforced by sanctions by the US or by the EU. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1521.56s)]
*  And we see that already with when an engine or a tank is not available from Germany anymore since last year, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1526.56s)]
*  you go to South Korea to get one. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1534.56s)]
*  When you have trouble looming on jet engines or rocket engines, you turn to Ukraine, etc. etc. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1536.56s)]
*  So I think not only the Turkish defense industry is extremely performing, innovative also. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1545.06s)]
*  After all, in about a year, you'll have a high altitude long endurance arm drone, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1554.06s)]
*  something that only the US, China and Israel can build. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1562.06s)]
*  The French and the British are buying it from the US. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1566.06s)]
*  So Turkey will be there on the market and that in itself is a game changer. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1571.56s)]
*  So we'll see how things turn out with the president of Turkey, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1576.56s)]
*  but both in Washington and in Brussels we'll have, I think, a thorough review of the policy. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1583.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1594.56s)]
*  Before we start looking at China, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1595.56s)]
*  and since we're on the subject of the EU and we talked about Russia, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1600.06s)]
*  I'd like to just briefly ask Dimitri if you may tackle a question that has to do with looking at the incoming Biden administration. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1603.06s)]
*  And do you think that a Biden administration will impact EU policy towards Russia? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1612.06s)]
*  Or how do you think a Biden administration will impact EU policy towards Russia? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1618.06s)]
*  Well, I think the Biden administration is determined to mobilize the West [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1623.56s)]
*  against what President-elect Biden calls China's challenge and Russia's threat. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1629.56s)]
*  So that's a change from the situation under Donald Trump. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1637.56s)]
*  But actually, Russian-European relations have taken a plunge to the lower depths in the last few years, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1647.06s)]
*  but in particular the last few months. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1657.06s)]
*  So Europe is, I think, as skeptical or let's say adversarially disposed towards Russia as the United States is. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1660.06s)]
*  And I think that there'll be less and less daylight between the European approach to relations with Russia and the US approach. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1673.56s)]
*  So that's how it's seen. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1684.56s)]
*  I think that the pressure on Russia from the West, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1687.56s)]
*  as a result of the combined efforts of the United States and the European Union, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1691.56s)]
*  will only grow in the next four years. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1696.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1703.56s)]
*  Just turning to China, I'd like to ask Evan just a broad question as to China's strategy in the region. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1705.56s)]
*  Evan, how would you evaluate China's strategy and potential legacy in the Middle East? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1713.56s)]
*  And what do you see as being Beijing's ambitions in the Middle East moving forward? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1720.56s)]
*  And I say this, I ask this because I wonder if it's correct to observe that China's influence [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1727.06s)]
*  seems to be primarily related to economic investment, security, oil supplies and cultural promotion, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1733.06s)]
*  which to me signals a more opportunistic rather than a strategic approach in the MENA region. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1742.06s)]
*  Is this the case? Will this continue to be China's policy in the region? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1749.06s)]
*  And might China be involved more aggressively, more strategically, more fairly at some point in the region? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1754.56s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1760.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, I'm struck at how security and political centric the conversation's been in the panel so far, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1761.56s)]
*  because when you pivot to China at a macro level, obviously China's been able to steer a course [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1769.56s)]
*  that's involved developing relatively productive relations with poles of power in the region [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1775.56s)]
*  that historically have not had productive and stable relations with one another, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Israel, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1782.06s)]
*  the Emirates, Turkey, and so on. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1787.06s)]
*  And they've done that first because they've not led with their chin geopolitically, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1790.06s)]
*  but have really put economics at the center of their approach to the region. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1796.06s)]
*  But then second, because of the increasing diversification of the economic offering, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1800.06s)]
*  China, yes, has oil and gas, hydrocarbons and energy-based liquid products at the center of it. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1806.56s)]
*  But China's a trader, builder, lender, and investor. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1813.56s)]
*  And it varies the nature of that offering from country to country in ways that I think have staying power [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1818.56s)]
*  and will have some interesting legacy effects. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1826.56s)]
*  So just to pull a few of those threads for you. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1828.56s)]
*  First on diversification, both the Saudi and the Iraqi pieces on hydrocarbons obviously are significant. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1831.06s)]
*  But when I look at China's economic profile and posture in the region, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1839.06s)]
*  I see a lot more diversity than there was even five years ago. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1843.06s)]
*  One piece is the digital backbone, information and communications technologies, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1846.06s)]
*  that they're building around the region. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1851.06s)]
*  Second is construction. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1853.06s)]
*  And then a third is marrying ICT to construction by building digital networks. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1855.06s)]
*  And that comes to a second piece, which is to become a standard center. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1860.56s)]
*  Because what you find, not just in the Middle East, but around the world, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1863.56s)]
*  is that when China builds it, whether it's 5G telecom backbone by using Huawei kit [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1866.56s)]
*  or its power generation systems, they build it to a Chinese standard. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1872.56s)]
*  And so over time, they're able essentially to export their indigenous engineering standards [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1875.56s)]
*  and they become default national, regional, and then potentially global standards. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1880.56s)]
*  So that's an important legacy factor, because if you think about multinational players, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1887.06s)]
*  that at minimum creates a standards harmonization problem with the standard. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1891.06s)]
*  Or in time, a plug and play problem for other multinationals that want to come into those settings. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1895.06s)]
*  A third piece is finance. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1902.06s)]
*  And I think the financial aspect is often underweighted. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1904.06s)]
*  You have Middle Eastern funds, Gulf funds, ADIYA, Mobadala, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1907.06s)]
*  that are essentially in China looking for a yield, multibillion dollar retail portfolio, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1912.06s)]
*  for ADIYA in China. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1916.56s)]
*  You have Middle Eastern sovereign funds that have bought into bond offerings from China. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1919.56s)]
*  But then the flip, which is the flow of Chinese capital into the Middle East, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1924.56s)]
*  and frankly using Dubai and other places as dropping off points to move into Africa and other places. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1929.56s)]
*  Dubai, for example, has the potential to be an Islamic finance hub for China, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1935.56s)]
*  which wants to move into that space. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1938.56s)]
*  Then you have upskilling. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1941.56s)]
*  There are 14,000 Arab students in China. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1942.56s)]
*  So you have a generation mostly of masters and PhD students that are going to be trained, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1945.06s)]
*  which is important if you think about developmental choices. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1949.06s)]
*  And then last, I would put vaccines onto your radar. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1951.06s)]
*  They've run vaccine trials in the Emirates, for example, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1955.06s)]
*  which has very conspicuously publicly vaccinated its elite, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1958.06s)]
*  including Sheikh Maktoum, who is on television getting a Chinese Sinopharm vaccine in his arm. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1962.06s)]
*  Bahrain, Egypt, may use Chinese vaccines. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1967.06s)]
*  And my view is that will have bellwether and cascade effects across the region. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1970.56s)]
*  So I do think the picture is increasingly diversified. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1974.56s)]
*  And that's not to say that the security and diplomatic aspects aren't there, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1977.56s)]
*  but by putting economics at the center, it gives China a different kind of profile posture [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1981.56s)]
*  and potentially legacy in time that really I think will be distinctive [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1986.56s)]
*  and have an impact on the developmental agenda of the region. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1991.06s)]
*  So I can't help. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1996.56s)]
*  What you say strikes a chord because I was recently in Iraq [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=1998.06s)]
*  and I actually encountered a lot of politicians who had been vaccinated with the Chinese vaccine, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2002.06s)]
*  which is interesting in itself. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2007.06s)]
*  But I can't help but ask then, would you assess that China is looking to expand its influence [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2008.06s)]
*  diplomatically and politically outside of economically? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2015.06s)]
*  And what does that expansion look like? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2018.06s)]
*  Well, it's always been there. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2022.06s)]
*  I mean, they've been an arms sale player in the region since the 1980s. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2023.56s)]
*  And they've been a diplomatic player in the region. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2028.06s)]
*  But I think they've not seen fit to lead with their chin on it. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2030.06s)]
*  So I think I do buy the argument that people make that over time, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2034.06s)]
*  as their interests become diversified, they'll find themselves pulled more [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2039.06s)]
*  into a set of security and geopolitical questions. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2043.06s)]
*  But I think they've been a very reluctant player on that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2046.06s)]
*  And it will generally be more transactional for them. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2051.06s)]
*  But we'll see how it evolves over time. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2055.56s)]
*  But I think their strategy around the world has really been to put the economics at the center. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2057.56s)]
*  And it's exactly why they've had a much more diversified and distinctive offering for the region. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2063.56s)]
*  You also mentioned sort of China's ability to straddle sort of these relations with Saudi, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2072.56s)]
*  Iran and some others that aren't traditionally allies. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2080.56s)]
*  Do you think this balance will impact for it is into more diplomatic and political involvement? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2085.06s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2093.06s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2095.06s)]
*  I mean, they couldn't pull off that trick if they were more, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2096.06s)]
*  if they put strategy and geopolitics more at the center, it would be harder to do. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2099.06s)]
*  I think, frankly, the United States is going to sharpen that set of countries over time. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2103.06s)]
*  I think it was Demetri, it may have been Mark, who alluded to the way the United States is increasingly [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2108.56s)]
*  offshoring its own China policy. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2113.56s)]
*  American policy toward China has become increasingly securitized. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2116.56s)]
*  And so the United States looks at commercial flows, whether it's of technology or data or capital, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2120.56s)]
*  or even people increasingly refracted through a strategic prism of its own concern with China. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2126.56s)]
*  And as it securitizes its own relationship, it's essentially offshoring its China policy [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2134.06s)]
*  by using administrative and legal instruments that it has to bring pressure on third party governments [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2139.06s)]
*  and companies not to do business with China. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2144.06s)]
*  And you see this in the American pressure in the region, for example, on Egypt or on the Emirates [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2147.06s)]
*  to not use Huawei in the digital backbone. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2151.06s)]
*  That's not met with a lot of success precisely because of what I said earlier, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2155.06s)]
*  that China has been able to not depoliticize its offering, but it's not seen as a neutral, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2160.56s)]
*  but I think it's seen as a self-interested player. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2166.56s)]
*  And so what happens is that in all of those countries that you named, the demand side pull, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2169.56s)]
*  rather than the supply side push, the attraction of what China can offer to their own approaches, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2174.56s)]
*  rather than China trying to push a one size fits all model, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2179.56s)]
*  gives them a stake with China that has enabled China to straddle a little bit [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2183.56s)]
*  across countries that have been strategic rivals and have not been able to view their relationships [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2189.06s)]
*  with the EU or Russia or the United States in a similar way. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2195.06s)]
*  But that might get harder in time. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2200.06s)]
*  Yes, and comments are starting to come in, so I'll start integrating them in the discussion as they fit. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2204.06s)]
*  In particular, there's one that's relevant at this juncture that is to you, Evan, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2209.06s)]
*  how might Chinese policy change in the region, specifically as the US becomes more of an introvert in the Middle East? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2215.56s)]
*  Well, I think it's, I mean, it's clearly already changed in the hydrocarbon space [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2224.56s)]
*  because as the US has receded as a demand driver and China has increased as a demand driver, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2228.56s)]
*  it's obviously become very significant, not just as an oil purchaser for a country like Iraq, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2234.56s)]
*  but as a gas purchaser for a country like Qatar also. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2239.56s)]
*  So I think in the hydrocarbon space, the lure of the China market, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2243.06s)]
*  but also the dependence on Chinese refiners and on Chinese state oil companies [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2250.06s)]
*  and energy companies is going to continue to increase. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2255.06s)]
*  I think for Middle Eastern governments that want to diversify their development model [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2259.06s)]
*  and their economic posture over time, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2265.06s)]
*  China presents some attractions, not just in a tactical sense because of the capital that can flow in, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2268.56s)]
*  but frankly, I've noticed this in other regions around the world. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2274.56s)]
*  Authoritarian developmentalism, which is essentially China's model, is attractive, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2277.56s)]
*  and it's attractive not because other countries can necessarily replicate China. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2282.56s)]
*  There's no place in the world that's really like China, that has a Leninist ruling party, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2287.56s)]
*  a heavily state-backed economy in the way that state-owned enterprises function in China, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2291.56s)]
*  but the way China's been able to get productivity gains, the way it's able to develop a manufacturing base, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2297.06s)]
*  the way it's skilled its population and created an export sector, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2302.06s)]
*  I think there are governments around the region that will find that attractive. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2307.06s)]
*  And the United States, it's not a developing country. It hasn't been a developing country. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2310.06s)]
*  In fact, you wouldn't really refer to the United States that way historically. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2315.06s)]
*  So I think as China pushes various elements of its model developmentally around the region, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2319.06s)]
*  I think it's a good example of China's role as well, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2325.56s)]
*  that the United States really hasn't been in that space and will therefore, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2328.56s)]
*  there's nothing to recede from, but is part of the kind of legacy that China's constructing in the region. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2332.56s)]
*  It's why countries are looking to Beijing in a very diverse and different way [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2337.56s)]
*  than they've looked to the United States in the past. I hope that makes sense. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2342.56s)]
*  A question, I mean, Evan, this relates to you, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2349.56s)]
*  from a US-UK perspective, I'm interested also in the nexus of external powers [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2353.06s)]
*  and their involvement in the MENA region. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2358.06s)]
*  And the question of China, China has taken a backseat to Russia in certain hotspots, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2360.06s)]
*  Syria in particular, and they've largely been on the same page regarding Iran. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2366.06s)]
*  But what's the likelihood, I mean, I guess from each of your perspectives, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2372.06s)]
*  of growing friction between the two around areas where interests might diverge? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2376.06s)]
*  Especially as China's relative economic heft in the region and demand for energy grows. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2382.56s)]
*  I don't know, Dimitri, just to give Evan a break, maybe you want to jump in [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2388.56s)]
*  and then maybe Evan, provide your own perspective. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2391.56s)]
*  Okay, well, thank you, Patricia. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2395.56s)]
*  The Sino-Russian relationship is based on a formula [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2399.56s)]
*  that essentially commands that the two countries are never against each other, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2405.06s)]
*  but that they do not always have to be with each other. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2414.06s)]
*  The beauty of that formula is that it also, it creates two things. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2421.06s)]
*  It creates a flexible partnership between Beijing and Moscow, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2426.06s)]
*  and it allows the two countries to manage the areas where they have differences. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2432.56s)]
*  A lot of people looking not just at the Middle East, but primarily at Central Asia, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2439.56s)]
*  have been expecting China and Russia to collide. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2444.56s)]
*  They have been expecting the two countries to enter into a conflict with each other [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2448.56s)]
*  for about 30 years, at least 25 years, but the wait continues. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2454.56s)]
*  China and Russia have managed not to work against each other. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2462.56s)]
*  I think that the Middle East offers another example where China and Russia [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2469.56s)]
*  have found ways to steer clear of each other. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2474.56s)]
*  China does, as Evan very eloquently described, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2477.56s)]
*  China is essentially involved in economics and finance and infrastructure [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2480.56s)]
*  and all these economic things. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2486.56s)]
*  Russia is essentially a geopolitical actor, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2490.06s)]
*  as a player of arms and equipment. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2494.06s)]
*  There, China and Russia may be, and actually they are competitors, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2499.06s)]
*  but that's essentially a fairly light competition. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2503.06s)]
*  I wouldn't expect China and Russia to undermine each other's positions in the Middle East. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2509.06s)]
*  China is actually finding it useful. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2515.56s)]
*  Russia, due to its character, steps forward. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2518.56s)]
*  Russia is an in-your-face country. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2522.56s)]
*  It steps forward. It's not afraid of a good fight. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2524.56s)]
*  China often takes a back seat, hides behind Russia, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2529.56s)]
*  and actually benefits from that division of labor. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2533.56s)]
*  So I wouldn't expect China and Russia to come to blows [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2544.06s)]
*  or even to enter a serious conflict, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2547.06s)]
*  or even friction, substantial friction in the Middle East. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2552.06s)]
*  I'm going to sneak in a question since Evan, sorry, Evan, do you want to respond? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2561.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2566.06s)]
*  You know, Dmitry said something interesting. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2567.06s)]
*  He said China will often avoid a fight. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2569.06s)]
*  I think actually China increasingly is willing to fight, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2571.56s)]
*  but Russia is not one of the parties they're particularly interested in fighting with. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2574.56s)]
*  What they have in common, as Dmitry implied, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2577.56s)]
*  is that both countries are deeply ambivalent about American foreign policy [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2580.56s)]
*  and about American power. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2585.56s)]
*  And so in this part of the world, as in other parts of the world, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2587.56s)]
*  they have no reason to necessarily be across purposes [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2589.56s)]
*  because they share both a strategic interest and an ambivalence [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2592.56s)]
*  about the direction of American policy and American relationships. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2596.56s)]
*  That's what they share. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2600.06s)]
*  What they don't share is essentially the nature of the offering. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2601.06s)]
*  And also, as Dmitry was implying, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2604.06s)]
*  Russia simply doesn't offer in Central Asia, in the Middle East, in North Africa, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2606.06s)]
*  really anywhere what China offers, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2610.06s)]
*  which is large-scale state-backed infrastructure, finance, and capital. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2611.56s)]
*  It doesn't have the same role as a demand driver. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2616.06s)]
*  You just take a place like Iraq. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2618.06s)]
*  I think Iraq now buys about, sells about half its oil production to China. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2620.06s)]
*  You know, and frankly, China is a customer for Russian hydrocarbon products as well. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2625.06s)]
*  So I don't see the region as really a locus of friction between those two. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2629.56s)]
*  And as Dmitry implied when he mentioned Central Asia, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2636.56s)]
*  there's a region where we've been hearing for years [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2638.56s)]
*  that you'd see the emergence of friction. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2641.56s)]
*  Russia has much more at stake given its historical relationships, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2643.56s)]
*  its political relationships in that region, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2646.56s)]
*  but we just haven't seen it emerge. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2648.56s)]
*  And so I would be very skeptical that it would emerge in this region as well. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2650.56s)]
*  I think they find each other quite useful. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2653.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2656.56s)]
*  Like I said, I was going to sneak a question to Dmitry [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2658.06s)]
*  before turning to Florence and Mark. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2661.06s)]
*  The question comes from the audience. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2664.06s)]
*  Will any U.S. cold shoulder to Saudi Arabia [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2667.06s)]
*  help Russia edge closer to this important Gulf power? [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2670.06s)]
*  Well, one of the products of Russia's involvement in Syria [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2676.06s)]
*  has been a closer interaction with Saudi Arabia. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2682.06s)]
*  And the last several years have seen much more interaction [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2688.06s)]
*  between Moscow and Riyadh on the issue of oil price. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2693.06s)]
*  Of Russia as a country that has joined the OPEC plus, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2699.06s)]
*  has emerged as very much a partner or counterpart for Saudi Arabia [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2707.56s)]
*  in that framework. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2713.56s)]
*  Russia and Saudi Arabia have been supporting different sides [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2716.56s)]
*  in the Syrian civil war, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2721.56s)]
*  but since both countries are essentially led by pragmatic leaders, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2723.56s)]
*  they've been able to engage in some kind of a host rating, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2734.06s)]
*  some kind of, I wouldn't call it cooperation, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2739.06s)]
*  but some kind of interaction that allowed both of them [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2743.06s)]
*  to have, to benefit from what may emerge in Syria post-? [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2747.06s)]
*  It's also interesting that in some other places in the Middle East, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2754.06s)]
*  Russia and Saudi Arabia are actually very much on the same page. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2758.56s)]
*  Egypt has become again, for example, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2766.56s)]
*  Egypt has become again a buyer of Russian military equipment and weapons. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2769.56s)]
*  Egypt doesn't have the money to pay Russia, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2775.56s)]
*  so the money comes from Saudi Arabia. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2778.56s)]
*  In Libya, Russia has been acting in very close cooperation with Egypt, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2782.06s)]
*  but also with the Emirates and to a degree with the Saudis. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2794.06s)]
*  So it's a web of interest in Russia and Saudi Arabia [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2798.06s)]
*  over the past several years. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2804.06s)]
*  I've found not only areas where they compete [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2806.06s)]
*  or where they can have a conflict, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2810.56s)]
*  but also areas where they can find each other useful [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2813.56s)]
*  and collaborate to mutual benefit. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2817.56s)]
*  Thank you, Dimitri. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2823.56s)]
*  I'd like to briefly turn to Florence [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2825.56s)]
*  and ask just a question about the US and the EU [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2827.56s)]
*  and what have been the US and or the EU responses [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2832.56s)]
*  to China and Russia influence tactics in the region [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2838.06s)]
*  and challenges to US or EU interests, if you prefer. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2841.06s)]
*  And how do you think we should be approaching the challenges differently? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2846.06s)]
*  So the problem is obviously that we don't have an answer really, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2853.06s)]
*  because when it comes to, well, you just mentioned influence tactics, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2857.06s)]
*  but it's basically both China and Russia deploy tools [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2861.06s)]
*  that the EU doesn't master like they do. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2865.56s)]
*  So when it comes to military force that Russia uses, [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2868.56s)]
*  Europeans are obviously reluctant to do that. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2872.56s)]
*  When it comes to disinformation, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2875.56s)]
*  we are barely putting together a response. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2878.56s)]
*  And when it comes to unconditional or rather unpolitical [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2881.56s)]
*  financial and economic cooperation, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2886.56s)]
*  here clearly China has an advantage that the EU doesn't have. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2889.56s)]
*  So in other words, the standard model of European approach to the region [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2893.06s)]
*  is being outflanked on the left by Russia and on the right by China. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2899.06s)]
*  So in the old days, you know, pre-Arab Spring or pre 2014, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2904.06s)]
*  Europe would have been able to, at least with a non-goth producing state, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2909.06s)]
*  to have more leverage because of economic cooperation. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2914.06s)]
*  And so it's still actually as a transformational power, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2919.56s)]
*  you know, the creation of a ring of friends and so forth. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2923.56s)]
*  And now I think the buyers of that model are increasingly rare. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2926.56s)]
*  So I think the honest answer to this question is [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2931.56s)]
*  that the EU is still doing the homework. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2935.56s)]
*  I see the EU when it comes to its foreign policy in the region, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2938.56s)]
*  but probably in foreign policy in general, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2941.56s)]
*  in a deep reflection process. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2943.56s)]
*  So you see that, of course, in this debate on autonomy, sovereignty [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2945.56s)]
*  and strategic compass, etc. etc. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2948.56s)]
*  And a lot of what the HRBP says, you know, the language of power, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2950.56s)]
*  all of these things are still ongoing and we're still learning. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2954.56s)]
*  But the fact is that at the moment we are, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2958.56s)]
*  if you're going to compare it to a football game, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2961.06s)]
*  we are on the bench and thinking about what we should do next [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2963.06s)]
*  and how our interests could be met, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2966.06s)]
*  because at the moment they are not being met. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2969.06s)]
*  But I might add that this is a notorious problem that the EU has [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2972.06s)]
*  because in the region, a region of conflict and tension [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2975.06s)]
*  where the rules are upended, the EU is the one constantly reminding [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2979.56s)]
*  everybody of what the rules are or what they're supposed to be. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2983.56s)]
*  So how do you win a game in which you're the only one [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2986.56s)]
*  reminding everybody of the rules and sticking to the rules, but nobody else? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2990.06s)]
*  Just to jump in, there's a relevant question from the audience to you, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2993.56s)]
*  which I will direct to you, Florence, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=2998.56s)]
*  which is honestly the EU looks more and more irrelevant in the region. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3001.06s)]
*  Even in the Mediterranean, look at Libya and Lebanon, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3005.06s)]
*  is France acting out of frustration from the EU? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3008.06s)]
*  I think this is an honest question and I think it's absolutely candid to say [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3013.06s)]
*  that at the moment the EU is not the most important player [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3019.06s)]
*  because we are not a security player, because we are not acting [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3023.06s)]
*  in all these ways that the others are doing. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3027.06s)]
*  We're also not as ruthless as others. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3029.56s)]
*  So we might be the good guys in the story, but at the end we don't win the girls. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3031.56s)]
*  So I think I agree that we are, as I said, on the bench and reflecting at the moment. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3035.56s)]
*  I think that the member states, you know, France of course being a case in point, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3041.56s)]
*  certainly do act where they feel that the EU as a collective is not acting enough. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3047.56s)]
*  This is of course always this EU problem, you know, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3052.56s)]
*  the member state was the collective level, individual member states feeling [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3057.06s)]
*  that their interests aren't being met, that they don't get what they need. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3060.06s)]
*  But I think in this particular case, because you mentioned France, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3064.06s)]
*  it goes a little bit further because I think for France it's about more than [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3068.06s)]
*  terrorism, Islamism, what have you. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3072.06s)]
*  I think for France there's also a geopolitical power play in the cards, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3074.06s)]
*  specifically when it comes to Turkey. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3080.06s)]
*  So the whole reception of President Sisi, etc. has to be seen, I think, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3082.56s)]
*  primarily in this slide. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3087.56s)]
*  And of course, you know, France, if you want, is at a different level in terms of [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3088.56s)]
*  geopolitical reflection of its own role in the region than other member states are. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3093.56s)]
*  I'm not saying, you know, further advance or behind, but it's just a different level. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3098.56s)]
*  And I think that becomes indeed very apparent in its own actions that in many ways [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3102.56s)]
*  the EU is deviating from what the consensus in the EU is when it comes to the region. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3108.06s)]
*  Thank you, Florence. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3115.06s)]
*  Turning to Mark briefly, I have two questions which are sort of linked, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3117.06s)]
*  one that comes from the audience. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3121.06s)]
*  I'll read it out. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3123.06s)]
*  Considering China's active economic presence and Russia's geopolitical [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3125.06s)]
*  intervention in the region, what could be an alternative for the EU to offer [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3129.06s)]
*  so as to enhance its image as a partner? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3134.06s)]
*  A quick follow up to what Florence just said. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3138.06s)]
*  Historically, the EU is a post-war project, you know, never again. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3142.06s)]
*  After 75 years of French-German wars, two of them world wars. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3147.06s)]
*  And basically, the EU has been an exporter of values. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3153.06s)]
*  Never again a conflict between the two countries. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3158.06s)]
*  The EU has been an exporter of values. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3162.56s)]
*  Never again a conflict between ourselves, the Europeans, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3165.56s)]
*  and we'll export this model to the outside world. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3169.56s)]
*  Except that in the past five years, ten years, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3173.56s)]
*  we have been witnessing a rise of the authoritarian model. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3177.56s)]
*  And when you look at a country like Turkey, well, because of their geographical position, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3182.56s)]
*  because of the unresolved conflicts around them, Cyprus, maritime boundaries, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3191.56s)]
*  Caucasus, and so on, and because of domestic political constraints, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3197.56s)]
*  essentially, the Russian model looks more attractive than the European model. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3203.56s)]
*  The, what I call the Crimea methodology is what Turkey is doing. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3209.56s)]
*  You have an objective, you know it's not legal, you know you're going to be criticized, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3215.56s)]
*  you're going to be sanctioned, but you move very quickly and you set foot, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3221.06s)]
*  you create realities on the ground, and then you sort of transform these military realities [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3225.56s)]
*  into a political reality, which is what is happening around Turkey. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3232.06s)]
*  That is not the model of governance that EU member states follow. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3240.06s)]
*  Secondly, you have what we call the French-German engine within the EU, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3246.06s)]
*  rather natural because these are the biggest two countries, but you have different traditions. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3253.06s)]
*  Germany is still digesting its World War II complex, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3259.06s)]
*  still very reluctant to build a big army, extremely reluctant to have foreign operations, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3264.06s)]
*  military operations, and France is still operating on the Charles de Gaulle methodology. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3270.06s)]
*  We are Europeans and we're going to tell you, you other Europeans, how to do it. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3277.06s)]
*  And that essentially doesn't work today because you have 27 member states, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3282.06s)]
*  and then you don't have 26 member states that are going to follow a French leap. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3289.06s)]
*  So it may be frustrating in both Berlin and Paris for different reasons, but it just doesn't work. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3295.06s)]
*  Then turning to the question about the CPOA, I don't think a return to the nuclear agreement [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3303.06s)]
*  will change drastically the Russian attitude in Syria. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3312.06s)]
*  What will matter there is whether because you'd have the US administration [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3318.06s)]
*  returning to genuine multilateralism and in conjunction with the EU, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3325.06s)]
*  maybe Russia will pay attention and will be willing in order to close this Syrian nightmare, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3333.06s)]
*  which is rather costly, will turn to a UN led process. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3343.06s)]
*  And to some extent, different circumstances, you can think of the same thing in Libya. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3350.06s)]
*  If the US, she's diplomatically active in Libya, and the special coordinator from the UN is a US diplomat, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3356.06s)]
*  second to the UN, if the EU wants to play a role, maybe we will come to some sort of progress. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3367.06s)]
*  So I think a lot of what we have in front of us hinges upon a greater willingness of European states, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3375.06s)]
*  heads of states and government to act together and to get up between themselves and with the US. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3386.06s)]
*  Thank you. Given that we only have a few minutes left, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3397.06s)]
*  what I'd like to do is begin to wrap by asking one final question to the panelists. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3401.06s)]
*  We'll borrow from Kim Rattas from the previous panel by asking the question of [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3408.06s)]
*  how much does MENA matter to each of these external powers? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3415.06s)]
*  And perhaps we can start with Marc and then go through counterclockwise with all the panelists. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3419.06s)]
*  Well, Mediterranean and Middle East matters enormously to the EU because of historical reasons, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3427.06s)]
*  because of economic reasons, because of energy reasons, because of migration. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3435.06s)]
*  And also, in a way, at least for some EU countries, cultural and educational reasons. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3440.06s)]
*  So the influence is there. When it goes back, like the Syrian war and the migration crisis in 2015, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3449.06s)]
*  we can see a massive, massive, really massive consequence for the EU, to the point that, remember, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3457.06s)]
*  Chancellor Merkel said initially, that is in September 2015, that she will welcome Syrian refugees to Germany. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3465.06s)]
*  And then for the following four years, she kept losing elections because of that, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3474.06s)]
*  regional elections, London. So it has been a transformative. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3479.06s)]
*  What happened in the Mediterranean and Middle East in the past five years has been the transformative factor [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3485.06s)]
*  of politics in not only Germany, but also look at Hungary, Austria, countries that have taken [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3492.06s)]
*  an extremely negative view of migration, preventing an EU migration and asylum policy to take shape. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3500.06s)]
*  So the consequences are there. Problem is, when do they get their act together? I mean EU leaders. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3509.06s)]
*  Florence? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3520.06s)]
*  Yes, I think you have to never forget that ultimately Europe moved from being a continent to being a political project. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3522.06s)]
*  So I think this geographic component really is part of its DNA. And so it looks at the world through these geographic glasses. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3532.06s)]
*  And so the Eastern and the Southern neighborhood, I mean, the term is EU lingo, but it's not chosen by Quintin, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3539.06s)]
*  but it delineates the circles of importance in EU foreign policy. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3545.06s)]
*  The Southern and the East are the most important ones. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3550.06s)]
*  Now, unfortunately, as Mark just said, the level of importance is not reflected necessarily in the type of engagement that you would like at the moment. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3553.06s)]
*  So your question was, how important is it? Extremely important. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3561.06s)]
*  But do we master the new approach that is necessary to be of importance? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3565.06s)]
*  I think we're not there yet, but I do hope that we're getting there because I feel that there is a tectonic shift happening, but, you know, at slow European speed. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3571.06s)]
*  So perhaps not in 2021, but hopefully in the years after we will see a more muscular approach to step up our own interests and build constructive relations. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3579.06s)]
*  And Dimitri? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3589.06s)]
*  Well, the Middle East is fairly close geographically to Russia, about a thousand kilometers south of the Russian border. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3591.06s)]
*  The Middle East is the region where Russia has to deal with two important regional powers, Turkey and Iran. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3599.06s)]
*  And that has a very significant impact on Russia's foreign policy south of Moscow. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3609.06s)]
*  The Middle East is a predominantly Muslim region and Islam is the second largest and fastest growing religion inside Russia. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3617.06s)]
*  It's an area of significant non-Western financial resources, primarily in the Gulf. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3626.06s)]
*  It's an area that specializes economically in oil and gas, precisely in the Gulf. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3634.06s)]
*  It's very important that Russia and the countries in the region, primarily Saudi Arabia, but not only, are in sync about these things. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3642.06s)]
*  It's also a region that is home to a large Russian speaking diaspora in Israel. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3650.06s)]
*  And there's a unique connection, unique connection between Russia and the Gulf. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3658.06s)]
*  And very lastly, Russia historically made a huge investment in the region, primarily in countries like Egypt and Syria and Algeria and a few others. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3666.06s)]
*  Something that's not for everyone, but for the whole world. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3674.06s)]
*  And Russia has a very strong relationship with the Gulf. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3682.06s)]
*  And Russia historically made a huge investment in the region, primarily in countries like Egypt and Syria and Algeria and a few others. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3688.06s)]
*  Something that's not forgotten by policymakers in Moscow. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3694.06s)]
*  Thank you, Dimitri. Evan, last but not least. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3700.06s)]
*  Sure. Well, as with most things with China and the world, it's important not to overgeneralize, but to break it down. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3704.06s)]
*  I think you can break it down into strategic, economic and aspirational components. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3710.06s)]
*  So, basically, my view is it's not a high priority. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3716.06s)]
*  It's distantly behind domestic security and stability, which is China's number one priority. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3722.06s)]
*  Security in the East Asian littoral, security on China's Asian periphery, its Central Asian and South Asian borders. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3728.06s)]
*  And then down around fourth place, you begin to get into other regions of the world. So it's not a high priority. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3734.06s)]
*  But then it grows when you then begin to link it to the economics. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3740.06s)]
*  I think it's important to note that China is making the investments in the Middle East. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3744.06s)]
*  It's not nearly as important to China as it is to some of its neighbors. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3748.06s)]
*  Japan gets 90 percent of its oil from the Middle East and South Korea gets 85 percent. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3752.06s)]
*  So it's important, but it's not as important as it is to some others. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3756.06s)]
*  I think what's interesting about the economic profile is that it's of growing importance for logistics and for finance. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3760.06s)]
*  Logistically, the reason China is making the investments in Dubai is because it is central strategically to what China is trying to do. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3766.06s)]
*  Including Europe, by the way, as well as Africa and other parts of the world. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3773.06s)]
*  Aspirationally, and this is the last point, it is a test of the kind of power China wants to be in the world. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3777.06s)]
*  Leveraging economics for strategic effect, using capital flows, things like the Belt and Road to try to increase its profile. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3783.06s)]
*  And the Middle East in many ways is ground zero for that because China has been relatively successful with what is essentially a value-free foreign policy. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3790.06s)]
*  Leveraging economic tools for countries that have a demand side pull for what China is offering. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3797.06s)]
*  So five years from now, we'll see how they've done. But it's an interesting test of China's aspirations. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3801.06s)]
*  Thank you. I'd like to take the opportunity to now thank you all for your time. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3805.06s)]
*  Thank you, Karin, for hosting this panel. And hopefully we will do this again in person next year. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3810.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3815.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3816.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8n8pnwy0iE&t=3818.06s)]
