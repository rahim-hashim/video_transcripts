# Yemen's Catastrophe: What Can Be Done to Stop the War?
**Carnegie Endowment - Middle East:** [September 08, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ)
*  Good morning, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4.68s)]
*  I'm Fred Wary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5.68s)]
*  I'm a senior fellow at the Middle East program here at the Carnegie Endowment for International [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=6.68s)]
*  Peace. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=10.28s)]
*  It's my pleasure to welcome you to this panel on Yemen's catastrophe, what can be done to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=11.28s)]
*  stop the war. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=17.04s)]
*  Those of you who follow Yemen may have attended an event that we held roughly one year ago [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  entitled the Yemen War. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=24.04s)]
*  Is there an end in sight? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=26.18s)]
*  Of course, the answer to that question has been a tragic no. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=27.98s)]
*  The conflict in the Arab world's poorest country has entered its third year and shows no sign [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=31.7s)]
*  of abating. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=36.14s)]
*  The suffering inflicted by this war has become even more catastrophic with the United Nations [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=37.86s)]
*  calling it the world's worst humanitarian crisis. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=42.18s)]
*  And the horrific details of that war, I think, are well known to all of us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=46.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, the local and regional complexities of the conflict, I think, have multiplied [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=50.82s)]
*  further confounding a resolution, whether it's the spread of AQAP, the fracturing of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=56.279999999999994s)]
*  the Salah Houthi alliance, the Emirati-Saudi rift with Qatar, which is reverberating across [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=61.48s)]
*  the region. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=67.52s)]
*  And our panel today will take stock of these emerging developments among local and regional [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=68.52s)]
*  players with a view toward understanding what can be done to end the conflict, restore governance, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=74.28s)]
*  services, and relief. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=79.88s)]
*  It's a tall order. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=80.88s)]
*  But because the US itself is party to the conflict as well, we want to consider the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=83.34s)]
*  impact of US policies. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=88.14s)]
*  And when our last panel convened, this was before the presidential elections, so I've [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=90.53999999999999s)]
*  asked our panelists to assess what has or has not changed under the new administration [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=95.16s)]
*  toward Yemen. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=100.9s)]
*  I'm delighted to briefly introduce our panelists. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=103.7s)]
*  They need no introduction to most of you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=106.86s)]
*  Farah al-Muslimi is a nonresident fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=109.46s)]
*  the Middle East program, with a wealth of insight and first-hand expertise into the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=114.46s)]
*  country of his birth. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  He's just returned from a trip to Yemen, and if you've not seen it, I would recommend [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=120.46s)]
*  the video interview of that visit on Carnegie's Dewan blog site. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  Also joining us is Nadhwa al-Dassuri, another top analyst from Yemen with particular expertise [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=130.98s)]
*  in the country's tribes and civil society. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=136.9s)]
*  A nonresident senior fellow at the Project Our Middle East Democracy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=139.9s)]
*  She's written a lot on the spread of AQAP and also local and regional peace initiatives. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=143.66s)]
*  Finally, I'm delighted to welcome Ambassador Gerald Feierstein, currently the director [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=148.89999999999998s)]
*  for Gulf Affairs and Government Relations at the Middle East Institute, who of course [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=154.5s)]
*  served as the US ambassador to Yemen during a really pivotal time, 2010 to 2013, and then [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=158.85999999999999s)]
*  was closely involved in the country as the principal deputy assistant secretary of state [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=165.01999999999998s)]
*  for Near Eastern Affairs. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=168.94s)]
*  I think we've worked out a pretty good division of labor among our speakers. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=171.38s)]
*  We've worked out a good order, I think, too, focusing first on regional developments, sort [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  of an on-the-ground perspective on Yemen, then the role of tribes and AQAP, and finally [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=181.14s)]
*  shifting back to the impact of the international community, the regional actors, and the US. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=186.26s)]
*  We've asked each of our speakers to speak for 10 minutes, to be both analytical but [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  prescriptive, certainly not an easy task. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=197.5s)]
*  Farah, we'll start out with you with perhaps some insights from your recent trip. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=200.06s)]
*  I was struck by something you said in our last panel, that short wars change regimes, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=207.06s)]
*  long wars change societies. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=213.62s)]
*  And so what's happening on the ground based on your visit? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=215.85999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  Good morning, and thank you very much, and thanks, everyone. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=220.98000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's good to have a stop-by at Carnegie. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=223.58s)]
*  Almost here now we do it, last time with Ambassador Bruden. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=226.18s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I'm happy to share some thoughts from my trip into Yemen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=231.74s)]
*  But I must warn you, if you're looking for something smart or optimistic, you might have [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=235.58s)]
*  to wait to the next two speakers. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=240.66000000000003s)]
*  I actually was not an intern a long time ago, and I never had the chance to look at satellite [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  images, so my knowledge of Yemen is very limited compared to the two speakers around. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=248.29999999999998s)]
*  And so is there an end in what can be done? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  A lot, I think. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=258.34s)]
*  But is, you know, am I optimistic? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  Of course, no. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=263.58s)]
*  Yemen, I traveled around and this was no more the country I know, or this was no more the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=266.14s)]
*  country I grew up in. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  And this is the one thing different in Yemen right now is this is a mass, the scale war [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=272.82s)]
*  that we have never seen in our lives. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=277.22s)]
*  We have had always some sort of conflict, some sort of violence, some sort of something, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=279.74s)]
*  but never this wide scale or never this huge. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=283.58s)]
*  That's because, yes, when there is some areas where there is no war, but there is more of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=288.14s)]
*  an economic destruction that had left most harm, specifically on the north, more than [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=292.06s)]
*  the war itself. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=298.1s)]
*  Specifically the case of no salaries for nine months, specifically the economic, the economic [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=300.34000000000003s)]
*  see internally and externally has left more or less a shattered country, a country where [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=305.02s)]
*  there is no money you can make or there is no job you can make except if you are in a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=310.46s)]
*  front lines fighting as that's right now the last big job in Yemen. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=314.26s)]
*  Speaking on more details, there are right now at least three Yemen's emerging in Yemen [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=319.1s)]
*  right now. There is one in Sana'a that's the Houthi Saleh under the control of the Houthi [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=325.58s)]
*  Saleh and they basically have their own customs, their own borders, their own military, their [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=330.94s)]
*  own system and that's one part of the country. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=335.34000000000003s)]
*  And then there is second Yemen or second station of power or center of power and that's Aden [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=339.58s)]
*  and it's not really under anyone's control. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=346.7s)]
*  Theoretically it's under the control of the legitimate government but it has a long dispute [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=349.3s)]
*  between the southern Iraq, the president forces and some different fractions of armed groups [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=354.98s)]
*  that developed after the war. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=360.90000000000003s)]
*  And the third station in Yemen or the third Yemen that's right now there emerging is in [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=363.66s)]
*  Marib which is basically a combination of Islamists, a combination of the national army [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  and the combination of basically every Northenan who is not with the Houthis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=374.14s)]
*  Marib in a lot of ways right now is the last geography that represents the Republic of [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=379.14s)]
*  Yemen where you can be there despite where you are from around the country. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=384.22s)]
*  That being said these three stations of powers barely talk to each other anymore or barely [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  have some sort of something combined with them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=396.3s)]
*  Specifically since the removal of the central bank which was an unthoughtful decision that [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=399.1s)]
*  ended up cutting the last line that really keeping this place together. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=403.06s)]
*  Important I think from the U.S. point of view there is a lot that can be done in that sense [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=409.42s)]
*  and that's basically because the U.S. is a direct active in this war or a direct actor [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=414.46s)]
*  in this war but beyond that the U.S. has something that no one else can do or can change and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=421.18s)]
*  I think that's a seat at the UN Security Council that would allow the ability to do a new resolution [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=427.34s)]
*  that basically would commit to peace in Yemen. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=433.42s)]
*  2216 maybe made sense by that time but it's a resolution that commits into war that's [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=435.46s)]
*  not a resolution commits into peace. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=442.06s)]
*  That would be one thing that the United States is going to start doing let alone that the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=443.7s)]
*  legacy of unaccountability that has a thrift in Yemen and the U.S. has been part of it. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=449.14s)]
*  We hear a lot of complaints very legitimately against the funeral bombings the weddings [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=453.66s)]
*  bombings in Yemen which has been a common phenomena but as a matter of fact this is [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=457.98s)]
*  a legacy the Saudis are only reading from America's playbook. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=462.82s)]
*  In the past the United States have bombed funerals in Yemen in the past the United States [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=467.1s)]
*  have bombed weddings in Yemen and the Saudis came after them and actually in fact even [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=470.66s)]
*  Al-Qaeda has bombed weddings in Yemen in the past and in those. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=474.98s)]
*  So that legacy of unaccountability that legacy of destruction can be stopped and that's something [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=478.66s)]
*  I think that we can do from Washington D.C. in the way it goes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=483.18s)]
*  Now depending on which side you take in Yemen if you are a Houthi you will say the war started [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=490.62s)]
*  in March 25th 2015 if you are someone with the other side you will say the war started [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=497.18s)]
*  in September 21st but I think if you're someone with a brain you would have a different timeline. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=505.06s)]
*  That will go back along to 2011 where we had something very problematic led to this war [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=512.74s)]
*  in Yemen and that was the unconditional immunity that was brought by the international community [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=518.26s)]
*  and that was brought by the Gulf in Yemen. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=524.18s)]
*  This was a dangerous act because it set the ground for doing whatever you want and it [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=527.7399999999999s)]
*  set the ground for unaccountability in a country like Yemen where something where everyone [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=533.3399999999999s)]
*  has a gun and that's a very dangerous trend to start in the country. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=537.8199999999999s)]
*  By that time however the Gulf was part of the solution in Yemen right now it's part [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=541.8599999999999s)]
*  of the problem and that is a very probably the most unfortunate thing happening right [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=547.42s)]
*  now between Yemen and the Gulf. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=552.3399999999999s)]
*  In 2011 and probably Ambassador Palestine can speak more about this but the Gulf was [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=554.8199999999999s)]
*  an honorary sponsor of the GCC deal and it was able to have that ownership because it [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=559.5s)]
*  wasn't part of the problem. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=565.3s)]
*  Right now it's a big part of the problem and that's what you lose when you decide to go [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=567.02s)]
*  into a war you decide to become part of the problem even if you didn't have to and that's [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=571.8599999999999s)]
*  the big thing we're really losing. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=576.3s)]
*  Now I'll end with this thought right now beyond the three centers in Yemen beyond the regional [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=578.46s)]
*  dynamics beyond the regional fights happening in Yemen there is a moment of a fracture. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=582.62s)]
*  Everything is being fractured specifically two years after the war this honeymoon is [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=587.74s)]
*  over. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=592.14s)]
*  It's over first between the Gulf themselves who were in Yemen for completely different [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=593.5s)]
*  reasons. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=597.9s)]
*  We have seen this very clear so far on the Qatar crisis with the Gulf sidelining one [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=598.9s)]
*  country but we will see soon also between Saudi and UAE it's a matter of time. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=604.5s)]
*  They will also ultimately have to struggle for and they are already do not officially [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=609.5400000000001s)]
*  have to struggle for some space and we see it also within the Yemeni sides. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=614.22s)]
*  So the honeymoon between the president and the southern movement is over between the [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=618.86s)]
*  Islamists and their allies is over and most recently between Saleh and the Houthis is [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=623.86s)]
*  over and that's the last dynamic happening right now in the ground. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=629.3000000000001s)]
*  So it's a moment of a fracture a moment of a fragmentation and the moment where everyone [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=634.82s)]
*  is part of the problem unfortunately whether it be the Gulf or let it be the United States [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=639.22s)]
*  of America. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  I'll come back if you want later on to anything. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=646.0600000000001s)]
*  Great so Nardwa if you could kind of take that view and drill down onto the role of [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=649.3000000000001s)]
*  tribes and AQAP. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=654.9s)]
*  I'm going to second everything that Farah has said and one of the big believers that [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=656.5799999999999s)]
*  if the GCC has not been signed in the first place we wouldn't have ended. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=661.38s)]
*  So GCC was problematic and I'm sorry I'm not going to bring any less oblique picture [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=667.62s)]
*  of Yemen than you did Farah I'm also not very optimistic. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=673.14s)]
*  I'm going to talk about tribes and AQAP and it's such a complex topic. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=677.26s)]
*  I'm going to talk just about the dynamics of the relationships and how relationship [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=685.6999999999999s)]
*  between tribes and AQAP and how it works just to help you understand why tribes how tribes [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=689.8599999999999s)]
*  interact with the militant group and how they respond to threats in different ways. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=697.9399999999999s)]
*  So before I dig into the issue of tribes and AQAP I want to first of all highlight a few [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=705.58s)]
*  things about the tribes just to help you understand how the tribes function. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=717.1s)]
*  The tribes are not solid units with command and control. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=723.0600000000001s)]
*  Tribal leaders have some influence on tribesmen on their tribes but they cannot force their [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=726.7s)]
*  tribesmen to make certain choices. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=732.46s)]
*  Tribes are governed by customary law. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=736.22s)]
*  Their main means for resolving conflicts is negotiations rather than force and the ultimate [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=739.0600000000001s)]
*  goal of customary law is to preserve social cohesion and achieve long term reconciliation [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=743.66s)]
*  beyond violent conflicts. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=749.46s)]
*  Tribes normally avoid the use of force unless they've exhausted every other means for [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=752.4200000000001s)]
*  peacefully resolve the situation. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=757.26s)]
*  They'll come to compromises to prevent their areas from becoming a zone for violent conflicts [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=759.22s)]
*  and they will generally avoid fighting in their own areas unless they're faced with [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=766.74s)]
*  immediate threat. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=770.78s)]
*  Now tribes have varying degrees of control in Yemen but they're increasingly challenged [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=773.9s)]
*  by the political turmoil and the deterioration of the security situation and the war. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=780.9s)]
*  Now the mainstream assumption about the tribes is that they offer safe haven for AQAP but [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=791.54s)]
*  evidence from research indicate that AQAP strength does not stem from Yemeni tribes [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=798.54s)]
*  or their relationship with the Yemeni tribes. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=803.9s)]
*  The AQAP spread in tribal areas for the same reasons that it spread in urban areas as well. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=806.9s)]
*  AQAP militants managed to recruit members among tribes mainly by tapping into deep grievances [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=813.9s)]
*  and resentment against the central government and in particularly the targeted youth who [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  have no opportunity and limited education. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=831.1s)]
*  But while AQAP recruited tribesmen and in some instances made their way into tribes [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=834.42s)]
*  through some tribal leaders, it was never able, the militant group was never able to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=839.78s)]
*  recruit a tribe and was never successful, so far has failed to strike an alliance with [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=845.62s)]
*  any Yemeni tribe. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=852.62s)]
*  I argue that the tribes have played a critical role in preventing AQAP from making substantial [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=853.9s)]
*  gains in Yemen. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=861.0999999999999s)]
*  Without the tribes, I think, based on my research and other people as well, I think AQAP would [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=862.9s)]
*  have been much greater threat to Yemen and to the west. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=868.6999999999999s)]
*  Tribes have pushed AQAP from Abian in 2012, they pushed AQAP from Baida, from Radha, just [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=880.34s)]
*  90 miles south of Sana'a in 2012. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=886.74s)]
*  And even under the current war, AQAP left major cities in south Yemen last year, not [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=891.5s)]
*  because of military offensive but mainly because of, as a result of tribal mediation, as a [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=898.82s)]
*  result of pressure from tribes. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=904.54s)]
*  And AQAP was able to establish control and govern in areas that are of a weaker tribal [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=907.62s)]
*  structure. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=915.82s)]
*  So the dynamics of the relationship, tribes are stronger than AQAP and AQAP is not strong [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=917.9s)]
*  to challenge the tribes yet. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=924.34s)]
*  AQAP has always been careful not to challenge the tribes and to avoid confronting and has [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=926.66s)]
*  been keen to avoid confronting with them. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=934.5s)]
*  The group believes that the biggest threat to them, not the U.S. military, not the Yemeni [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=937.02s)]
*  military but the Yemeni tribes, because they know if the tribes turn against them, they [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=941.02s)]
*  cannot stand a chance. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=945.66s)]
*  Now the tribes see AQAP as a threat but they never use the force against them. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=948.38s)]
*  That's because the tribes fear that the use of force might instigate violence within the [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=952.98s)]
*  tribes, mainly between members of tribes who are opposed to AQAP and others who are supportive. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=959.66s)]
*  And there were clashes in the past that happened after interventions peaceful or by using force [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=966.9s)]
*  to push AQAP out that led to violence within the tribes. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=973.54s)]
*  So the tribes try to avoid that because it destabilizes the order within the tribes. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=977.54s)]
*  Also the tribes have never gotten enough support or commitment from the government to fight [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=986.38s)]
*  AQAP and they never were able to do it on their own. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=991.5s)]
*  So the tribes have always implemented a strategy of containment rather than direct confrontation [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=995.3s)]
*  with AQAP. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1002.3s)]
*  How much? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1004.6999999999999s)]
*  Five minutes. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1005.6999999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'll wrap up. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1006.6999999999999s)]
*  Okay, so that was all before the war. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1009.6999999999999s)]
*  It's still the case. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1013.3s)]
*  But in this current war, the AQAP has gained a lot more presence among the tribes, particularly [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1014.38s)]
*  in areas where there is fighting between the Houthis and local tribes such as Baida. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1023.74s)]
*  The tribes who have previously been opposed to AQAP welcomed the help of the AQAP to help [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1029.66s)]
*  them get out of their areas. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1036.94s)]
*  A classic example of the enemy of my enemy rather than sympathy with AQAP. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1039.38s)]
*  But the tribes still see AQAP as a threat, but they see Houthis as a larger threat to [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1049.02s)]
*  them, as a more pressing, greater threat to them. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1054.94s)]
*  Tribes perceive Houthis as outside aggressors and an extension of the imamate, which is [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1059.8200000000002s)]
*  a theocracy that ruled Yemen and exploited tribes in mid and lower Yemen, which is where [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1068.6200000000001s)]
*  the AQAP has spread until 1962. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1074.0600000000002s)]
*  Now, Houthis have humiliated the tribes. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1079.0600000000002s)]
*  They have committed atrocities against them. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1084.5400000000002s)]
*  They abducted, arbitrarily arrested, killed and blew up the houses of their opponents, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1087.14s)]
*  including tribal leaders. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1091.5800000000002s)]
*  By contrast, AQAP never challenged the authority of the tribes and even protected them when [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1093.9s)]
*  they needed. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1101.6200000000001s)]
*  For the tribes, AQAP is tomorrow's problem, but Houthis are today's existential threat [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1103.1000000000001s)]
*  that they need to deal with right now. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1109.5s)]
*  So the longer the fighting between Houthis and local tribes lasts, the more influence [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1112.78s)]
*  AQAP will have. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1117.5s)]
*  And the longer the war continues, the weaker the tribes will be. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1119.42s)]
*  And it's only a matter of time before the last line of defense against AQAP that has [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1123.46s)]
*  been effective so far, which is the AMA tribes, breaks down. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1128.3s)]
*  Okay, thank you. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1136.3s)]
*  You pick it up. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1137.3s)]
*  I'll give all the answers. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1138.3s)]
*  Okay, first of all, thanks to you, Fred, and to the Carnegie Endowment for giving us this [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1140.82s)]
*  opportunity to talk to you today. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1146.3s)]
*  And thanks to the audience for coming. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1148.3799999999999s)]
*  I wanted to cover four elements of international community engagement in the Yemen conflict. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1150.78s)]
*  One, support for a resolution to the Yemen civil war. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1157.78s)]
*  Two, the urgent efforts to address critical humanitarian requirements. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1162.3s)]
*  Third is the role of the Saudi-led coalition in supporting an end to the conflict, but [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1168.78s)]
*  also in the post-conflict period, which I think is extremely important. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1173.1s)]
*  And finally, to suggest an approach to addressing the resurgence of AQAP and violent extremism [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1177.94s)]
*  as Nedwa covered. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1184.46s)]
*  I wanted to begin the discussion on the political situation with a word about the GCC initiative [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1187.34s)]
*  and the implementing mechanism. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1193.58s)]
*  Many observers have argued, and Feria, I think, would agree, that the GCC initiative was flawed [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1196.9s)]
*  and that a new political process should be launched that would expand participation both [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1204.46s)]
*  demographically and regionally, therefore potentially bringing about an outcome that's [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1210.02s)]
*  more reflective of broader Yemeni preferences. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1219.02s)]
*  In my view, many of the criticisms of the GCC initiative fail to acknowledge that the [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1224.34s)]
*  negotiators of the initiative did attempt to address all or many of these shortcomings. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1229.1s)]
*  They did require expanded participation by women and youth in the political process and [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1237.22s)]
*  even beyond the political process in all of the structures and all of the mechanisms of [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1243.02s)]
*  the state. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1248.8999999999999s)]
*  They insisted that there be adequate representation from the south and the north of the north, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1250.02s)]
*  and they established a national dialogue process with the intent of addressing core challenges [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1256.94s)]
*  to Yemen that went beyond the immediate political crisis. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1263.1000000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't argue, I wouldn't suggest that the GCC initiative was flawless, but I would [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1267.98s)]
*  say that based on my own experience as one of the people working on that process, that [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1275.62s)]
*  in my view it was the best solution that was attainable within the context of the Yemeni [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1281.94s)]
*  reality at the time. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1289.94s)]
*  I therefore think that it would be extremely optimistic to suggest that a new effort to [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1292.3s)]
*  start from scratch and negotiate a new agreement on a political arrangement in Yemen would [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1299.66s)]
*  bring about a different or substantially better result. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1306.1000000000001s)]
*  In fact, in my view, given the deepened fractures in Yemeni society as a result of the civil [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1309.74s)]
*  conflict, I think it would be extremely unlikely to bring about any positive outcome, let alone [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1316.74s)]
*  one that would improve on what we've already got. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1324.9s)]
*  So the question is, what does that mean for the role of the international community? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1328.26s)]
*  In my view, I think that concluding the political transition process under the terms of the [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1335.58s)]
*  GCC initiative and the outcomes of the national dialogue conference should remain as the core [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1341.3s)]
*  objective for negotiating the resolution of the current civil conflict. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1347.74s)]
*  In order to accomplish that, the international community should support the UN effort that's [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1352.58s)]
*  underway under the leadership of Special Envoy Ismail al-Sheikh Ahmed within the context [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1357.66s)]
*  of UNSCR 2216. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1363.94s)]
*  The international community should continue to insist that the legitimate government of [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1367.14s)]
*  Yemen be able to return to Sana'a and reestablish its functions, including maintaining law and [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1371.94s)]
*  order in the capital. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1378.82s)]
*  But that also would permit negotiations on governance issues between the parties to continue [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1381.98s)]
*  once everyone is back in Sana'a. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1390.34s)]
*  But in my view, any subsequent arrangement on changes to the governing structure should [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1393.3s)]
*  be on the basis of mutual agreement and should be time limited, lasting only long enough [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1398.54s)]
*  to complete implementation of the GCC initiative and permit formation of a new government chosen [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1404.8600000000001s)]
*  by the Yemeni people themselves. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1411.66s)]
*  And I would point out in that regard that the last time Yemenis have actually had the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1414.18s)]
*  opportunity to go to the polls and choose their own government was in 2007. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1420.0600000000002s)]
*  And people will argue whether that was a legitimate process either. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1426.0600000000002s)]
*  You could maybe go all the way back to 2003. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1428.9s)]
*  And therefore, that elections are long overdue. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1432.76s)]
*  Secondly, addressing the humanitarian crisis should be, in my view, as much of a priority, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1438.18s)]
*  if not even a greater priority for the international community as is ending the conflict. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1443.9s)]
*  There is on the table a proposal to allow mutually accepted third parties to assume [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1451.02s)]
*  control of the port of Hodeida and the Sana'a International Airport, opening them for humanitarian [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1456.3000000000002s)]
*  supplies, ensuring that they're not used for smuggling arms and other contraband into [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1463.18s)]
*  the country, and managing onward distribution to communities regardless of their political [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1468.14s)]
*  affiliation. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1473.74s)]
*  Urgent repairs of the port of Hodeida to restore its full capacity, utilizing equipment which [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1474.74s)]
*  is already pre-positioned in the region by the U.S., should be a part of any agreement [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1482.42s)]
*  to reopen the port. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1487.42s)]
*  The Hadi government and the Saudi-led coalition have accepted this proposal. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1489.66s)]
*  The Houthis have not. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1493.8200000000002s)]
*  My understanding is that the Houthi reluctance to accept the proposal relates to the loss [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1495.5800000000002s)]
*  of the enormous financial windfall that they gained through the control of Hodeida port. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1501.1000000000001s)]
*  The international community should increase pressure on the Houthis to agree to this arrangement. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1507.54s)]
*  Hodeida serves the 75 percent of the Yemeni population that lives in the north. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1512.8600000000001s)]
*  And similarly, the continued closure of Sana'a Airport has imposed extremely negative effects [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1518.22s)]
*  on thousands of Yemenis. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1525.34s)]
*  If Iran were to want to play a positive role in addressing the needs of the Yemeni people, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1528.18s)]
*  as opposed to sustaining the conflict, this would be a golden opportunity for it to demonstrate [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1533.04s)]
*  goodwill by using its influence with the Houthis to press them to cooperate on the proposal. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1538.46s)]
*  In addition to reopening Hodeida and Sana'a port, the international community should press [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1545.82s)]
*  both the government and the Houthi-Salah alliance to restore the functioning of the central [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1551.44s)]
*  bank. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1556.02s)]
*  And this goes back to Faria's point. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1557.02s)]
*  A key element of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is not related to the absence of food [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1558.46s)]
*  and other essential supplies in the country. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1563.86s)]
*  In fact, they are available. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1565.98s)]
*  It's the absence of the means to purchase available supplies. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1568.06s)]
*  Twenty-five percent of Yemenis depend on government payments for their income. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1572.38s)]
*  The inability or unwillingness to continue these payments has compounded the crisis. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1577.74s)]
*  The international community should insist that the parties cooperate in reestablishing [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1582.58s)]
*  the central bank, ensuring that it can function outside of the political conflict, and continuing [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1587.26s)]
*  to explore measures like the establishment of a trust fund that would guarantee that [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1593.1200000000001s)]
*  the central bank would have the resources that it requires in order to capitalize economic [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1597.9s)]
*  activity. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1602.98s)]
*  The Yemeni conflict is primarily a civil war, and the decision to end the conflict is primarily [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1605.14s)]
*  in the hands of the Yemeni parties to the civil war. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1610.5800000000002s)]
*  Nevertheless, the Yemeni people and the international community look to Saudi Arabia and its coalition [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1613.5400000000002s)]
*  partners to provide assurance that they will support a reasonable political agreement to [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1619.42s)]
*  end the fighting. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1625.96s)]
*  Based on my own experience discussing the conflict with senior Saudi officials, as well [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1627.24s)]
*  as the comments by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that have been recently made public, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1633.64s)]
*  I believe that Saudi Arabia would, in fact, welcome a conclusion to the conflict. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1639.44s)]
*  Undoubtedly, the Yemen conflict has imposed costs on Saudi Arabia in human and financial [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1643.92s)]
*  terms, as well as in damage to its international reputation, that were unanticipated at the [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1650.68s)]
*  beginning of the conflict. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1656.32s)]
*  That said, I believe that Saudi Arabia will identify three core elements of an agreement [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1658.72s)]
*  that it can support. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1663.72s)]
*  One, the presence of a government in Sana'a that will maintain friendly relations with [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1665.64s)]
*  Riyadh. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1670.88s)]
*  Two, security for the Saudi-Yemeni border and an end to cross-border violations. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1671.88s)]
*  And third, no hostile Iranian presence in Yemen. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1678.12s)]
*  In regard to the first requirement of a friendly government, the Saudis have been clear that [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1682.52s)]
*  they are not opposed to Houthi participation in a future Yemeni government, provided that [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1687.3999999999999s)]
*  they function as a political organization and not as an armed militia in the manner [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1693.9199999999998s)]
*  of Hezbollah. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1699.6s)]
*  The goals and objectives of the second partner in the coalition, the UAE, are less well-established. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1701.6s)]
*  The Emiratis join the coalition primarily to demonstrate support for Saudi Arabia and [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1708.12s)]
*  to underline their perception that the threat of the Yemeni conflict presented a challenge [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1713.96s)]
*  broadly to Gulf security and stability. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1721.6s)]
*  The Emirati leadership has been clear, both publicly and privately, that they regret that [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1725.28s)]
*  the conflict has not been resolved yet and that they would welcome its end. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1730.48s)]
*  Nevertheless, the deterioration of the Emirati relationship with the Hadi government, relations [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1735.04s)]
*  with southern secessionist elements at odd, and rumored negotiations with members of the [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1740.48s)]
*  Ali Abdullah Saleh family about their potential future role in Yemeni governance, raise questions [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1745.56s)]
*  about the UAE's continued commitment to abide by the terms of UNSCR-2216. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1752.3600000000001s)]
*  It's important that the international community remain very clear in its discussions with [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1760.16s)]
*  members of the coalition and others that its commitment to the UN negotiations and [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1764.72s)]
*  an outcome that is consistent with the relevant agreements, the GCC initiative, the outcomes [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  of the National Dialogue Conference and UNSCR-2216 is ironclad. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1776.72s)]
*  It's also important that the international community remain clear-eyed about the importance [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1783.44s)]
*  of achieving a resolution of the Yemen conflict that is reassuring to Yemen's Gulf neighbors. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1788.64s)]
*  Yemen's friends anticipate that Saudi Arabia and its Gulf partners will take the lead in [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1795.16s)]
*  guiding and financing essential reconstruction and development efforts in Yemen in the post-conflict period. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1801.16s)]
*  Welcoming Yemen into broader economic and social integration with its Gulf neighbors [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1807.96s)]
*  is potentially an important element of Yemen's future economic, political, and social stability. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1814.68s)]
*  It's unrealistic to expect that the Saudis and their partners would take on their anticipated [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1822.28s)]
*  role in a scenario where they perceive that the outcome of the conflict left their security [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1828.08s)]
*  and national interests under threat. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1835.12s)]
*  Finally, a word on the equally important issue of the effort to defeat al-Qaeda in the Arabian [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1837.56s)]
*  Peninsula, AQAP, and other extremist groups. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1845.32s)]
*  In a welcome development, the UAE in particular has committed to confront terrorist groups, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1850.5600000000002s)]
*  successfully pushing AQAP out of Makala and now expanding the fight to Shabwah. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  The U.S. has supported that effort and has also resumed its own engagement to turn back [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1861.44s)]
*  AQAP's efforts to capitalize on the political conflict in the country and regain ground [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1866.5600000000002s)]
*  at loss during the period of 2011 to 2014 that featured cooperation and coordination [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1872.8400000000001s)]
*  between the United States and the government of Yemen. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1879.48s)]
*  But in pursuing the fight against AQAP, it's absolutely essential that care be taken to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1883.04s)]
*  distinguish between those elements truly committed to AQAP's ideological embrace of global jihad [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1887.84s)]
*  and those Yemenis who might have turned to AQ not out of any ideological commitment, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1896.72s)]
*  but because they believe they were engaged in an existential fight with domestic opponents [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1904.1599999999999s)]
*  and saw AQAP as a source of needed arms and finance. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1909.48s)]
*  I agree entirely with Nadeau on this point. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1913.56s)]
*  Frankly speaking, I think for many Yemenis, Yemeni tribes, they don't see AQ any differently [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1916.6s)]
*  than they see the government of Yemen, or in fact any differently than they see the [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1923.6s)]
*  United States as some entity that they can use to their own advantage and their own requirements. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1927.12s)]
*  Once the fighting has ended and the time has come to renew the focus on the fight against [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1936.4399999999998s)]
*  extremism, we will need to rebuild relations with the latter group and regain their support [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1940.84s)]
*  in the effort to eliminate AQ. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1948.7199999999998s)]
*  If we fail to distinguish between these two groups, we run the risk of losing access to [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1951.34s)]
*  potential allies in the future, making the fight against AQAP infinitely more difficult, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1956.92s)]
*  if not impossible. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1964.0s)]
*  And I'll stop there. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1965.6000000000001s)]
*  Wonderful. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1967.24s)]
*  Well, thank you all for the comprehensive but concise presentations. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1968.24s)]
*  We stayed well within the limit, which gives a lot of time for questions. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1973.68s)]
*  I'm going to take the first round, just a few follow-ups. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1976.92s)]
*  Farah, on your trip, I think you also went to Muscat. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1980.48s)]
*  Can you say a bit about Oman's role in this and what you felt on the ground from Oman's [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1985.92s)]
*  efforts? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1991.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1992.68s)]
*  I mean, Oman is one of the only Gulf countries that wasn't part of the coalition. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=1993.68s)]
*  It has tried to detach itself from the military operations in Yemen, and it does have a quite [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2000.8200000000002s)]
*  – because of that, it does have a quite leverage over the Houthis. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2007.96s)]
*  But to my understanding, it's even higher than actually the leverage of the Iranians [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2011.92s)]
*  and actually is higher than the leverage of any other actor among the Houthis because [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2015.88s)]
*  they, one, again, have not been bombing them, but two, have played this side track of brokers [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2020.64s)]
*  between them and the rest of the Gulf countries, sometimes even organized the secret negotiations, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2028.92s)]
*  sometimes organized the meeting between the Americans and the Houthis. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2034.7600000000002s)]
*  The Omanis enjoy very much the backseat. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2037.88s)]
*  Usually, they don't like media. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2040.3200000000002s)]
*  They don't talk to the media. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2042.2800000000002s)]
*  They have quite rules for negotiations that goes back from the Iranian deal to the current [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2043.88s)]
*  one, and they have tried to, again, keep themselves away from this larger regional fragmentation, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2049.08s)]
*  whether on Yemen or in Syria or in different other crises over the region. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2056.08s)]
*  It does not have hostile relationship with the Saudis. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2062.28s)]
*  It can have hostile relationship with the UAE. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2065.2s)]
*  It has a different agenda with UAE than it has with Saudi or more different. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2068.6s)]
*  Right now, it has also a new ally inside the Gulf, which is Kuwait, but Kuwait is assigned [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2073.9199999999996s)]
*  to solve the Qatar crisis, not the Yemeni crisis. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2080.3199999999997s)]
*  One main thing is the Oman have not used – they have used their leverage over the Houthis [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2085.48s)]
*  to solve a problem between the Houthis and outsiders. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2091.24s)]
*  They still haven't used it or used that leverage to mediate between the Houthis and other Yemenis, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2094.76s)]
*  which is really Houthis' main problem. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2101.0s)]
*  Main problem is not with the Saudis or with the internet. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2102.84s)]
*  Their very main problem they are facing right now is with Yemenis, and that's the biggest [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2106.96s)]
*  obstacle they are going to face in the long term, specifically because MBS and Abdulmalik [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2110.8s)]
*  and Houthi war is not because they are that much different, but rather because they couldn't [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2117.96s)]
*  be best friends. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2122.68s)]
*  Yet there is a lot of similarities that exist in that and more than any differences between [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2124.08s)]
*  the two cities or as powers or as even a perception of life and politics overall in Yemen. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2129.7599999999998s)]
*  Great. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2136.72s)]
*  And, Nadhwa, you gave us a really granular view of the tribes and their relationships. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2137.72s)]
*  Can you just sort of operationalize this? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2143.8399999999997s)]
*  How do tribes interact with outside actors and how do outside actors try to influence [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2147.6s)]
*  tribes? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2152.56s)]
*  I mean, there is this sort of policy mystique about tribes that they can be mobilized from [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2153.56s)]
*  the outside. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2156.16s)]
*  And how does that work in practice from both the regional but also maybe U.S. perspective? [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2157.16s)]
*  Tribes are not isolated entities in Yemen and outside Yemen. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2163.6s)]
*  Tribal leaders and tribal members have been members of tribes, members of government, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2166.8399999999997s)]
*  members of Salih government and his opposition leaders were tribal leaders. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2171.48s)]
*  The tribes were engaged in the National Dialogue Conference. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2177.04s)]
*  A lot of tribesmen are in Saudi right now. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2180.92s)]
*  So they're there. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2183.96s)]
*  They're engaged in the process. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2185.28s)]
*  But they haven't been, the tribes have not been engaged previously by the Yemeni government [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2187.36s)]
*  in Salih and in Hadi in the war against the AQAP. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2194.92s)]
*  Honestly, because I think Salih and Hadi were not really committed to fight, committed, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2201.36s)]
*  they did not have a commitment to fight AQAP. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2209.4s)]
*  And in fact, Salih exploited AQAP, used AQAP for his own purposes to eliminate his opponents [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2211.4s)]
*  and to keep money coming from the West. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2218.88s)]
*  So I think the tribes remain the untapped potential. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2222.2400000000002s)]
*  They're accessible. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2226.7200000000003s)]
*  They like to talk. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2228.36s)]
*  They like to compromise. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2230.04s)]
*  And they know better than anybody else in their own local complex what is best that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2232.68s)]
*  can be done, not only to fight AQAP and remind the group, but also to establish security [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2237.84s)]
*  and governance in their own areas. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2244.4s)]
*  And I think they need to be engaged at a local level, case by case. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2246.44s)]
*  And you talked about the UAE efforts in Shebuah and Hadramaut. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2252.48s)]
*  And I think the problem with the UAE effort, although I think there might be good intentions, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2256.76s)]
*  I think the problem is that they have excluded certain tribes. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2263.84s)]
*  For example, in Shebuah, the Shebuah elite forces that are managed by the Emiratis, they [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2267.0s)]
*  raided tribes that are formed of certain tribes. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2272.32s)]
*  They excluded Al-Awalik tribe, which is the largest in Shebuah and is the tribe where [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2277.64s)]
*  AQAP is active. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2282.44s)]
*  So I think even though these efforts are welcome in principle, I think they haven't been sensitive [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2284.8s)]
*  for the tribal conflicts and they have been more based on a traditional security approach [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2290.04s)]
*  rather than engaging the tribes and engaging the community, which is what we need to do. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2295.16s)]
*  Ambassador, in your presentation you mentioned the I word, which gets a lot of currency around [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2302.16s)]
*  here, Iran, the role of Iran. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2308.68s)]
*  How do you think about Iran's role? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2310.68s)]
*  Can you say a bit more? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2312.88s)]
*  You said if they choose not to sustain the conflict anymore, but they can play a role [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2313.88s)]
*  in brokering peace by pressing the Houthis. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2317.7599999999998s)]
*  What's your conception of Iran's centrality to this, their actual influence on the ground? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2320.68s)]
*  Well, there's no question, I think, that Iran has been involved in the Yemeni conflict in [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2327.68s)]
*  an extremely negative way, that Iran has exploited the situation inside of Iran in order basically [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2336.7599999999998s)]
*  to threaten primarily Saudi, but more broadly Gulf security and stability, and that that [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2346.64s)]
*  was done provocatively and basically resulted. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2353.72s)]
*  That was a key component of the Saudi decision to intervene in the Yemen conflict in March [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2360.7999999999997s)]
*  of 2015. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2367.48s)]
*  So the Iranian role, which actually goes all the way back, and one of the things that I [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2369.8799999999997s)]
*  think is important to keep in mind is that Iran began its efforts to provide military [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2376.92s)]
*  training and assistance to the Houthis at least in 2012, if not prior to 2012. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2386.28s)]
*  So at a period in which, in fact, there was a broad movement within Yemen to try to achieve [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2394.8s)]
*  a peaceful political transition, the Iranians were already smuggling weapons to the Houthis. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2402.7999999999997s)]
*  They were already sending IRGC and Hezbollah trainers to Saada. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2410.04s)]
*  So their role, which primarily has been directed by the IRGC and the Quds Force up until this [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2417.6s)]
*  point, has been a negative one. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2424.6s)]
*  The question is whether there is within Iran a sense that, A, if they wanted to reduce [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2427.26s)]
*  tensions in the region, and B, if the Rouhani government were ready to challenge the IRGC [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2437.0400000000004s)]
*  and the Iran hardliners, that you could make the argument that one place that they could [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2447.0400000000004s)]
*  achieve quick success would be in Yemen. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2454.44s)]
*  Yemen is not important for Iran. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2457.98s)]
*  It never has been important for Iran. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2459.42s)]
*  It is important for Saudi Arabia. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2461.08s)]
*  And therefore, if they wanted to do something to reach out to the Saudis, that would be [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2463.88s)]
*  a good place for them to do it. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2468.42s)]
*  And that, I think, is an idea that we, maybe not necessarily the United States, but that [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2470.7999999999997s)]
*  others, the UN or others, might explore. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2477.98s)]
*  And if I may, on that point, I think it's important to realize that probably Iran's [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2483.62s)]
*  role in Yemen is destructive, like anywhere else in the region. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2488.18s)]
*  But there is three myths that usually goes with talking about Iran and Yemen. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2492.94s)]
*  First, the Iranians, just like everyone else, they were surprised by the takeover of the [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2498.46s)]
*  Sana'a by the Houthis. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2502.46s)]
*  It was a surprise to them. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2503.46s)]
*  It was a surprise. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2505.02s)]
*  And the Houthis would have taken Sana'a with Iran and without Iran help. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2506.42s)]
*  And in fact, what happened also in addition to that is they took, there was even a Gulf [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2510.34s)]
*  okay for the Houthis to take over Sana'a by that time, two years ago. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2515.5800000000004s)]
*  There was too many local dynamics and too many Gulf internal crises that they actually [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2519.9s)]
*  were happy with the Houthis when it comes to taking this down. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2524.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't, you know, I think even by now the Houthis realize that their relationship with [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2528.3s)]
*  Saudi is more important than relationship with Iran. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2533.78s)]
*  And again, they are fighting not because they are Hezbollah in Yemen, but rather, in my [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2536.92s)]
*  opinion, because they are looking for attention from within the Saudis. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2542.1600000000003s)]
*  I, you know, probably the Iranians gave some sort of building capacity to the Houthis, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2547.12s)]
*  but you will never really need to teach Yemenis how to fight, let alone the Houthis, a group [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2553.4s)]
*  that has emerged on fight since 2004. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2558.36s)]
*  And finally, I mean, the Houthis even right now, to my knowledge, make more money on a [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2563.2s)]
*  black market and buy weapons from the government outside more than they actually get from Iran. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2569.96s)]
*  Iran has looked at them as a very little low cost problem they can raise in Saudis face [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2576.3999999999996s)]
*  more than really as a strategic ally. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2583.04s)]
*  Interestingly, the Iran has dealt with Yemen exactly the same way U.S. has dealt with Yemen. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2586.24s)]
*  The U.S. has offshore Yemen to Saudi, and the Iranians have offshore Yemen to Hezbollah. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2593.64s)]
*  It's almost their biggest contractor in Yemen is Hezbollah. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2600.6s)]
*  They don't even deal with it directly, just exactly like the U.S. and Yemen and going [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2603.7599999999998s)]
*  through Saudi. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2608.84s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't agree with all of that, but anyway. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2609.84s)]
*  I'm not saying Saudi is like Hezbollah. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2614.48s)]
*  So we are going to have lots of questions. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2617.12s)]
*  So we'll take questions three at a time. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2618.3199999999997s)]
*  Please introduce yourself, identify yourself, and please do ask a question. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2620.88s)]
*  So we'll start with you, sir. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2625.44s)]
*  We'll wait for the mic if you wouldn't mind. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2628.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2631.6400000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2650.84s)]
*  My name is Mohammed Al-Hazrami. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2654.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm the political counselor at the Yemen embassy here in D.C. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2655.1200000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much for organizing this, and I thank the panelists for very informative [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2659.52s)]
*  and lucid presentations. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2663.08s)]
*  I have actually two questions with some comments in between. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2665.0s)]
*  As you know, Yemen, it's not only affected by its surroundings, it's also affected by [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2669.2400000000002s)]
*  its internal dynamics, like any other conflict. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2674.52s)]
*  And for Fadiah, that leads me to the question, haven't been lucky enough to be in Sana'a [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2677.64s)]
*  recently. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2682.2s)]
*  The most talked topic in Sana'a now is the friction between Salih and the Houthis. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2683.44s)]
*  I want to hear your insights, and also what are the perspectives of the residents of Sana'a [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2688.64s)]
*  of this conflict? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2694.44s)]
*  Do you think it's the beginning at the end of this fragile conflict, and how, in your [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2695.44s)]
*  opinion, it would affect the future peace talks? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2700.64s)]
*  The plan for ambassadors, always good to see you and to hear your thoughts. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2703.6s)]
*  You mentioned Hodeidah plan, which, as you know, averted a military option that the government [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2707.72s)]
*  was seeking to liberate Hodeidah and to get all the profiteering from aid and all the [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2713.44s)]
*  abuses. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2717.7599999999998s)]
*  The government agreed. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2718.7599999999998s)]
*  The Houthis refused. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2720.72s)]
*  You mentioned pressures in your presentation. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2722.6s)]
*  So what kind of pressures do you think? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2726.12s)]
*  How can the government, the international community, do to help Wolde Sheikh persuade [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2728.3199999999997s)]
*  the Houthis to come back to another round peace talks? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2734.2s)]
*  Because without this, I don't think we could get it over. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2738.7599999999998s)]
*  And thank you very much. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2742.08s)]
*  Hi, my name is Kate Kaiser. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2755.12s)]
*  I'm with the Yemen Peace Project. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2756.12s)]
*  My question is for Farah and Nadwa. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2758.2s)]
*  I wonder if you could speak to the issue of accountability. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2760.64s)]
*  Over the last, since 2011, really, there has not been an internationally led investigation [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2765.12s)]
*  to abuses by all sides, and abuses by all sides continue with impunity in the conflict. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2770.4399999999996s)]
*  And I wonder what role the international community can take and maybe use that as leverage to [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2776.24s)]
*  push for peace. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2781.72s)]
*  Very important question. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2782.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2788.8799999999997s)]
*  My name is Jonathan Apikian with Partners Global. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2789.8799999999997s)]
*  Thank you all for your very insightful remarks. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2792.8399999999997s)]
*  I just had a quick question in particular for the Yemeni panelists and Nadwa and Farah. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2794.96s)]
*  As most of us know, Yemen has a very rich tradition of conflict resolution and mediation [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2801.3999999999996s)]
*  historically. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2807.7599999999998s)]
*  And in many ways, if this war was up to Yemenis themselves to resolve, it probably would have [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2810.52s)]
*  been resolved. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2815.64s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2817.2799999999997s)]
*  There's so many outside actors. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2818.2799999999997s)]
*  And we know, and we have seen a lot of traction at the local level, especially local tribes [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2820.4799999999996s)]
*  making progress in traction in the peace process at the local level, whether we talk about [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2827.8399999999997s)]
*  prisoners swaps. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2833.3999999999996s)]
*  I know last year in Taiz, there was a very large prison swap that was mediated by local [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2834.3999999999996s)]
*  tribes where it has been Omar to months and months and only released four prisoners. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2839.0s)]
*  So my question is, what can the international community do to harness the power of local [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2846.12s)]
*  mediation that exists in Yemen, to harness the historical traditions, whether it's customary [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2852.92s)]
*  law or otherwise, that exist in Yemen of conflict resolution? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2860.08s)]
*  Because I think that's very much lacking. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2863.72s)]
*  And if there was an opportunity to grasp and build on that, we would make much more progress [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2865.7999999999997s)]
*  in the peace process. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2869.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2871.4s)]
*  Why don't we start with that last question on the local resolution, if you guys want [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2876.16s)]
*  to take that. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2881.88s)]
*  I mean, you're right. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2887.88s)]
*  The tribes, even under the current war, even in areas where they're fighting, they still [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2889.08s)]
*  continue to carry conflict resolution. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2893.56s)]
*  There were a few very complex tribal conflicts that have been solved this year in Baida and [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2896.2s)]
*  in Ma'rib that have been around for quite, one is 40 years and the other one is 20 years [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2902.68s)]
*  between tribes, but they were resolved in the current war. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2910.9199999999996s)]
*  During the current war, the tribes have taken measures in order to avoid, in order to mitigate [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2914.2s)]
*  the impact of the conflicts and the fighting on the dynamics between the tribes themselves. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2920.64s)]
*  As you said, they have helped in defusing some tensions and in prisoner swabs. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2927.6s)]
*  I think the one thing that the international community need to do is stop being solely [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2934.08s)]
*  focused on the national process. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2939.48s)]
*  It's important to focus on the peace process. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2942.12s)]
*  It's important to focus on bringing the sides, the main sides of the conflict into an agreement, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2944.52s)]
*  although I doubt that that would happen because I don't see these sides committed to peace [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2949.8399999999997s)]
*  more than the war because they benefit from the war than peace. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2955.32s)]
*  I think what should be done is take a localized approach case by case. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2959.36s)]
*  The sides are different than Ma'rib, is different than Baida, is different than Sheba, is different [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2964.36s)]
*  than Abiyan. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2967.76s)]
*  So from a peace perspective and from a security perspective, we need to take these case by [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2968.92s)]
*  case. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2974.48s)]
*  We need to engage the tribes. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2975.48s)]
*  I talked about undermining AKAP, but I think tribes need to be also engaged in terms of [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2977.48s)]
*  local reconciliation because this war, as Fahd mentioned, it affected the communities, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2983.64s)]
*  it affected the society. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2989.92s)]
*  It created conflicts at a very, very local level, which hasn't happened before in Yemen. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2990.92s)]
*  And so the tribal mechanisms, the tribes can help mitigate tensions at that level so that [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=2995.68s)]
*  we prevent total collapse of the society. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3001.0s)]
*  And it's true that Yemen has not collapsed so far because it has had a strong society, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3004.7599999999998s)]
*  but that's changing. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3013.12s)]
*  And I think the tribes can mitigate that change and kind of slow down and in some cases reverse [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3014.12s)]
*  that kind of deterioration in the society. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3019.08s)]
*  A question to both of you on accountability. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3022.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if I take a few minutes. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3026.56s)]
*  Look, I think the investigative committee is the most clear or the biggest evidence [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3031.56s)]
*  of how un-serious the international community is about in Yemen, about peace, how not serious [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3037.28s)]
*  it is. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3042.68s)]
*  This is important because, and this was the biggest flaw with the GCCD. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3043.68s)]
*  I don't have any better argument than today's unfortunate reality to say that there was [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3046.68s)]
*  a problematic community. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3053.68s)]
*  Ultimately, it led to this war, whether we like it or not. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3054.68s)]
*  And I think that happened because of the absence of accountability. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3057.92s)]
*  When you have someone like Saleh and you give him accountability, you give him immunity [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3061.7599999999998s)]
*  and you make it very unconditional. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  So you have someone who is the head of a mafia and the head of a state and suddenly he's [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3068.08s)]
*  just the head of the mafia. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3073.08s)]
*  Since 2011, they have been blocking all investigative committees internationally speaking. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3074.08s)]
*  And that has been the best thing, not just to the Saudis, but even to the Houthis. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3080.08s)]
*  Look to the siege on Ta'z. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3084.08s)]
*  They can do it. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3085.08s)]
*  They can continue because they are very sure that the government in Riyadh will actually [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3086.08s)]
*  block a creating investigative committee and the international community behind it. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3090.08s)]
*  That has been probably the most dangerous thing in Yemen and the region overall. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3093.3199999999997s)]
*  No accountability since this war started or since 2011. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3098.3199999999997s)]
*  And when you produce and when you introduce that legacy, you should not be surprised with [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3101.3199999999997s)]
*  violence that comes after it. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3105.92s)]
*  And it's something that one thing the U.S. can't start doing right now is basically stop [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3107.44s)]
*  blocking the creation of an international investigative committee in Geneva. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3111.4s)]
*  It's extremely important and I think it kind of played a big role. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3115.2s)]
*  On the Houthi-Saleh relationship, just like on every side, honeymoon is over. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3119.04s)]
*  They basically had to be, you know, found themselves on the same side. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3124.04s)]
*  And then second day they found that they have to answer bigger questions. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3128.04s)]
*  They have to share things. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3132.04s)]
*  They have to partner on a few things. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3134.04s)]
*  And that's what sparked violence between them or a fight between them. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3135.04s)]
*  This is specifically true right now in Sana'a. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3139.04s)]
*  The Houthis have the money and they have security. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3143.04s)]
*  Saleh has the politics and some of the weapons. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3146.52s)]
*  This is the division of right now of resources among between them in the ground in Sana'a. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3148.52s)]
*  And specifically on local mediation and on the tribes, yes, it can work. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3153.52s)]
*  It can do something. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3161.52s)]
*  But the problem right now is this is not anymore a war in the hand of Yemenis. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3162.52s)]
*  It is about Yemen. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3167.52s)]
*  It is in Yemen. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3168.52s)]
*  But it is not in the hand of Yemenis. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3169.52s)]
*  We can't end the local thing. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3171.52s)]
*  We can't hold the local facilitation, the tribal here and tribal there. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3174.0s)]
*  But there has to be a larger regional and international agreement to end the war in Yemen. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3177.0s)]
*  And it's possible. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3182.0s)]
*  Contrary to Libya, contrary to Syria, this is a solvable crisis. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3183.0s)]
*  This is a fight that everyone can end specifically. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3187.0s)]
*  But that decision has to happen. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3189.0s)]
*  And there is so much limit to what you can do with local mediation if you basically end the crisis here. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3191.0s)]
*  And then everyone from outside, from both sides keep weapons and money. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3198.0s)]
*  There is a limit to what you can do with that. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3202.48s)]
*  You can do a damage control. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3204.48s)]
*  You can maintain the social cohesion to a certain point. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3205.48s)]
*  But you cannot really achieve much. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3208.48s)]
*  There has to be a decision that there needs to be peace in Yemen. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3210.48s)]
*  That decision is not taken right now. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3213.48s)]
*  The UN might come now. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3215.48s)]
*  But the UN is no more capable of solving this crisis. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3216.48s)]
*  The UN needs absolute rebranding either from its involvement or from its process or from the way it has been in Yemen since 2011. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3219.48s)]
*  It was not as sensitive to a locally driven contextualized process. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3227.96s)]
*  The National Dialogue Conference was the most expensive and biggest networking event in the history of Yemen. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3231.96s)]
*  Did it do much beyond that? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3238.96s)]
*  No. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3240.96s)]
*  It brought some youth, brought some women. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3241.96s)]
*  Yes, they participated in the process. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3244.96s)]
*  But they participated in a faulty process. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3246.96s)]
*  There was an empowerment of youth, yes. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3249.96s)]
*  But there was an empowerment of youth to corruption. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3251.96s)]
*  Empowerment of youth to do what the elderly are doing. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3253.96s)]
*  Same applies with women. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3256.44s)]
*  That whole process needs to be rebranded, needs to be rethought from a local and international perspective. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3257.44s)]
*  Astor, the question on Hodeida? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3265.44s)]
*  Yes, but before I do that, I have to respond. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3267.44s)]
*  And fundamentally, as somebody who was very much involved in the whole effort to work out the GCC initiative, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3271.44s)]
*  I think the thing that people need to keep in mind is that the Yemeni society was divided in 2011. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3280.92s)]
*  This was not a situation where people could dictate to Ali Abdullah Saleh what the terms of the agreement were going to be. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3287.92s)]
*  The fact of the matter is, I like it or not, there would not have been a GCC initiative without the agreement to provide Ali Abdullah Saleh immunity. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3298.92s)]
*  Now, you can say that that was an unfortunate occurrence. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3307.4s)]
*  I wouldn't necessarily disagree with you. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3311.4s)]
*  I think that it would have been a good thing. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3313.4s)]
*  I think it would have been a good thing if we had been able to demand that Ali Abdullah Saleh leave Yemen and give up politics. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3315.4s)]
*  But that simply wasn't in the cards. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3321.4s)]
*  It was not realistic in 2011 to demand that. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3323.4s)]
*  And so the issue that we, who were trying to promote and to arrive at an agreement on a peaceful transition, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3327.88s)]
*  we're left with is that we could make accommodations and make compromises as unhappy and as unwelcome as they may have been. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3335.88s)]
*  Or we could have had Syria in 2011. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3343.88s)]
*  And if you want to argue that Syria has a happier outcome than Yemen does, we can have that conversation. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3347.88s)]
*  But I think that that was the reality, and I think that you have to accept and understand that that was the reality that we, who were trying to work on these issues, were confronted with. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3355.36s)]
*  In terms of Iran, what I would say is that, you know, Ismail has gone to Iran and tried to speak to them, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3365.36s)]
*  to talk to Zarif and to see whether there is scope within the Iranian context to be more helpful, more constructive in trying to approach this. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3378.84s)]
*  I mean, you know, part of the problem that we have right now is that the international community, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3389.84s)]
*  all of the weight, all of the influence that the international community has, is fundamentally on one side of the equation, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3393.84s)]
*  which is the government, the coalition, and therefore all of the emphasis, all of the focus is on the roles of the government and the coalition in all of this. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3401.32s)]
*  There is no countervailing pressure on the Houthis or Ali Abdullah Saleh to be responsive. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3412.32s)]
*  And so, you know, you ask whether Ismail can get people to come back to the negotiating table. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3419.32s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3426.8s)]
*  And I think it would be extremely helpful if we could engage the Iranians in some way, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3427.8s)]
*  not necessarily to demand or to force a Houthi outcome or Houthi cooperation, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3434.8s)]
*  but at least to put their finger on the scales to tip it that way and to make clear to the Houthis that they would welcome an outcome. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3441.8s)]
*  I agree with Farah that the Houthis are not a wholly owned subsidiary of the government of Iran or the IRGC or even Hezbollah, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3452.28s)]
*  but I don't agree that the Iranians don't have at least the capacity to have substantial influence on the way the Houthis think. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3461.28s)]
*  I also agree with the fact, and I've always agreed and always had the conversations with our friends in Saudi Arabia, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3470.28s)]
*  that ultimately the Houthis are not stupid. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3479.76s)]
*  They understand that they are always going to share a border with Saudi Arabia. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3481.76s)]
*  They're never going to share a border with Iran. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3487.76s)]
*  That eventually their interest lies in having a relationship with Saudi Arabia. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3490.76s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is that if you go back 18 months and look at the spring of 2016, that's exactly what was happening. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3495.76s)]
*  The last time that I was in Riyadh was in April of that year. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3502.76s)]
*  And in fact, at that time, there was a dialogue going on between the Houthis and the Saudis. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3507.2400000000002s)]
*  There was optimism. There was, in effect, a de facto, if not de jure, a ceasefire on the border. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3514.2400000000002s)]
*  The Saudis were sending significant humanitarian assistance to Sa'adna. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3523.2400000000002s)]
*  There was a prisoner exchange between the Saudis and the Houthis. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3528.2400000000002s)]
*  And so things were moving in a very positive direction. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3535.72s)]
*  And I can say that the Saudi leadership was quite optimistic that, in fact, they had cracked the code on the Houthis. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3539.72s)]
*  And so the question is what happened between the spring of 2016 and now, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3545.72s)]
*  and why did the Houthis pull away from that and resume the conflict with Saudi Arabia in the effort to threaten Saudi? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3552.72s)]
*  I think that certainly Iranian and Hezbollah influence played a role. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3561.2s)]
*  And the other thing that I would say about the Houthis, in my own sense, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3567.2s)]
*  is that people kind of think about the Houthis in a monolithic sense. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3574.2s)]
*  They think that all of the Houthis follow the leadership of Abd al-Malik al-Houthi. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3578.2s)]
*  I think that they follow the leadership of Abd al-Malik al-Houthi in the same way that the Iranians were all followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini when he was still alive, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3583.68s)]
*  which is that you have many different approaches. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3592.68s)]
*  Everybody says, yes, we're a follower of the Ayatollah, but they all follow him in their own ways. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3596.68s)]
*  And I think that within the Houthi structure, you have many different views, many different factions. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3603.68s)]
*  I think that there is a peace faction among the Houthis, but I also think that there is a faction within the Houthis, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3612.16s)]
*  particularly among elements who are in Sana'a that we encountered in a very negative way in 2015, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3618.16s)]
*  that is committed to an extremely aggressive approach to continuing the war. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3627.16s)]
*  And I think that those are the elements that are closest to the Iranians, closest to Hezbollah. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3635.16s)]
*  I mean, I agree and disagree. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3640.64s)]
*  I think the thing with the Houthis is they are very different groups, and there is no one pack you can put them in. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3642.64s)]
*  But I think the problem is not with the Houthis of Sa'adah, but rather with the Houthis of Sana'a. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3648.64s)]
*  The one who will block peace is actually the Houthis from Sana'a, who live off devalizing Sa'adah to the world and devalizing the world to Sa'adah. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3653.64s)]
*  Think of them as a weapon company in D.C. They benefit from a lot of disputes, a lot of problems. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3661.64s)]
*  They are a very problematic group within the Houthis who want basically, just like the war economy, except in a different way. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3669.12s)]
*  There are so many people who are benefiting all the way from Riyadh to Sa'adah and don't want to end this war, even when it is possible. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3676.12s)]
*  And I think that's what we just stood in front of many possible peace deals, is that war has established itself as an economy for everyone, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3682.12s)]
*  inside every group, that it is now too expensive to too many people to end this war. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3691.12s)]
*  Right. I agree with that completely. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3696.12s)]
*  Yes, Bill Hartung, Center for International Policy. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3699.12s)]
*  Two things that haven't come up, the Saudi bombing campaign and the civilian casualties, the allegations of torture by the UAE. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3708.12s)]
*  Doesn't the U.S. have to address that, maybe condition military support on getting to the bottom of that? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3715.12s)]
*  Can those things just be put to the side? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3722.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3727.6s)]
*  Hi, Laura Kaslidoff. I'm a journalist who worked in Yemen. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3735.6s)]
*  I have a question for Ambassador Farisdine. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3738.6s)]
*  I'm curious about what's going forward, and even talking about the GCC initiative going forward. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3742.6s)]
*  The things that went wrong in the past, which I'm sure we all have some different ideas, some of the same ideas of the things that went wrong in the past. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3750.08s)]
*  What is going to change going forward, and then particularly in regards to Salah, because that obviously was a big issue in the past. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3759.08s)]
*  Whether it be immunity and whether or not he would have agreed to step down, obviously, without the immunity. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3767.08s)]
*  But what's going to be done with him in the future and his family, particularly him. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3772.08s)]
*  And then also what's going to be done about Hadi's lack of legitimacy, I guess, and lack of popularity, particularly in Sanaa. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3776.56s)]
*  And then I have a question for Nadwa about tribalism. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3783.56s)]
*  And tribalism has sort of broken down in Yemen, at least that's how it used to be seen throughout the years, more and more, as people were moving to the cities. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3786.56s)]
*  And I'm curious if you think that this current conflict has changed that, or that it has continued to break down. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3797.56s)]
*  Or that it has sort of strengthened the role of the tribe. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3804.04s)]
*  I'm curious. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3808.04s)]
*  And then I have a final question for Farah, since he was recently in Yemen and particularly in AQAP areas about, you know, occasionally the media we see news about ISIS rising in Yemen or ISIS fighting with AQAP in Yemen or something like that. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3809.04s)]
*  And so I'm curious about your take on whether or not there's ISIS in Yemen. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3824.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3834.04s)]
*  Michael Kurtzig, retired from the Department of Agriculture. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3838.04s)]
*  And I will admit at the outset, I'm quite ignorant about the subject of Yemen. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3841.04s)]
*  And that's why I'm here to learn. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3846.04s)]
*  And your comments yesterday were excellent and the whole conference was excellent. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3847.04s)]
*  I'm looking from the economic side and I don't want to insult Yemen. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3851.04s)]
*  What is the attraction? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3854.04s)]
*  Is there oil? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3856.04s)]
*  Are there minerals there? [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3857.04s)]
*  Is there liquid natural gas sitting on an aqueduct of water the size of a Mediterranean or something? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3858.04s)]
*  What is constant fighting there? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3863.52s)]
*  And just to go back, it seems to me I remember 1975, Egypt was in there and there's always somebody in there from outside. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3866.52s)]
*  What do they want? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3873.52s)]
*  Is it strictly a strategic battle between? [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3874.52s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3877.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3880.52s)]
*  Go back to the question on the bombing campaign torture and conditionality on USAID. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3883.0s)]
*  Well, of course, the the Obama administration did pull back on on a number of the different aspects of of cooperation with Saudi Arabia from the time that the conflict began in March of 2015 until the end of the year. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3892.0s)]
*  My own view was that that was counterproductive. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3911.48s)]
*  I never agreed with it. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3918.48s)]
*  I didn't agree with it when I was in the State Department. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3920.48s)]
*  I didn't agree with it after I left the State Department for a few reasons. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3922.48s)]
*  Look, in terms of the bombing campaign and Feria made the point in a very tendentious way, but but not in a particularly incorrect way. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3927.48s)]
*  Factually, you know, you look at the U.S. Air Force record in Afghanistan, for example, you look at it in Syria or Iraq as well as unfortunately sometimes in Yemen. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3938.96s)]
*  Have we hit funerals? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3951.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3954.96s)]
*  Have we hit wedding parties? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3955.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3956.96s)]
*  Have we caused civilian casualties? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3957.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3960.96s)]
*  Did we do it on purpose? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3961.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3963.96s)]
*  Did we do it out of recklessness? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3965.44s)]
*  No. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3968.44s)]
*  We did it because these things are unfortunate, you know, aspects of a conflict and unfortunately they happen. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3969.44s)]
*  And I would say the same thing about Saudi Arabia. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3978.44s)]
*  I mean, people throw around this idea that war crimes have been committed. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3981.44s)]
*  I don't believe that war crimes have been committed. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3985.44s)]
*  I think that there have been unfortunate incidents. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3987.44s)]
*  The funeral party, the funeral of the dead, the funeral of the dead. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3990.44s)]
*  The funeral party incident last year being the most dramatic aspect of that, but there are other things. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=3994.92s)]
*  I think always the importance in this is to is to investigate, to understand what happened, what went wrong. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4001.92s)]
*  Sometimes the funeral party incident, I think that the government of Saudi Arabia did do an investigation. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4009.92s)]
*  And I think that they came back with a report and said that this was a result of bad intelligence, that they were misguided or misunderstood what the nature of this gathering was. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4018.4s)]
*  And therefore they thought that they were hitting a Houthi group. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4029.4s)]
*  So, you know, I think that it's important. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4035.4s)]
*  And where we were engaged earlier on in the conflict was trying to work with the Saudis in trying to help improve all of those aspects of their performance. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4039.88s)]
*  You know, how do you minimize the number of these kinds of incidents? [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4052.88s)]
*  And I would say that if you look at the trend line, you know, there is a decline in the number of these things over these past years. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4061.36s)]
*  So I think that more engagement rather than less engagement is the key to all of this and always recommended that. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4071.36s)]
*  And I think that we were also working very carefully and closely with the Saudis on doing more to ensure that everybody who was involved in these operations [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4081.84s)]
*  understood what the laws of armed conflict were, what the various international responsibilities were if you were doing these things. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4092.84s)]
*  And I think that also that in fact you could make sure that people were observing all of the relevant international law. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4102.32s)]
*  And I think that that's the right way to go forward. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4109.32s)]
*  On the issue of allegations of Emirati torture in Makala, I think it's an important issue. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4113.32s)]
*  I think that there needs to be a full investigation. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4118.32s)]
*  I think that all of the parties involved have denied it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4121.32s)]
*  But I think that there needs to be a better understanding of what exactly happened, whether there was a truth. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4126.799999999999s)]
*  Why don't we follow up with the question? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4137.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, my own sense, I think that the fundamental elements of the initiative were good. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4143.799999999999s)]
*  The implementation of the initiative was mixed. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4151.28s)]
*  We, you know, after the agreement was completed, the international community, the ten embassies that were directly involved in this kind of divided up responsibilities [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4160.28s)]
*  of tracking the implementation of various components. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4173.28s)]
*  And the U.S. Embassy took responsibility for the military and security reorganization aspect. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4177.759999999999s)]
*  And I would say that, you know, as is obvious from what happened, our success was not spectacular. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4185.759999999999s)]
*  And it wasn't spectacular, primarily because the Salas continued to interfere and continued to try to ensure that leadership of the military [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4195.24s)]
*  remained loyal to them as opposed to loyalty to the state. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4212.24s)]
*  And that the government never felt strong enough to really change that, not the Minister of Defense, not the President. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4215.24s)]
*  Despite the fact that we had many conversations about the need to replace the leadership of the military. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4222.719999999999s)]
*  And so you had that. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4228.719999999999s)]
*  I would say that the National Dialogue Conference was generally a success. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4231.719999999999s)]
*  I think that, in fact, the final communique of the National Dialogue, the decisions that the National Dialogue reached were legitimate. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4235.719999999999s)]
*  And it was very difficult, of course, holding everybody together. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4250.2s)]
*  It was very difficult getting the Southerners to commit. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4255.2s)]
*  And the South is so deeply fractured that there was really no group, certainly no individual who could speak authoritatively for what the South wanted. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4257.2s)]
*  And so, you know, you had a lot of those kinds of problems. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4267.2s)]
*  But fundamentally, I think that the outcome wasn't bad. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4273.2s)]
*  And that many of the elements, I believe, will be part of the Yemeni fabric going forward. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4276.679999999999s)]
*  Yemeni governance, Yemeni society going forward, Yemeni economics going forward. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4283.679999999999s)]
*  And then you had the Constitutional Conference in Abu Dhabi over the summer of 2014. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4287.679999999999s)]
*  And again, you know, my understanding is that the outcome was very good. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4294.679999999999s)]
*  And everybody signed on to it. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4299.679999999999s)]
*  So I would say that the performance of the elements of the GCC initiative itself was pretty positive. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4302.16s)]
*  The problem that we had was that everything going on outside of the GCC initiative, you had a completely dysfunctional government. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4311.16s)]
*  Abdur-Rabbu Mansur Hadi had his strong points and his weak points. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4319.16s)]
*  But, you know, you can certainly say that his weak point was that he never understood the politics of his own society. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4324.639999999999s)]
*  He was never able to really provide the kind of leadership that Yemenis were looking for. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4331.639999999999s)]
*  I think that we had a golden opportunity in 2011, 2012. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4337.639999999999s)]
*  February 2012, when we had that election, I think that Hadi genuinely did have the support of the vast majority of Yemeni people. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4341.639999999999s)]
*  And what happened afterwards is that he was unable to take that popular support and translate it into the delivery of change that the Yemeni people wanted. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4351.12s)]
*  He was never able to do that. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4366.12s)]
*  Part of it was because of the dysfunctionality of his government. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4368.12s)]
*  It was because you had this kind of hybrid government with the GPC and the JMP both involved. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4372.12s)]
*  Neither side really committed to ensuring the success of the transition. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4378.599999999999s)]
*  Never putting their best people into the government. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4384.599999999999s)]
*  Using the government for various purposes. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4388.599999999999s)]
*  And then you had other elements, including primarily Ali Abdullah Saleh and the people around him, who were doing everything that they could to undermine the transition and undermine the government. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4395.599999999999s)]
*  We had, as you remember, we went for weeks and weeks and weeks without any power in Sana'a. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4407.08s)]
*  With continued attacks in Madrab, with everything that was going on. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4413.08s)]
*  That frustrated the Yemeni people and basically sapped all of the positive energy out of this political transition. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4418.08s)]
*  So when you say, what do you do to change that? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4426.08s)]
*  I think that the only thing that you can do to change that, and again to go back to the UN process, is if you can get a change in the political dynamics in Sana'a. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4429.5599999999995s)]
*  Where you can take those good positive elements that came out of the GCC initiative and you can get everybody committed. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4442.5599999999995s)]
*  And basically get focused on the fact that the GCC initiative, this is a transition. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4449.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not a permanent solution. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4454.5599999999995s)]
*  It was never intended to be a permanent solution. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4457.04s)]
*  It was only meant to get us from point A, which was the political conflict of 2011, to point B, which is to go back to the Yemeni people and give them the opportunity to say again what it is that they wanted. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4459.04s)]
*  And what kind of government they wanted and who they wanted to lead them. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4473.04s)]
*  And that was the only purpose of this. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4476.04s)]
*  This wasn't a permanent solution. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4478.04s)]
*  And to get everybody focused on that and everybody to accept that this is a legitimate transition that they want to see succeed. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4480.5199999999995s)]
*  And that they're willing to commit to the outcome of a political process. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4490.5199999999995s)]
*  I think part of the problem that we had is that neither the Houthis nor Ali Abdullah Saleh believed that they were going to win a political fight. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4494.5199999999995s)]
*  And therefore they didn't want the political fight to happen. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4502.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's why they made the move in 2014. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4505.5199999999995s)]
*  In terms of Ali Abdullah Saleh, my own view is I'm sorry that the Saudis missed him on those number of occasions that they tried. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4509.0s)]
*  And I think, and I've said, I've said in public, I've said to our friends in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi that I don't believe that there's any future in Yemen for the Saleh family. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4520.0s)]
*  I don't think that we will ever make the transition. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4538.48s)]
*  And one of the things that frustrates me is the reports that the Emiratis are talking to Ahmed about a role. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4540.48s)]
*  I think it would be, I think that the worst tragedy that we could have is if at the end of this process we end up with Ali Abdullah Saleh or Ahmed Ali Saleh back in the presidential palace. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4549.48s)]
*  And Sanaa, because that means that all of the suffering and everything that the Yemeni people have gone through over the six years since the beginning of the Arab Spring would be fundamentally for nothing. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4566.959999999999s)]
*  We would be right back where we started. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4578.959999999999s)]
*  And I think that that would be a tragedy. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4580.959999999999s)]
*  So I think that we need to push through. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4582.959999999999s)]
*  And at the end of the day, Salah needs to be out of the picture. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4585.959999999999s)]
*  Adwa, we've got the question on tribes. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4591.44s)]
*  Is it waning or wax? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4595.44s)]
*  I mean, obviously, during the war, the tribes have stepped in and they continue to resolve conflicts. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4597.44s)]
*  They continue to, of course, to varying degrees, they continue to maintain security in their areas on the highways that pass through their territory. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4606.44s)]
*  But that has also been changing. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4617.919999999999s)]
*  They've increasingly challenged. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4620.919999999999s)]
*  And I wouldn't say the tribal structure is breaking down. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4623.919999999999s)]
*  I mean, obviously, Yemeni tribes have been challenged by the war and the system has been kind of eroding. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4626.919999999999s)]
*  But it's not to the extent that we see in Afghanistan, for example, where 40 years of war have literally undermined the tribes. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4635.4s)]
*  So they're still there. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4646.4s)]
*  They're still functional. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4648.4s)]
*  They still have a lot to offer in terms of not just security, but governance and peace and reconciliation at the local level, feeding into a national level if possible. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4649.4s)]
*  But the continuation of the war is de-civilizing the tribes. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4660.879999999999s)]
*  To follow up on that, on first the comment of the president, that's one of the big issues since 2011. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4671.879999999999s)]
*  We had and have a freelance president, someone who doesn't want to do his full-time job. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4681.879999999999s)]
*  He's more or less a freelance. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4688.36s)]
*  He likes to work sometimes one day, one week a year. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4690.36s)]
*  He doesn't want to take it as a full-time job. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4694.36s)]
*  That's one of the biggest issues. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4696.36s)]
*  You have an electronic government in Riyadh and a freelance president who isn't really happy with the job he's in, like how it became tempting. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4698.36s)]
*  And that's one of the biggest challenges of 2216. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4707.36s)]
*  If you tomorrow end up with a beast deal that they go back to Sana'a, I bet you most of us in Riyadh don't want to go back. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4709.36s)]
*  It's too comfortable and it's too nice and they don't have that much intention. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4715.839999999999s)]
*  That's a problem because we do have a legitimate side in Yemen and an illegitimate side. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4719.839999999999s)]
*  That's basics. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4726.839999999999s)]
*  There is a side who did the coup, and they are illegitimate. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4728.839999999999s)]
*  And there is a side who more or less to a certain degree was at least illegitimate. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4732.839999999999s)]
*  Now they are both terrible sides. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4737.839999999999s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4740.839999999999s)]
*  They are both bad sides. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4741.839999999999s)]
*  They both have no chance of harming Yemen and Yemenis in various ways and in various different ways. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4744.32s)]
*  That's an issue that has reflected in everything, whether in the war, whether in the negotiation, whether in the black market, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4750.32s)]
*  or whether the overall presence of the country and the overall consequences of the war. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4757.32s)]
*  In matter of ISIS and Qaeda, I went to Baida, the same village where Trump did his first raid actually. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4761.32s)]
*  In terms of Qaeda, ISIS is still a pilot program in Yemen. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4769.799999999999s)]
*  It's still in the pilot stage. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4774.799999999999s)]
*  It's still trying to test out how it is going to work. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4776.799999999999s)]
*  It will face a tremendous challenge compared to Al-Qaeda. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4779.799999999999s)]
*  ISIS first is too violent, and then they face the same problem diplomats usually face in Yemen. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4784.799999999999s)]
*  They don't speak the local language. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4792.799999999999s)]
*  They have a very short-sighted time limit that they want to get this done while things in Yemen take a long time. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4795.28s)]
*  Think of Qaeda like sheikhs. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4801.28s)]
*  They are very close to the society. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4804.28s)]
*  They spend a long time. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4806.28s)]
*  Think of ISIS like a foreigner, someone who is in a hurry, someone who doesn't speak, well-embraced in the society. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4808.28s)]
*  That being said, I don't think in the long term there will be a problem as much as Qaeda. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4814.28s)]
*  Qaeda, in my opinion, remains on Yemen, remains more of a threat and more of a strategic threat than ISIS. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4819.759999999999s)]
*  On the long term, it's dangerously because of what Nader is talking about. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4824.759999999999s)]
*  They can't talk to the tribe and that they can't embrace it or the tribe can't embrace them or vice versa. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4828.759999999999s)]
*  ISIS is too violent for Yemenis. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4833.759999999999s)]
*  Yemenis fight. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4836.759999999999s)]
*  They fight, but they're not violent. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4837.759999999999s)]
*  It's a very different society. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4839.759999999999s)]
*  If you look into the long term, the long history of violence we have been with, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4841.759999999999s)]
*  it has been weirdly, even from a political point of view, managed. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4846.24s)]
*  The tribes fight for 50 years and 10 of them get killed. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4851.24s)]
*  There is a way, there is an experience with conflict that comes into this country. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4855.24s)]
*  That's why I think it doesn't have much chance compared to it. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4860.24s)]
*  Now, why is it always open? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4864.24s)]
*  It's a serious problem. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4867.24s)]
*  We ask the same question, but this goes back to 3,000 years. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4870.24s)]
*  We talked according to the Bible, we talked to Solomon. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4873.719999999999s)]
*  We actually brought the Persians at one point. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4876.719999999999s)]
*  We actually joined Islam by a litter. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4878.719999999999s)]
*  It's a society and it's a country that's open. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4880.719999999999s)]
*  Pragmatic. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4883.719999999999s)]
*  Pragmatic and adaptive and responsive to the world. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4884.719999999999s)]
*  We have been Marxists, we have been monarchists, we have been Republicans, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4887.719999999999s)]
*  we have joined Islam, we worshiped the sun, we were Christians, we were Jews. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4890.719999999999s)]
*  It's an unbelievably dynamic country and it's open for ideologies, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4895.719999999999s)]
*  it's open for F-16s, it's open for the drones, you know. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4899.719999999999s)]
*  It's open for all of that. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4903.2s)]
*  That's a plus and a problem, but that's Yemen, a very dynamic country that goes in response [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4904.2s)]
*  and it takes a lot of, you know, it can exhaust you. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4909.2s)]
*  Nasser was there, everyone was there. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4912.2s)]
*  I don't know much about the economy, to be honest, but it is not that promising, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4915.2s)]
*  for example, from an economic point of view compared to a country like the Gulf or countries [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4922.2s)]
*  in the Gulf or other places. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4928.2s)]
*  It's not that much of a place. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4929.2s)]
*  I would add something on the economy. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4933.2s)]
*  Can I just say one thing with regard to Hadi versus Saleh? [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4935.2s)]
*  A friend of mine said this is the problem in Yemen's conflict, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4939.2s)]
*  the key problem in Yemen's conflict since 2011. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4944.2s)]
*  We have Saleh who is not convinced that he is no longer a president [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4947.2s)]
*  and Hadi who is not convinced that he is a president. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4954.2s)]
*  That's the truth. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4958.2s)]
*  If I can just say a word on the economy, it's certainly true that on the natural resources side, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4959.679999999999s)]
*  Yemen isn't especially rich, although when I was there, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4965.679999999999s)]
*  we were certainly proposing that the U.S. Geological Survey should come out and do. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4969.679999999999s)]
*  They had done a study many years ago, but it was at a time when the technology wasn't nearly [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4975.679999999999s)]
*  as advanced as it is now and that we always thought that it would be worthwhile to come out [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4980.679999999999s)]
*  and do another look at what mineral resources might be available. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4986.16s)]
*  You have the port of Aden, which potentially is an extremely important economic asset. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4990.16s)]
*  You have geographical location. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4997.16s)]
*  But what I would say is the idea that we were trying to push when I was there was, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=4999.16s)]
*  I agree completely with Farid's analysis of the Yemeni people, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5006.16s)]
*  you've got the people. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5014.639999999999s)]
*  You've got 26 million people who work hard, which is not always true of their neighbors. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5015.639999999999s)]
*  And you can use Yemen really to establish various kinds of production and other things, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5022.639999999999s)]
*  particularly low-tech, low-energy requirements, where I think that Yemen could be a source of production [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5034.639999999999s)]
*  for the entire region, and especially because if, in fact, the GCC follows through on some [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5044.12s)]
*  of the proposals that have been made over these last couple of years, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5050.12s)]
*  that they would bring Yemen more completely into economic association with the GCC. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5054.12s)]
*  I think that Yemen would have a lot to offer in terms of how the regional economy develops. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5060.12s)]
*  We've got time for one more question, I think. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5068.599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5077.599999999999s)]
*  Fouad Shah from the National Center for State Courts. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5078.599999999999s)]
*  Two questions, but they connect. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5082.599999999999s)]
*  What is the end game, the real, real end game for the Houthis, Ali Abdullah Saleh? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5086.599999999999s)]
*  We know, as the ambassador mentioned, there is no future for him. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5093.599999999999s)]
*  I highly doubt it. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5097.08s)]
*  And the Houthis are not seen as a group that's going to rule Yemen, rule it in a sense of governance. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5098.08s)]
*  Born Yemen, a Southerner, and a development practitioner, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5108.08s)]
*  I cannot see the South returning back to what Yemen was pre-Civil War. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5114.08s)]
*  I was there during the Civil War that people forgot about in the mid-1990s. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5121.5599999999995s)]
*  This was a couple years after the unification. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5126.5599999999995s)]
*  There is deep, deep-seated grievances in the South. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5128.5599999999995s)]
*  The idea of power sharing came and went. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5132.5599999999995s)]
*  They felt that they were tricked, simply put. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5135.5599999999995s)]
*  The idea of a united Yemen is very hard to really fathom with the conflict time and time again, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5138.5599999999995s)]
*  the Southerners see as, we don't want this anymore. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5146.5599999999995s)]
*  So my question is, one, what is the end game of the Houthis? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5150.04s)]
*  Do they want an autonomous region up north? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5155.04s)]
*  And they're happy with that? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5157.04s)]
*  Do they want to be a 50-50 power brokers of the north? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5159.04s)]
*  Ali Abdullah Saleh, what is he still trying to get from all of this, his family? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5163.04s)]
*  But again, what is Yemen after this war? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5168.04s)]
*  Will it be like Iraq, you have the Kurds, you have the Shia, Sunni? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5172.04s)]
*  Or will it just be back to something we don't even know? [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5179.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, or they don't, the Yemenis don't know. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5182.5199999999995s)]
*  So my question is, the northern part and the Southerners, and what is their future, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5184.5199999999995s)]
*  let alone the future of Yemen as a government, united government? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5190.5199999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5195.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, we can't finish that today. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5200.5199999999995s)]
*  It's... [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5202.5199999999995s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5204.0s)]
*  What does... [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5205.0s)]
*  One thing with Saleh specifically, he thought in 2011 he can pull out the Putin-Medvedev thing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5207.0s)]
*  He can bring someone for two years and then come back from the window. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5215.0s)]
*  That's one reason why he actually... [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5219.0s)]
*  And he had a deal with Hadi about that, by the way. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5221.0s)]
*  And that's why he was later frustrated, is he thought he can play this and for a lack of sense of a better term, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5223.0s)]
*  he thought that the revolution was a fake deal, something everyone is plotting against him [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5233.48s)]
*  and he would just deal with it like he does when the criticism comes back. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5237.48s)]
*  So that's why he became very destructive after that. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5240.48s)]
*  He wants three things today. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5243.48s)]
*  That's his endgame, I think, in Yemen, my endgame. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5245.48s)]
*  He wants immunity to continue, which is a bit tricky. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5247.48s)]
*  He wants his money from sanctions. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5251.48s)]
*  This is more important to him than Saleh. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5253.48s)]
*  He wants the sanctions to be removed, especially his financial one. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5255.48s)]
*  And that's a pretty tricky another condition. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5259.48s)]
*  You probably can play with it via the Iran model, which is you behave, [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5261.959999999999s)]
*  we remove some things in two years, blah, blah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5265.959999999999s)]
*  You just make sure that this is not a new license for him again to do whatever he wants. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5267.959999999999s)]
*  And he wants his son president of the party. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5271.959999999999s)]
*  That's his third thing. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5274.959999999999s)]
*  And he will have to step for that. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5276.959999999999s)]
*  He's the one blocking his son from that thing. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5278.959999999999s)]
*  But these are, I think, his endgame, ultimately. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5280.959999999999s)]
*  The Houthis are still trying to figure it. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5283.959999999999s)]
*  They at one point thought that they can't run Yemen. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5285.959999999999s)]
*  They were surprised. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5288.959999999999s)]
*  They took the capital and they're like, oh, so we can go to Aden. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5291.44s)]
*  So we can go into, oh, OK. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5295.44s)]
*  So there was something for them, actually. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5297.44s)]
*  And after that, they have been just in a mood of fighting. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5299.44s)]
*  I don't think they have had the chance to reflect. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5303.44s)]
*  Because as soon as they started thinking, they fought with Saleh. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5305.44s)]
*  Oh, we actually have a problem here. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5309.44s)]
*  Someone is sharing with us. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5311.44s)]
*  Someone is going to compete with us. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5313.44s)]
*  That's, I think, the most important thing into thinking about it. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5315.44s)]
*  I leave the south to the guys. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5319.919999999999s)]
*  But one final important point I want to make is [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5321.919999999999s)]
*  and this is a way that everyone is addressing Yemen's conflict. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5324.919999999999s)]
*  And it's a problem whether we speak of the Saudis or we speak of the Americans. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5327.919999999999s)]
*  In Saudi, I was also there in June. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5331.919999999999s)]
*  Every single thing has to do with Yemen is in the hand of the intelligence. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5334.919999999999s)]
*  There is no diplomats working on it. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5338.919999999999s)]
*  There is no politicians doing with it. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5340.919999999999s)]
*  It's in the hand of officers in the intelligence committee [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5342.919999999999s)]
*  who have no experience in politics [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5345.919999999999s)]
*  and who have a very similar to America's narrative toward Yemen. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5348.4s)]
*  They have a lot of data, but they don't have information. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5351.4s)]
*  And there is quite a big difference. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5354.4s)]
*  And they are not able to capture Yemen. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5356.4s)]
*  This is a war, but you fight it with diplomacy more than with F-16s. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5359.4s)]
*  And they have completely failed in that. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5362.4s)]
*  Even the aid when it goes to Yemen is actually a military intelligence decided. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5364.4s)]
*  Even the ones who deliver the aid is actually from the intelligence. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5369.4s)]
*  And that has made Saudi very much unable to understand Yemen. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5372.4s)]
*  Since Prince Sultan died and since the princes were left out of this politics [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5376.879999999999s)]
*  and it was handed to officers, they never really got Yemen right. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5379.879999999999s)]
*  And that will be one of the biggest challenges to move forward on that. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5383.879999999999s)]
*  My very final point is about the Gulf, about joining the GCC, if it remains, hopefully. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5387.879999999999s)]
*  This has been one of the biggest problems with the Gulf. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5394.879999999999s)]
*  They have been complaining for the last three years [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5398.879999999999s)]
*  that Yemen has fallen into the hand of Iran. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5401.879999999999s)]
*  But they have shut down their door in front of Yemen and Yemenis for the last 30 years [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5405.36s)]
*  from joining the GCC. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5411.36s)]
*  If you are unhappy with Iran taking over, then you need to open your door. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5413.36s)]
*  You cannot basically, you know, disattach Yemen, disattach geography, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5416.36s)]
*  and then complain that it is falling into the hand of other power. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5420.36s)]
*  That's a serious issue. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5423.36s)]
*  But there is a tendency within the Gulf, for some reason, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5424.36s)]
*  and I don't think it's a purpose, but it's just an attitude, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5428.36s)]
*  there is a tendency to punish Yemenis for what their leaders do. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5431.36s)]
*  Think of 1990, when Saleh sided with Saddam. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5434.839999999999s)]
*  What happens? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5437.839999999999s)]
*  Instead of pushing Saleh out of power, they kicked out 800,000 Yemenis from the Gulf labor. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5438.839999999999s)]
*  And that is one of the main reasons why Yemen is in the mess it is today, actually. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5443.839999999999s)]
*  That was the most expensive no in the history of the country. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5447.839999999999s)]
*  The vote he did inside the UN Security Council. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5450.839999999999s)]
*  But again, the way to approach it was the same way that they have done with this war, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5453.839999999999s)]
*  is deal with it the wrong way and actually not deal with the problem as it emerged in the past. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5457.839999999999s)]
*  So with regard to unification, I share what Farah said. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5464.839999999999s)]
*  Farah talked about three different Yemenis that he saw when he... [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5471.839999999999s)]
*  Yemen, and I think there is even more than that. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5475.839999999999s)]
*  I was in Aden last October, and I saw a de facto secession. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5479.839999999999s)]
*  The South is already seceded in effect. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5486.839999999999s)]
*  Having said that, there is a lot of disparities in the South. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5490.32s)]
*  And right now there is power struggle between the Emiratis and Hadi. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5495.32s)]
*  And Hadi, even though he's not very popular, he still has a lot of supporters in Abyan in the South. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5499.32s)]
*  And I think there could potentially be in the future potential power struggle between the Emiratis and the Saudis in the South as well. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5507.32s)]
*  And that's true to other areas like Qais and maybe other areas as well. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5517.799999999999s)]
*  So Yemen unity, I think, sadly, I think it's highly unlikely that we will see one Yemen the way it used to be. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5523.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I would just say, you know, I agree that you won't see Yemen as it used to be. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5536.28s)]
*  That's probably not a bad thing. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5545.28s)]
*  The National Dialogue Conference did come out with a recommendation on decentralization [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5547.28s)]
*  and trying to push decision making down to a more local level. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5553.28s)]
*  They did embrace the idea of federalism. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5559.28s)]
*  I think that it was mismanaged. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5563.759999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5567.759999999999s)]
*  It was mismanaged. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5569.759999999999s)]
*  But I think that the idea that Yemen should be a federal state is actually probably the right answer for the country. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5571.759999999999s)]
*  I believe that unity for Yemen is absolutely an essential element, not only for Yemen, but for the region and the world. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5577.759999999999s)]
*  Because I think that the reality is that a divided Yemen means that you'll have failed states. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5589.24s)]
*  And no reason to think that Yemen, if it were divided, would only divide into two pieces. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5600.24s)]
*  I think it would divide at least into three and maybe even more than three pieces. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5606.24s)]
*  And all of which would be susceptible to violent extremism, all of which would lack economic capacity to support their people. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5610.719999999999s)]
*  And it would just become an enduring problem in the region. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5620.719999999999s)]
*  So I think that we should continue to push for a unified Yemen, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5624.719999999999s)]
*  but with changes in the structure that address the legitimate concerns of the people in the South as well as elsewhere. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5630.719999999999s)]
*  And that's one main difference between UAE and Saudi. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5638.2s)]
*  Saudi realizes that or have the belief that Yemen must remain one. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5640.2s)]
*  And because it has a different narrative toward Yemen, because it shares the borders, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5646.2s)]
*  it doesn't want to deal with more than one headache. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5650.2s)]
*  It just wants one more is more than enough already. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5652.2s)]
*  That's a difference from UAE, where it doesn't have a border, and it's quite adventurous, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5655.2s)]
*  and it wants to do some, to try to test out some things, including the vision of how many Yemen's there should be. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5659.2s)]
*  I do agree that federalism or something around it has to be the Al-Tia ultimately, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5666.679999999999s)]
*  but it has to be thought of the last division of labor or of the region, which actually sparked this war, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bXSxsTBcUQ&t=5671.679999999999s)]
